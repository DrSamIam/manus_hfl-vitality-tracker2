    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m going to talk quickly talk about Nattokinase and how to correctly use it to help support healthy:\n\nblood flow & circulation\n\nNaturally thin your blood\n\nDecrease Fibrin build-up\n\nAll of this will obviously help support healthy circulation throughout your body, your brain, and muscles, and thus, help avoid heart health problems.\n\nI\u2019ll also reveal the best form, dosages, warnings, what should be avoided, and how to best utilize Nattokinase for maximum results and safety.\n\nWhat Is Nattokinase & How Does It Work\n\nNattokinase is an enzyme in food called NATTO, which is a fermented soybean product in Asian countries. Many people say it smells horrible but have some remarkable properties.\n\nThis is why taking the supplement form is ideal and most convenient.\n\nBasically, Nattokinase helps fight Fibrin Buildup, which is an insoluble protein formed from fibrinogen during the clotting of blood.\n\nIt forms a fibrous mesh that impedes the flow of blood (not what you want).\n\nThis decreased blood flow leads to a feeling of fatigue and gets you tired more easily, slowly leading to heart problems.\n\nIt also negatively affects your brain.\n\nSimply stated, Nattokinase is one of nature\u2019s natural blood thinners.\n\nAs far as dosage, the correct clinically effective dose starts at 100 mg daily, which is 2,000 FU (fibrinolytic units)\n\nBest Form Of Nattokinase\n\nNow, don\u2019t go purchase Nattokinase just yet. There are different forms and brands.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to get ripped off or take something that\u2019s worthless or worst, unsafe for you.\n\nThe best one is the patented NSK-SD\u00ae, which contains purified nattokinase.\n\nThis clinically proven version is extracted through a patented process. It\u2019s manufactured with a specialized\u201a non-GMO strain of soybeans known as Bacillus subtilis natto.\n\nNattokinase NSK-SD\u00ae was the first supplement of this kind introduced into the U.S. market and its authenticity has been certified by regulatory bodies such as the JNKA (Japan Nattokinase Association) and JHFA (Japan Health and Nutrition Food Authorization).\n\nThey are like the FDA but in Japan.\n\nEvery single batch is tested to make sure that it\u2019s potent and safe. All other nattokinase supplements are sub-par to NSK-SD\u00ae.\n\nNow, just because something is \u201cnatural\u201d, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe or doesn\u2019t create imbalances when taken alone.\n\nRemember, the human body is very complex and there are \u201cchecks and balances\u201d. As one thing goes up, something else may come down.\n\nSo, it\u2019s all about synergy and balance.\n\nFirst, if you thin the blood too much, you can bleed to death in an accident or have excessive bruising.\n\nSo, it\u2019s best to take Nattokinase with a specific form of Vitamin K2-7 (Menaquinone MK7) which helps control blood clotting and balances everything out.\n\nAdditionally, K2-7 also takes calcium OUT of the arteries and puts it in the bone, where it belongs.\n\nThis further helps support healthy blood flow.\n\nAlso, blood clots consist of two main materials, fibrin, and platelets.\n\nWhile nattokinase contributes to normal blood clotting by helping maintain normal fibrin levels in your blood, you also want to inhibit platelet aggregation, which causes platelets to get sticky and slow \u2026 this obviously can cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\nSimply stated, you want better blood flow and unsticky blood that has smoother circulation.\n\nThis is best done with the addition of ginger extract (15% extract) and a blend of four different Magnesium (Magnesium Glycinate Chelate, Magnesium Citrate, Magnesium Aspartate, Magnesium Oxide)\n\nLastly, since your goal is for healthy blood flow and circulation, we also want to strengthen the arteries and veins, make them more flexible and pliable, and thus, help prevent ruptures and tears \u2013 which is very common when we are under stress, overweight, have high blood pressure, cholesterol or blood sugar levels.\n\nSo, you also want to take Vitamin E, N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC), and different forms of Carnitine (Acetyl, Glycine Propionyl, and L Fumarate) and white willow extract.\n\nWhen combined with the above ingredients, Nattokinase creates a \u201csynergy\u201d where you get even MORE benefits, with dramatically faster results.\n\nSaving you both time and money.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best, Easiest & Safest Solution?\n\nSo now you might be thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take 10 or 20 pills per day, buy a bunch of bottles and herbs\u201d\u2026 And I don\u2019t blame you \u2013 who\u2019s got the time or money?\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a natural product called Blood Flow Optimizer, which contains all the above key ingredients, at the correct clinically proven dosages\u2026 in addition to a couple of other helpful ingredients.\n\nThe feedback for it has been amazing. It\u2019s a proven and time-tested product that has been around for over 15+ years, so you know it works and is safe.\n\nIt\u2019s actually something I use myself and so do my own parents.\n\nSo give it a try and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4479826/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6043915/",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/21-foods-that-are-clinically-proven-to-clean-your-arteries-help-avoid-a-heart-attack-or-stroke/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and having a healthy heart, clean arteries and strong blood flow + circulation is more important than ever.\n\nConsidering heart problems is the #1 killer in the world, killing more people each year than all the other causes, I figured I\u2019d write a short article about the 21 best foods that can help clean your arteries, support healthy blood flow and circulation\u2026 and help you avoid heart problems.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started:\n\nAtherosclerosis is when the arteries harden, which is caused by inflammation. A yellow spice known as turmeric contains the active ingredient curcumin, which supports a healthy inflammatory response in the arteries. This in turn supports healthy blood flow.\n\nFruits rich with antioxidants improve the walls of the arteries. Pomegranate is especially heart-friendly due to the presence of phytochemicals that are powerful antioxidants. Pomegranate increases the production of nitric oxide, which supports healthy blood flow and expands the arteries.\n\nBroccoli is a good source of protein for vegetarians. Broccoli contains vitamin K which is beneficial for bone formation. Vitamin K also protects the arteries from damage by taking cholesterol out of the blood and into your bones, where it should be. Besides vitamin K, broccoli is rich in fiber, which supports healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.\n\nSeafood is beneficial on various levels \u2013 mental health, brain, vision, building muscles, and also acts as a potent anti-inflammatory. One of the reasons for all of these benefits is the high levels of Omega 3 fatty acids \u2013 which protect your heart and support healthy lipid and triglyceride levels. The best fish is wild-caught salmon.\n\nAlmonds, walnuts, or hazelnuts are heart-friendly nuts. These nuts contain vitamin E which can protect the walls of the arteries. Nuts also contain fibers that also help support healthy cholesterol levels in the blood. However, the best \u201cheart health\u201d nut is probably walnuts because they are also high in Omega 3 fats.\n\nMonounsaturated Fats (Olive and/or Macadamia Nut oil)\n\nOlive oil is known to have several health benefits, but it is one of the best oils to prevent a buildup of cholesterol in the blood. Besides cholesterol, olive oil can also support healthy blood pressure. Olive oil comes under monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are both beneficial fats for the body. Olives also contain powerful polyphenols. Don\u2019t cook with olive oil, eat it raw.\n\nAnother monounsaturated fat, similar to Olive oil, is Macadamia nut oil. It\u2019s also very heart-friendly. The one benefit is that you CAN heat and cook Macadamia nut oil when you shouldn\u2019t the olive oil.\n\nCinnamon has many benefits. The first is that it lowers fats in your blood, which helps prevent blockages in the vessels. Additionally, it helps support healthy blood sugar levels. Most people don\u2019t know that high blood sugar and insulin corrode the lining of your vessels and arteries, making them weak.\n\nOranges are great because they\u2019re high in vitamin C, which helps lower the stress hormone, cortisol. This is important because it also helps support healthy inflammatory responses. Additionally, oranges contain a fiber called pectin, which helps support healthy cholesterol levels and also healthy blood flow.\n\nTea has many health benefits, especially for your heart. One of the best is green tea because it helps improve your metabolism, which can help you lose weight \u2013 which is always beneficial for your heart. Green tea also contains antioxidants such as polyphenols, which can help strengthen arterial walls and also reduce blood clots.\n\nWatermelon contains an amino acid called Citrulline, which helps increase nitric oxide levels. This relaxes and dilates blood vessels and thus, helps support healthy blood flow and circulation.\n\nSpinach contains carotene, which helps prevent cholesterol from getting clogged in the arteries. Spinach can also help support healthy blood pressure, which is another bonus.\n\nLike pomegranate and tea, tomato too contains antioxidants that protect the arterial walls. In tomatoes, lycopene supports healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.\n\nBeans contain fiber and folic acid, which prevents arteries from getting clogged. Beans are also a good source of low-glycemic carbohydrates, which means your blood sugar won\u2019t spike up.\n\nLike oranges, apples also contain the fiber, pectin \u2026 which absorbs cholesterol from the blood. However, make sure you eat the skin, that\u2019s where the majority of the fiber is.\n\nThe pink grapefruit is rich in the antioxidant lycopene, which is also present in tomatoes. Pink grapefruit helps prevent damage to your arteries and doesn\u2019t affect blood sugar levels very much.\n\nOne of the best vegetables for clearing arteries is asparagus because it\u2019s full of fiber and minerals, as well as a long list of \u201cheart-healthy\u201d vitamins including K, B1, B2, C, and E. Asparagus is a natural diuretic, that supports healthy blood pressure and prevents blood clots!\n\nStudies have shown that the daily consumption of avocado results in healthy blood cholesterol and triglycerides and LDL (\u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) of around 22% and an 11% increase in HDL \u2013 the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol. All of this keeps your arteries clean and supports healthy blood flow.\n\nThe fiber and alpha-linolenic acid contained in just two ounces of Chia seeds can help keep arteries clear by supporting healthy blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increasing HDL cholesterol.\n\nDisregard the old myth that all saturated fats are bad and the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis. Regular consumption of coconut oil \u2013 about 2 or 3 tablespoons per day \u2013 can help to reduce plaque build-up in the arteries by aiding the conversion of cholesterol in the bloodstream into a form that our bodies can use. This way, there won\u2019t be plaque buildup in your arteries.\n\nI know a lot of people think carbohydrates are bad, but they aren\u2019t. Man-made, \u201cbleached\u201d carbs such as certain bread, pastries, and snacks should be avoided. However, whole-grain bread, rice, quinoa, barley, and oatmeal have good amounts of fiber, support healthy cholesterol levels, keep arteries clear, and your colon happy.\n\nGinger has many amazing qualities. It\u2019s anti-inflammatory and works similarly to aspirin, but without any side effects. Ginger fights against atherosclerosis, which is the hardening of the arteries. Ginger inhibits abnormal platelet aggregation, which is a part of blood that can \u201cclump\u201d together and cause blood clotting. Ginger may also increase ATP production in the heart and enhance calcium transport within heart cells.\n\nSo there you have it\u2026 21 foods that can help clean your arteries.\n\nEat as many of them as you can and stay consistent by eating at least 1-2 of these foods daily.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to exercise!\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nAmerican Heart Association News.

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal why having healthy blood flow is one of the most important aspects of longevity.\n\nI decided to redo and update this topic in 2025 since it is so important for your overall health.\n\nI Made A Huge Mistake\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m going to confess to the fact that years ago, I made a huge mistake by not focusing on healthy blood flow and circulation.\n\nI spent a lot more time improving my parents and clients:\n\nLosing unwanted body fat\n\nI did this because I have a family history of heart problems and these are all primary contributing factors. In fact, heart problems kill more people each year than all the other diseases combined.7\n\nThe Common Denominator\n\nHowever, what I mistakenly overlooked was the fact that all of these factors have ONE thing in common: poor blood flow and circulation.\n\nMost people, including myself and other doctors, take for granted how crucial healthy blood flow is to your longevity and vitality.\n\nProblems Associated With Poor Circulation\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize that poor circulation can lead to1-6\n\nPeripheral artery disease (PAD), causes numbness, and nerve and tissue damage.\n\nBlood pressure and blood sugar problems\n\nMemory and cognition problems. Remember, blood runs through your entire body AND brain.\n\nRaynaud\u2019s disease, which has cold hands and feet.\n\nAccelerated aging \u2014 hair loss, wrinkling, varicose veins, fat gain, and muscle loss.\n\nFor guys, erectile problems and impotence. Even shrinkage of penis size!\n\nIn fact, there are many other problems associated with poor blood flow, but I think you get the point.\n\nVital Nutrients In Your Blood\n\nWhat you and I both need to remember is that your blood contains:\n\nOxygen, which gives life to every cell in your body, proteins, to help repair and grow muscle, hair, organs, bones, etc.\n\nAnti-aging hormones, which make you look and feel young\u2026 And enzymes, nutrients, and everything you need to live\u2026 To grow, heal and thrive!\n\nOf course, babies have the best blood flow and you can clearly see it in the glow of their skin, eyes, hair, and how quickly they heal and grow.\n\nProblem With Poor Blood Flow\n\nUnfortunately, as we age, our blood flow isn\u2019t as strong as it used to be. Plaque, heavy metals, and calcium build up in your arteries, veins, and blood vessels\u2026\n\nReducing circulation and thus, there\u2019s less \u201clife-promoting\u201d oxygen getting to all your cells.\n\nUnfortunately, this results in less youthful hormones and nutrient-rich blood, being delivered to every muscle, organ, and moving body part.\n\nBecause of poor blood flow, your body slows down its internal healing and cleansing process.\n\nYou begin to get sick more often, or feel tired and fatigued. You become more forgetful.\n\nWill have more aches and pains, and eventually, you start to get injured more readily and often.\n\nYour skin loses that elasticity and youthful shine. Your hair begins to thin and look brittle and dry. Basically, you start to LOOK and FEEL \u201cOLD\u201d!\u2026\n\nAll because of poor blood flow and circulation!\n\nMy Dad\u2019s Heart Problems\n\nNow, I mention all of this because a few years ago my dad had serious heart problems, despite having healthy cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels.\n\nI was in shock when it all happened. However, the problem was poor blood flow to his brain.\n\nI write today\u2019s article because I don\u2019t want YOU or someone you know to go through the pain, suffering, and expense that my family did with my dad\u2019s stroke.\n\nI don\u2019t want you to put yourself at any health risk, including accelerated aging, all because you didn\u2019t focus on improving your blood flow and circulation.\n\nNow, under this article, I\u2019ve got a link to a simple, yet powerful option that supported healthy blood flow for my dad. Something you can easily \u201ccopy\u201d and use for yourself.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nCirculation problems: Controllable risks \u2013 Circulation problems.

    "content": "I received a question from Kimberly in 2025 and she asked:\n\n\u201cI have plaque buildup in my arteries. How can I \u201cunclog\u201d and clean my arteries, naturally? I heard this can\u2019t be done unless I have surgery or take really harmful drugs. You always seem to know a natural way to heal the body, anything for this?\u201d\n\nWell, it is correct that it\u2019s very difficult to remove plaque buildup from your arteries, but it is NOT impossible. I know it can be done because I\u2019ve done it many times \u2013 from my professional athletes to my older clients \u2026 including my own parents.\n\nSo the first thing we must do is REGULATE future plaque build-up and then, we can work on removing the current buildup.\n\nNow, this can take 6-12 months or longer, depending on your current situation. However, at end of today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll reveal a proven formula that can speed up this process.\n\nBy the way, this is a very important topic because plaque buildup reduces blood flow and circulation, which can cause heart problems obviously.\n\nHowever, it also causes things like:\n\nimpotence/erectile problems\n\nnumbness to your extremities (hands and feet)\n\nblood pressure problems\n\nand a host of other health problems.\n\nHow To Regulate Future Buildup\n\nThere\u2019s no point in trying to clean your arteries if you keep clogging them up daily. So, here are 3 simple tips for regulating future plaque build-up\u2026 while at the same time, helping UNCLOG current plaque.\n\n1 \u2014 Eat a heart-healthy diet\n\nDiet can play a big role in improving your heart health and reducing your risk for a buildup of plaque. It\u2019s never too late to eat a healthier diet. Just as years of bad eating can damage your body, good eating can help heal it and it can happen quickly.\n\nAdd more \u201chealthy\u201d fats to your diet. These are typically mono and polyunsaturated fats. They\u2019re found in foods like olives, raw seeds and nuts, avocados, and fish. These should be RAW and uncooked.\n\nEliminate \u201cunhealthy\u201d and artificial sources of trans fats. Most artificial trans fats are found in processed, packaged foods like cookies and snack cakes. These have been heated and are hydrogenated. They are also high in omega 6 fats, which cause inflammation.\n\nIncrease your fiber intake. Soluble fiber helps prevent and remove plaque buildup. You can find soluble fiber in foods like vegetables, lentils, beans, and oats. I would also add fiber supplements as well, especially if you have a hard time getting it all from food.\n\nCut back on sugar. The sugar found in processed foods like cookies, ice cream, and sugar-sweetened beverages has no nutritional value. Unfortunately, sugar is hidden in almost all \u201cman-made\u201d foods. They increase your blood sugar levels\u2026 Which when combined with unhealthy fats, clogs your arteries.\n\nFirst, we all need to move more. All we tend to do is sit all day long \u2014 computer, phone, driving, eating, work, etc.\n\nThe reason exercise is important is that it helps improve your youth hormones, which then helps your body naturally get rid of toxins \u2013 this includes plaque.\n\nAnd in my opinion, \u201cresistance exercise\u201d is more important than cardiovascular. This means lifting weights \u2013 which can be with free weights, machines, cables, or simply your own body weight.\n\nAnd if you work out quickly, it will also give you a very strong cardiovascular workout at the same time.\n\nYou only need 3x weekly and I would add in daily walking as well.\n\n3 \u2014 Take Specific Supplements\n\nTaking specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals that are clinically proven to help support healthy blood flow and circulation will give you the biggest and fastest improvements in preventing AND removing plaque buildup.\n\nAnd you can get more information about which ones are the best, by clicking the special link below this article. Of course, supplements do NOT take the place of a healthy lifestyle.\n\nHowever, when combined together, it\u2019s like being on \u201csteroids\u201d. You\u2019ll get much faster and more dramatic results, with LESS effort.\n\nAnd for many people, like my own parents, it made the biggest difference in REMOVING the plaque buildup \u2014 more so than preventing it.\n\nSo make sure you eat better, exercise, and take specific supplements.\n\nMake small improvements daily and within a few weeks and months, you\u2019ll see and feel dramatic improvements.\n\nOf course, I shouldn\u2019t have to say the obvious\u2026 but I need to:\n\nLose fat if you\u2019re overweight.\n\nLimit or eliminate alcohol\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025 and I got a question from Mrs. Wilson and she asked:\n\n\u201cWhat really causes poor circulation?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s important to know is that poor circulation isn\u2019t a \u201ccondition\u201d itself. It\u2019s the result of OTHER health issues. Poor blood flow and circulation are one of the primary causes of heart problems.\n\nThis is because it can lead to\n\nBlood pressure problems\n\nHardening and narrowing of your arteries\n\nCholesterol and plaque build-up\n\nThe good news is that this can be reversed and avoided naturally, without prescription medications, crazy diets, or exercise. And I\u2019ll reveal to you how in a minute\u2026\n\nBecause this is exactly the problem my dad has had for many years. In fact, he had a stroke a few years ago, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this article\u2026\n\nTo help you avoid the mistakes, pain, and suffering that we had to go through. But let\u2019s first talk about\u2026\n\nSome of the \u201d warning signs\u201d that you may have circulation problems include2\n\nFrequent pain and cramping in your legs\n\nTingling or numbness in your hands and/or feet\n\nTired, aching, or weak legs and feet\n\nVaricose and \u201cspider\u201d veins\n\nCauses of Poor Blood Flow\n\nThere are several different causes of poor circulation, but here are the top 5:\n\nPeripheral artery disease\n\nPeripheral artery disease (PAD) can lead to poor circulation in your legs and it generally affects people over the age of 50.\n\nPAD is a circulatory condition that causes the narrowing of your blood vessels and arteries.\n\nThis eventually decreases blood flow to your extremities and can result in pain\u2026 but more importantly can cause heart problems.\n\nBlood clots block the flow of blood, either partially or entirely.\n\nThey can develop almost anywhere in your body\u2026 but a blood clot that develops in your arms or legs can lead to circulation problems.\n\nVaricose veins are enlarged veins caused by valve failure. They\u2019re most often found on your legs.\n\nThese damaged veins can\u2019t move blood as efficiently as other veins, so poor circulation can become a problem.\n\nYour genes largely determine whether or not you\u2019ll develop varicose veins. The secondary is a change in your hormones due to aging.\n\nThis is why women are more likely to develop them, especially after menopause\u2026 As are people who are overweight or obese.\n\nBlood sugar problems also cause poor circulation throughout your body.\n\nPeople with advanced blood sugar problems may have difficulty detecting the signs of poor circulation.\n\nThis is because diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage caused by prolonged exposure to high blood sugar3) \u2026 can cause reduced sensation in your extremities, and feel similar to poor circulation.\n\nOf course, carrying around extra pounds puts a burden on your body.\n\nIf you\u2019re overweight, sitting or standing for hours, it will eventually lead to circulation problems.\n\nBeing overweight also puts you at an increased risk for many other causes of poor circulation\u2026 including blood sugar problems, varicose veins, and blood vessel problems.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to remember about poor blood flow and circulation, is that it\u2019s a result of OTHER health conditions\u2026. And if left untreated, can lead to heart problems.\n\nGenetics aside, the change in your hormones due to aging is a major cause of poor blood flow. As is being overweight\u2026 can typically cause numerous health problems as you may already know \u2026blood sugar problems are one of them, which further decreases circulation.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.healthline.com/health/poor-circulation-symptoms-causes\n\nhttp://www.footsmart.com/health-resource-center/leg/circulation\n\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-neuropathy/basics/causes/con-20033336",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to discuss a not-so-obvious problem to a very obvious problem. So, what the heck does this mean?\u2026\n\nThe \u201cobvious\u201d problem is smoking. I think everyone knows by now just how bad smoking is for you. And most people associate smoking to lung problems.\n\nHowever, most people don\u2019t realize that cigarette smoking causes 1 in every 5 deaths in the US. That\u2019s 20% of all deaths!\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s the main preventable cause of death and illness in the United States.\n\nAnd this is because smoking harms nearly every organ in your body\u2026 including the heart, blood vessels, lungs, eyes, mouth, reproductive organs, bones, bladder, and digestive organs.\n\nNow, a \u201cnot so obvious\u201d problem with smoking is that it causes major damage to your blood vessels and circulation!\n\nThe chemicals in tobacco smoke harm your blood cells.\n\nThey also can damage the function of your heart and the structure and function of your blood vessels. This damage increases your risk of atherosclerosis \u2014 which is a disease that causes plaque build-up in your arteries.\n\nOver time, plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen & nutrient-rich blood, to your organs and other parts of your body.\n\nNot only is this bad for your heart, but it dramatically increases your risk for heart problems. It\u2019s also one of the leading causes of AGING \u2014 for your body, skin, organs, and even brain!\n\nEven A \u201cLittle\u201d Is Too Much\n\nAny amount of smoking, even light smoking or occasional smoking, damages your heart and blood vessels.\n\nFor some people, such as women who use birth control pills and people who have blood sugar problems, smoking poses an even greater risk to the heart and blood vessels.\n\nSecondhand smoke has all the same problems as regular smoking, but it\u2019s just not as \u201cconcentrated\u201d.\n\nSecondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe. It also refers to smoke that\u2019s breathed out by a person who is smoking.\n\nMy point with today\u2019s short article is to remind you that smoking is bad for you, obviously\u2026 However, lung problems are the LEAST of your problems when it comes to smoking.\n\nA much bigger problem is the decrease in blood flow and circulation, which affect every organ and cell in your body.\n\nIf you\u2019re over the age of 35,\n\nyou have blood sugar or blood pressure problems,\n\nif you\u2019re overweight,\n\nyou live a high-stress life,\n\nif you don\u2019t exercise daily,\n\nyou don\u2019t eat healthy, etc., etc\u2026.\n\nThen smoking dramatically increases your risk for heart problems.\n\nIf nothing else, and you only care about your looks and vanity, smoking really AGES you \u2013 both internally, as well as externally.\n\nSo at this point, you need to first make a decision and COMMIT that you\u2019re going to STOP smoking permanently. If not for yourself, then for your family, friends, and loved ones. Because secondhand smoke can be almost as bad.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to naturally support healthy blood flow and circulation \u2013 whether the cause is from smoking or simple aging \u2013 then make sure you click the link below to know more about this topic.\n\nI guarantee it\u2019ll make a dramatic improvement in how you look and feel, while also helping avoid heart problems.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/tobaccosmoke/report/full_report.pdf\n\nRoger VL, et al.

    "content": "Sleeping in the wrong position for 8 hours every night can be very bad for blood flow & circulation.\n\nUnfortunately, most people when they get into bed, don\u2019t give much thought about their sleep position.\n\nThey pick whatever they\u2019re most comfortable with. Besides, most people toss and turn throughout the night, so however you may start, usually won\u2019t be the same as when you wake up.\n\nFor me, I almost always sleep on my back. Sleeping on my stomach hurts my lower back and neck. Sleeping on my sides hurts my shoulders.\n\nSo, I have no choice.\n\nBest Sleep Position For Blood Flow\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about improving your blood flow and circulation, especially to your heart, then the best position to sleep on is your LEFT side.\n\nThis is because when your heart pumps blood out to your body, it gets circulated and then flows back to the right side of your heart.\n\nBut if you sleep on your right side, the pressure of your body smashes up against the blood vessels and makes it more difficult to get the blood back to your heart.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s more work for your heart.\n\nIf you\u2019re older or have a weak heart or plaque buildup in your arteries, then this really puts a lot more pressure and stress and could result in a heart attack or stroke while sleeping.\n\nThis is also why pregnant women are told to sleep on their left side. The baby is taking up room and pushing the mom\u2019s organs upward, so there is less space.\n\nThe mother\u2019s heart is already working harder during the pregnancy.\n\nSo sleeping on the right side, where there is already less space and extra pressure from the organs being smashed together because of the baby, could hinder blood flow to the mom\u2019s heart, as well as the baby\u2019s.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to sleep on your side, you may consider using a body pillow for extra support and comfort\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

That\u2019s why I decided to update and redo this article in 2025.\n\nIt\u2019s more important than cholesterol and blood pressure levels. Without having to change your diet or exercise.\n\nBut first, let me reveal the top 10 foods that unclog your arteries, naturally.\n\nI\u2019ve listed them in alphabetical order\u2026\n\nAsparagus is a natural artery-clearing food. It can help to support healthy blood pressure and prevent blood clots that can cause cardiovascular illnesses.\n\nThis veggie is full of fiber and minerals, along with a long list of vitamins including K, B1, B2, C, and E.\n\nInstead of mayo on your burger or sandwich, switch it out for some avocado.\n\nStudies have shown that daily consumption of avocado results in healthy blood cholesterol (lower LDL and higher HDL).\n\nHDL cholesterol is the cholesterol that helps keep arteries clear of obstructions.\n\nWhether you love the stuff or hate it, broccoli is rich in Vitamin K, which helps to keep calcium from damaging the arteries.\n\nIt\u2019s also full of fiber, which can help to support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\nThis delicious spice can help to support healthy cholesterol levels while clearing out plaque and preventing further build-up.\n\nCinnamon is full of antioxidants that improve cardiovascular health by protecting blood from oxidation.\n\nSprinkle some in your coffee, on your toast, or on just about any other food to spice it up a little and reap the benefits!\n\nCranberries are another antioxidant-rich food that can reduce LDL and raise HDL cholesterol levels.\n\nIn fact, regular consumption of pure cranberry juice may help reduce your overall risk of heart problems by as much as 40%!\n\nGreen tea contains high levels of catechins, which hinder the absorption of cholesterol during digestion.\n\nDrinking a cup or two each day can help to improve your blood lipid levels and reduce arterial blockage.\n\nGreen tea also gives your metabolism a natural boost, which can aid in weight loss and support cardiovascular health.\n\nPersimmons are loaded with antioxidants and polyphenols, which work to decrease LDL and triglycerides.\n\nThey\u2019re also a great source of fiber, which helps to support healthy blood pressure and keep your arteries clear.\n\nThis fun fruit contains phytochemicals that act as antioxidants to protect the lining of the arteries against damage.\n\nPomegranate juice stimulates the body\u2019s production of nitric oxide, which helps to keep your blood flowing and your arteries open!\n\nIt might sound a little weird, but this blue-green alga helps to regulate lipid levels in the blood.\n\nIt\u2019s also a source of protein that contains all of the essential amino acids needed by the body to maintain optimum health.\n\nIt can help relax artery walls and stabilize blood pressure while balancing your blood fat levels.\n\nThis spice is a powerful anti-inflammatory. It works to lower inflammation, which is a major cause of arteriosclerosis \u2014 the hardening of the arteries.\n\nAdding turmeric to your diet can reduce damage to arterial walls, lowering your chances of a blood clot.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

First thing morning and/or late evening are good times, but whenever you can is better than nothing.\n\nTo start, all you need is about 15 minutes, 3x weekly.\n\nIdeally, you would work up to daily walks of about 30 minutes. And if you have pain or trouble walking, even 3 minutes is a good start.\n\nTry your best to walk just a little bit every single day.\n\nA rebounder is basically a mini-trampoline. I like this because it is very low impact and super easy on your joints.\n\nIt also helps clean your lymph nodes, which helps prevent many health problems.\n\nI put mine in front of the TV while watching a favorite show and do it for about 10-20 minutes daily. You don\u2019t need much at all.\n\nBy the way, you\u2019re not trying to jump high on it and try to touch the ceiling.\n\nYou only need to go up a few inches. Just enough for your toes to be off the rebounder.\n\nIt\u2019s just a light, up-and-down motion.\n\nAgain, almost anyone can do it, anytime and anyplace. You can even travel with it.\n\nThis last exercise is great for building and strengthening your entire lower body \u2026 From your ankles to your leg muscles and all the way to your lower back and stomach.\n\nYou can simply use your own body weight and do sets of about 15-20 repetitions.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re first starting out, simply doing even 2-3 comfortable repetitions is a great start. Go down as far as you are comfortable and without pain.\n\nOver time, as you get stronger and more flexible, you can do more repetitions and go deeper.\n\nIdeally, you would do maybe 1 set of 15 or more repetitions, 2-3x daily. Maybe in the morning, noon and nighttime.\n\nMore often and throughout the day helps keep the blood flow regular and continuous.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have good coordination, simply hold onto a wall or something sturdy as you squat down.\n\nPoor blood flow is bad for your health because it negatively affects your entire body.\n\nThe best exercises for improved circulation, especially in your legs, are:\n\nOf course, you should get the \u201cokay\u201d from your doctor before starting any exercise program.

    "content": "Poor circulation because of plaque buildup or thicker, stickier blood, can cause blood pressure problems and may lead to serious heart problems.\n\nThis is why having healthy blood flow is a vital key to living a healthier, longer, and more youthful life.\n\nThis is because your blood contains oxygen, proteins, enzymes, youthful hormones, and other nutrients that will help heal and repair your body.\n\nIf you want to improve your skin, hair, memory, muscle size, and even your performance in bed in 2025 you must improve your circulation.\n\nThe older we get, the worse our circulation becomes.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to reveal 3 vegetables to regulate plaque build-up & clean arteries.\n\nAsparagus For Plaque Build Up\n\nAll vegetables are great for your health, but asparagus is especially good for arterial health and blood flow.\n\nAsparagus boosts glutathione levels, which helps support healthy inflammatory responses and oxidation.\n\nAsparagus is also high in folic acid, which reduces the hardening of your arteries.\n\nAsparagus is also a natural diuretic, so it helps support healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nBroccoli For Plaque Build Up\n\nWhether you love the stuff or hate it, broccoli is rich in Vitamin K, which helps take calcium out of the arteries and puts it into the bones where it belongs.\n\nIt\u2019s full of fiber, which can help to support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\nIt\u2019s high in protein, omega 3 fatty acids, and is a powerful anti-inflammatory, which is very important for healthy arteries and circulation.\n\nIt also helps improve cholesterol levels and HDL/LDL ratios.\n\nCooking broccoli is super simple and fast because you only need to steam it for 2-5 min. Or better yet, just eat them raw.\n\nGarlic For Plaque Build Up\n\nGarlic is typically called a vegetable, even though it\u2019s hardly eaten on its own. It\u2019s mostly similar to an onion and treated the same way.\n\nGarlic has many health benefits.\n\nBut as far as artery-cleansing benefits, researchers found that regular intake of garlic may help prevent the hardening of the aorta, which is the main artery of the body, supplying oxygenated blood to the circulatory system. Garlic also helps reduce the \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.\n\nYou want to eat between 2-4 cloves of RAW garlic each day to get the benefits.\n\nKeep in mind that cooking destroys many of the health benefits.\n\nUnfortunately, your body will smell when eating raw garlic \u2013 your mouth, skin, hair, and your sweat.\n\nGarlic supplements will have the same \u201csmelly\u201d effects. And \u201codorless\u201d garlic supplements don\u2019t work.\n\nSo this is why garlic isn\u2019t one of my favorite foods, but it does have many clinically proven health benefits if you don\u2019t mind the smell.\n\nHealthy blood flow is extremely important for your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nTry to eat some asparagus or broccoli daily or at least 3x weekly. And if you feel adventurous, swallow some raw garlic cloves.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/3-things-you-didnt-know-can-cause-poor-blood-flow-circulation/",
    "content": "When you\u2019re young, you really don\u2019t give much thought to your health simply because you\u2019re healthy! You don\u2019t think about \u201cconsequences\u201d or the \u201cfuture\u201d. Because of the right hormones, you feel unstoppable.\n\nUnfortunately, the \u201cdamage\u201d you do to your body when you\u2019re young, eventually shows up later on in life, and sometimes it can be too late to \u201cfix\u201d or reverse.\n\nFor example, young people are generally unaware that poor blood flow and circulation can be very dangerous to their health because the symptoms aren\u2019t obvious while they\u2019re young.\n\nLater when they\u2019re older and they regularly see and feel the negative systems, they\u2019ll do anything and everything to fix it. Thus, an ounce of prevention really does go a long way.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss 3, little-known causes of poor blood flow and circulation.\n\nStudies have shown that drinking a glass of alcohol (distilled spirits, wine, or beer) a day can help the heart function better. It also helps maintain balance and the right proportions of fat in the blood and helps lower your chances of developing blood clots and blocked arteries.\n\nHowever, science also reveals that more than two drinks of alcohol a day can harm the heart. How?...\n\nLarge amounts of alcohol can affect how the heart works. If the heart isn\u2019t pumping blood throughout your body effectively, other organs may suffer from a lack of oxygen or nutrients.\n\nIf the person drinking has clogged blood vessels, the heart has to work even harder.\n\nStudies1 on middle-aged and older people resulted in linking binge drinking to a higher risk of heart health problems.\n\nBinge drinking may also lead to the hardening of your arteries, which further increases your risk of cardiovascular problems.\n\nObviously, binge drinking should be avoided in order to have healthy blood circulation.\n\nTypically, binge drinking happens in groups. So try to limit the time you spend with your friends who tend to be binge drinkers.\n\n2 \u2013 Sitting For Too Long, Especially With Bad Posture\n\nWhile a brief period of sitting here and there are natural, long periods of sitting day in and day out can seriously impact your health and shorten your life.\n\nExcessive sitting is bad for your back and is one of the causes of poor circulation.\n\nUnfortunately, most of us are sitting even more than ever because of computers. And with prolonged sitting, comes negative damage to your organs\n\nThe Heart \u2013 In a sitting position, blood flow slows down and muscles don\u2019t burn enough fat, which permits fatty acids to clog in the heart much faster.\n\nThe Pancreas \u2013 The body\u2019s ability to properly respond to insulin is badly affected by just one day of prolonged sitting. This leads the pancreas to produce more insulin, and this causes low energy & fat gain.\n\nColon health\u2013 Excessive sitting may ruin your colon health\n\nSo, how can you avoid sitting for too long?\u2026\n\nSet an alarm on your computer, watch or phone and stand up every 30-60 minutes. Move around, stretch, grab a glass of water or do something physical.\n\nIf possible, go outside for a quick 10-minute walk. Instead of sitting and talking on your cell phone, walk around. There are no cords, so you have no limits.\n\n3 \u2013 High Intake Of Salt\n\nA high intake of sodium is a more common cause of poor circulation. For clarity, I\u2019m referring to regular table salt or salt found in most packaged foods. Not so much with more \u201cnatural\u201d salts such as Himalayan or Celtic Sea Salt.\n\nSodium is a mineral and electrolyte that\u2019s crucial for your body to function well. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention2, around 90% of sodium you get comes from salt.\n\nSodium assists in controlling blood volume and blood pressure. However, your circulatory health may suffer if you get too much of it.\n\nA high sodium diet is linked to blood pressure problems. According to the CDC, if sodium rises, blood pressure rises too. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 recommends you limit salt intake to less than 2,300 milligrams/day.\n\nYou should not consume more than 1,500 milligrams daily if you\u2019re over the age of 50, African-American, or have health problems.\n\nProcessed foods and restaurant foods are full of salt. Don\u2019t eat these foods and you\u2019ll be able to avoid the majority of your salt intake.\n\nYou can also add in potassium-rich foods or supplements, to counteract and balance the sodium intake.\n\nSo to sum up \u2013 avoid binge drinking, and sitting for too long, and remember to cut down the intake of salt in your diet to improve your blood circulation.\n\nAdd in some daily exercise and the right supplements so you can support healthy blood flow, energy levels, and overall health.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://consumer.healthday.com/general-health-information-16/alcohol-abuse-news-12/even-in-young-adults-binge-drinking-may-harm-circulation-675676.html\n\nhttp://healthyeating.sfgate.com/salt-intake-affect-circulation-10760.html",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and poor blood flow and circulation is a MAJOR warning signs of health problems. And, what kind of health problem depends on the symptoms and cause of your poor circulation.\n\nTypically though, all roads lead to heart problems\u2026\n\nBasically, a major health problem for your HEART and/or your BRAIN!\n\nNow, in previous articles, I\u2019ve discussed the different CAUSES of poor blood flow, as well as various SOLUTIONS.\n\nHowever, as extremely important as it is for improving your blood flow, you FIRST need to know if you have poor circulation.\n\nSo, today\u2019s article will quickly cover the 15 scary warning signs that you have poor blood flow circulation \u2013 that you can\u2019t ignore.\n\nAnd I tell you this from personal experience because it\u2019s crippled my family members, including causing death \u2013 especially for people on my dad\u2019s side of the family.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started:\n\nTingling Sensations or Numbness In Your Extremities\n\nNow, this typically happens in your hands and feet, including your toes and fingers. This is very common for example, in those who are diabetic because the sugar eats away at the blood vessels and veins.\n\nAnd this happens more so as you get older.\n\nIt\u2019s basically a warning sign that your body is telling you, \u201chey, fix this because I\u2019m not getting the nutrients and anti-aging hormones to these areas and it\u2019s going to get worse over time\u201d\n\nSimilar to numbness, having cold extremities \u2026 such as your hands and feet, is another obvious sign of poor blood flow.\n\nMaybe in the winter, when you\u2019re outside in the cold, it\u2019s to be expected. But, not the rest of the year or when you\u2019re indoors.\n\nThis is because blood helps to heat up areas. In fact, this is one reason children are warmer than adults \u2013 they have healthy blood flow.\n\nThe skin is one of the first areas to show physical symptoms of poor circulation.\n\nDespite getting enough water, your skin may dry out.\n\nYour body starts to slow down and doesn\u2019t function as well as it should. The water that your body does have is directed elsewhere to counter the problem with circulation.\n\nSwelling of Your Feet & Hands\n\nOn the opposite end, you may also start to retain water in areas, so you don\u2019t see it on the surface of your skin\u2026 which results in swelling of your feet and hands.\n\nIn fact, this is extremely common with people who have poor circulation and you readily see this with older people and those who have high blood sugar levels.\n\nWhen your hands and feet don\u2019t get adequate amounts of oxygenated blood, you may also notice discoloration of the skin covering these parts of your body.\n\nIf you see that your extremities have taken on a blue- or purple-ish tone, you can be fairly certain that your circulatory system isn\u2019t functioning as it should.\n\nDecreased Memory & Cognition\n\nPeople don\u2019t realize that your brain requires a lot of blood flow, over 15% of cardiac (heart) output.\n\nIt\u2019s so vital that there\u2019s a name for it \u2013 Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF).\n\nAnd the LACK of blood flow can cause memory problems. One main reason is due to lack of oxygen.\n\nNot to mention, your brain is just basically working slower, and thus, you can\u2019t LEARN as well as you used to. You can\u2019t think as clearly.\n\nMany just call this \u201caging\u201d, but it\u2019s NOT. It\u2019s simply poor blood flow and lack of oxygen.\n\nAnd again, the cause can be a variety of reasons \u2013 hormones, neurotransmitters, heavy metal buildup, etc., etc.\n\nAgain, poor blood flow means a lack of oxygen and nutrients\u2026 which means your body isn\u2019t healing as well.\n\nDizzy Spells and Headaches\n\nDizzy spells are also extremely common.\n\nYour brain isn\u2019t getting the oxygen to keep it working efficiently. Even if you get plenty of water, you won\u2019t improve the dizziness.\n\nSome people also experience headaches on a regular basis because of the lack of circulation.\n\nNow, this is a less obvious symptom, but it\u2019s an even BIGGER problem.\n\nThis is because poor blood flow to your gut means poor digestion, which leads to malnutrition.\n\nAlso, your gut controls so many various hormones, your immune system, and even how well your brain works.\n\nLastly, this also SLOWS your metabolism.\n\nThis goes hand-in-hand with the loss of appetite and it\u2019s typically misdiagnosed\u2026 and that\u2019s why I bring it up.\n\nGas, bloat, bowel problems, and other digestive issues \u2026 are all symptoms.\n\nThis also is connected to digestive problems and lack of appetite.\n\nAgain, blood contains nutrients, including anti-aging hormones, that allow your body to cleanse and repair itself.\n\nWithout this, you keep getting sick and you\u2019re aging faster.\n\nEven though a decrease in libido has a lot to do with your hormones, poor blood flow is important because it means they lack key hormones and enzymes being delivered to this area \u2026\n\nIn men it\u2019s your penis and thus, erectile problems.\n\nIn women, it\u2019s lowered sensation, sensitivity, drive, dryness, etc.\n\nHair Loss, Brittle Hair & Nails\n\nAlso, due to the lack of nutrient-filled blood in your body\u2019s extremities, new growth of hair and nails may become weak and brittle.\n\nRemember, your blood ALSO contains hormones. So, fewer anti-aging hormones result in hair loss.\n\nPoor circulation can cause the veins just under the surface of the skin on your legs to become swollen, twisted, and very visible.\n\nThese blue and purple blemishes are known as varicose veins and in addition to being somewhat unsightly, they can also become itchy or even painful.\n\nTightening of Chest & Difficulty In Breathing\n\nWhen you have poor circulation, your heart doesn\u2019t get as much blood flow as it normally should.\n\nThis can cause you to feel tightening or increased pressure in your chest, shortness of breath, or difficulty in breathing \u2013 a symptom known as angina.\n\nYour poor circulation will start to affect your cardiovascular system if left untreated.\n\nFrequent Exhaustion or Lack of Energy\n\nWhen your circulatory system slows down, it no longer has the capacity to deliver oxygen, nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and more importantly, HORMONES throughout your body as it should.\n\nThis in turn will also slow down your metabolism.\n\nThere you have it \u2013 warning signs of poor blood flow & circulation.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing any of these warning signs, make sure you visit your doctor \u2026 more importantly, please make some improvements in your life, which will quickly improve your blood flow circulation.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also take specific vitamins, minerals & herbs that promote healthy blood flow.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

This is especially important for men who have erectile problems.\n\nDon\u2019t drink pomegranate juice because of the spike in blood sugar and insulin levels. It\u2019s all sugar.\n\nIt\u2019s better to eat the fruit, including the seeds \u2013 which contain the majority of the vitamins, fiber, and essential fats.\n\nOr if you want to save the calories or you just don\u2019t have the time or desire to peel and eat pomegranates, then I suggest you take the extract in pill form.\n\nMelons are very healthy and watermelon is extra healthy for your heart.\n\nA 2011 study by University of Kentucky researchers found that watermelon helps reduce the build-up of plaque in the arteries.\n\nIn addition, the amino acid L-citrulline found in watermelon helps support healthy blood pressure. It helps widen the blood vessels by stimulating nitric oxide production, which is how drugs like Viagra work indirectly.\n\nMoreover, watermelon helps modify blood lipids and lowers belly fat accumulation, which in turn reduces the risks associated with coronary artery plaque accumulation and heart problems.\n\nAvocados are a very interesting food. First, most people don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a fruit because it has a seed.\n\nYet, the majority of the calories come from fats and that\u2019s why I personally categorize avocados more as a FAT\u2026. even though technically it\u2019s a fruit and that\u2019s why it\u2019s mentioned in today\u2019s article.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a good, natural healthy fat, especially for your heart. It\u2019s primarily monounsaturated fat but does contain some polyunsaturated fats as well.\n\nA 1996 study done by researchers in Mexico found that people who ate avocado every day for one week experienced an average 17% drop in total blood cholesterol.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, their levels of LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol decreased and HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol increased.\n\nAnother benefit is that it also prevents blood sugar spikes, which is important for healthy circulation.\n\nIt contains vitamin E, which prevents cholesterol from oxidizing and also helps naturally thin the blood and thus, support healthy blood flow.\n\nIt\u2019s also high in potassium, which helps healthy blood pressure.\n\nImproving blood flow is extremely important for your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nTry to eat some pomegranates, watermelon, and/or avocados daily or at least 3x weekly.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Poor blood flow because of plaque buildup, inflammation, or thicker, stickier blood, can cause blood pressure problems, and lead to more serious heart problems.\n\nThis is why improving your blood flow in 2025 is a vital key to living a healthier, longer, and more youthful life.\n\nThis is because your blood contains oxygen, proteins, enzymes, youthful hormones, and other nutrients that will help heal and repair your body.\n\nAs an added bonus, increasing your blood flow can improve your skin, hair, memory, muscle size, and even your performance in bed.\n\nUnfortunately, the older we get, the worse our circulation becomes.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to reveal 3 spices that are clinically proven to help support healthy circulation & clean arteries.\n\nTurmeric For Healthy Circulation\n\nSpice turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that can help keep arteries free from any kind of blockage.\n\nIt contains curcumin, which supports a healthy inflammatory response, a major cause behind the hardening of your arteries.\n\nAccording to a 2009 study by French researchers, curcumin can help reduce fatty deposits in arteries by almost 26 percent.\n\nIt has vitamin B6 which is important in maintaining optimal homocysteine levels, which in excess causes plaque buildup and blood vessel damage.\n\nFinally, turmeric helps reduce cholesterol oxidation and \u201cbad\u201d LDL levels.\n\nGinger For Blood Flow\n\nGinger is amazing because it\u2019s a very powerful anti-inflammatory, similar to turmeric.\n\nIt is also a great alternative and substitute for aspirin, but without any side effects.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning. Ginger also:\n\nFights against the hardening of the arteries.\n\nInhibits abnormal platelet aggregation, which is a part of blood that can \u201cclump\u201d together and cause blood clotting.\n\nGinger can increase the contractile strength of the heart, making your heart stronger.\n\nYou can put ginger in tea, in soup, with fish, and in a healthy shake.1\n\nCinnamon For Healthy Circulation\n\nThis delicious spice can help support healthy cholesterol levels while clearing out plaque and preventing further build-up. Cinnamon is full of antioxidants that improve cardiovascular health by protecting blood from oxidation.\n\nAdditionally, cinnamon can help support healthy blood sugar and triglyceride levels. Both of which can cause plaque buildup and eat away at the arterial wall.\n\nSupporting healthy blood flow is extremely important for your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nAdding some turmeric, ginger, and cinnamon into your diet daily can help support healthy circulation and reduce plaque buildup.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3820061",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/how-to-avoid-reduce-and-erase-varicose-veins/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and few years ago, on my right leg, I saw something I was hoping I would never see \u2013 small spider veins, which would have probably eventually turned into bigger varicose veins, had I not taken action to fix it \u2013 which I\u2019ll be discussing today in a few minutes.\n\nAnd spider veins are basically a milder form. They\u2019re smaller. And may eventually turn into bigger varicose veins.\n\nWhy did this happen to me?\u2026 Because I\u2019m getting older and mostly due to my lame genetics.\n\nBoth my parents have varicose veins. Not that many, but they have them.\n\nBut I\u2019m bringing up this topic about varicose veins because:\n\nThey don\u2019t look good, especially if you\u2019re a woman and you want to show of your legs, like wearing skirts, dresses, and so forth. And they look worse if your skin is really white.\n\nThey are a sign of poor blood flow and pressure build-up, which can lead to \u201cvenous insufficiency\u201d. Thus, reducing blood flow throughout your body, especially to your heart.\n\nSo, whether it\u2019s for vanity or longevity, varicose veins are NOT good.\n\nAnd today I\u2019ll quickly discuss the cause and different solutions, so you can help prevent, reduce, and even erase varicose veins.\n\nI\u2019m going to tell you what I did because the good news is that my spider vein has decreased and thus, hasn\u2019t grown. Plus, I have nothing new \u2013 so it\u2019s all going in a positive direction.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Cause Of Varicose Veins?\n\nThe main cause of varicose veins is pressure and poor blood flow, which damages the vein walls and valves. Blood circulation to the heart is restricted and slowed down. This can cause the blood to build up in certain places and thus, the veins grow larger, and become distorted, resulting in varicose veins.\n\nOf course, genetics plays a key role in everything. But, other lifestyle factors can cause or trigger it.\n\nSitting or standing for long periods of time\n\nLifting heavy weights for many years\n\nblood pressure problems\n\nNot exercising or moving much\n\nBasically, anything that causes pressure and restricts blood flow.\n\nHow Can You Tell If You Have Varicose Veins?\n\nThe most obvious way to know if you have spider or varicose veins is to just look at your skin. Typically they come out in your lower body \u2013 such as your legs and calves.\n\nHemorrhoids are also a type of varicose vein that develops in the rectum.\n\nTypical signs and symptoms include:\n\nbulging, bluish veins;\n\na feeling of heaviness in the legs and feet;\n\nchanges in skin color;\n\nand nighttime leg cramps.\n\nHow To Prevent & Improve Varicose Veins, Naturally\n\nSo, let\u2019s say you have a family history of it like I do and you want to prevent varicose veins. Or, you have a couple and you want to reduce it and also prevent future ones, what should you do?\n\nLet me share simple solutions you can implement today and also what I did.\n\nExercise regularly and the best form would be brisk walks. All you need is 10-15 minutes, 2-3x daily. It\u2019s easy and can be done anywhere at any time.\n\nME: I started doing this myself. I do it before or after a meal.\n\nKeep your legs elevated whenever possible. This is hard to do, but taking breaks throughout the day for a few minutes and putting up your feet will help.\n\nME: I put a small pillow under my calves or knees in bed while sleeping. So, my legs were elevated all night long. It\u2019s also great for my lower back and herniated discs.\n\nDon\u2019t sit or stand for long periods. Every 30-60 minutes, go move around. Walk up some stairs. Do 10-20 bodyweight squats. Just move and get more blood flow.\n\nME: I used to sit for 2-3 hours at a time while working on a project. I now get up every 30 minutes or so, walk around, go outside, get a glass of water or something.\n\nWhen you sit, don\u2019t cross your legs. This is easy for men, but not always possible for women.\n\nWearing compression stockings/socks on your lower legs helps as well.\n\nLosing weight is very important. Being overweight puts pressure on your entire body.\n\nImprove your blood flow and circulation. You can take specific vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that are proven to improve circulation and thus, reducing the size and severity of varicose veins. There\u2019s more information about a list of the best vitamins and supplements for this, in the link below.\n\nME: I started taking Blood Flow Optimizer when this started. My parents have been taking it for over 10 years with great results. So, I started it as well. Within the first bottle, I noticed improvements \u2013 better pumps in the gym, erections, and mental clarity.\n\nSurgery & Medical Options\n\nLastly, you can do surgery, laser, or other medical options to help remove varicose veins. This is especially important if you have a lot of varicose veins, especially large ones.\n\nSclerotherapy \u2013 destroys varicose veins by injecting them with a solution called a sclerosant. The sclerosant scars the vein and causes it to collapse, forcing blood to reroute to healthier veins. Your body eventually destroys the veins and they disappear over time. This type of procedure is typically used to treat small varicose veins located close to the surface of the skin called \u201cspider veins\u201d and to improve the appearance of the leg.\n\nRadiofrequency and Laser Ablation \u2013 your doctor will numb the vein and use either radiofrequency or laser to \u201ckill\u201d the veins. This takes a few weeks or months before results are seen.\n\nHowever, even when you do one of these medical procedures, because of your genetics, new varicose veins will continue to come up as you age.\n\nSo we go back again to improving your lifestyle and utilizing the \u201cprevention\u201d tips I mentioned, to help avoid future spider and varicose veins\u2026 or to reduce them, as I did.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s all about improving your blood flow and circulation.\n\nAnd for more details about this topic, make sure you visit the special link that I have for you.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nMayo Clinic Staff.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/nattokinase-a-natural-secret-for-better-blood-flow-and-blood-pressure/",
    "content": "I received a question in 2025 regarding a very powerful nutrient called \u201cnattokinase\u201d \u2013 what I think about it, does it work, how to use it, what\u2019s the best form, and what the benefits are.\n\nIn Japan, there\u2019s a very popular, cheese-like, fermented soy product call Natto. They prepare it by boiling or steaming soybeans and then fermenting them with a specific bacterium \u2013 Bacillus subtilis natto.\n\nUnfortunately, Natto has a very sour aroma and most people don\u2019t like it. Certainly not in the US, which is a shame because it\u2019s probably one of the world\u2019s healthiest foods.\n\nNatto is a great source of a powerful nutrient called nattokinase \u2014 a type of enzyme that helps dissolve blood clots.1-3\n\nHow Nattokinase Works\n\nWhat most people don\u2019t know is that Nattokinase helps address one of the most overlooked problems in the development of heart disease and high blood pressure, which is hyperviscosity.\n\nIn plain words, that means thick, sick, sticky, and inflamed blood that moves slowly through the circulatory system.\n\nNature\u2019s Blood Thinner\n\nIn fact, Nattokinase is nature\u2019s very own natural blood thinner.\n\nIt helps support healthy blood flow, circulation, and blood pressure4-5 to every part of your body, so you can feel young and energized.\n\nHyperviscosity increases the inflammatory process that damages arteries.\n\nThe thicker your blood is, the harder your cardiovascular system has to work to squeeze and push the blood through your blood vessels. Over time, this can cause arteries to become calcified and less elastic.\n\nSluggish blood flow also increases the risk of clot formation. But the nattokinase reinforces the actions of plasmin, your body\u2019s own enzyme that breaks down the clotting agent called fibrin, thereby preventing abnormal thickening of the blood.\n\nDecreases Fibrin Buildup\n\nThus, another major benefit with nattokinase is that it fights Fibrin Buildup, which is an insoluble protein formed from fibrinogen during the clotting of blood. It forms a fibrous mesh that impedes the flow of blood (not what you want). This decreased blood flow leads to a feeling of fatigue and gets you tired more easily, slowly leading to heart failure and a heart attack.\n\nBest Type of Nattokinase\n\nBecause this is such a valuable and important nutrient, I did my research and discovered that Nattokinase NSK-SD\u00ae is the best form and type.\n\nThe NSK-SD\u00ae is the first nattokinase introduced into the US market, and it has established standardization and quality levels for all nattokinase, with comprehensive safety studies and proven potency.\n\nIt is vegetarian and Non-GMO. NSK-SD\u00ae has two Japanese and three U.S. patents and is recognized by the JHFA (Japan Health and Nutrition Food Authorization) and JNKA (Japan Nattokinase Association) as an authentic nattokinase. And every batch is tested to ensure potency.\n\nThis is what I use and I suggest taking about 200 mg daily.\n\nHowever, I also suggest you don\u2019t take it by itself. It\u2019s best utilized with other specific nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts which will help support healthy blood flow, circulation, and blood pressure, with increased safety and effectiveness.\n\nJust as there\u2019s no \u201cbest\u201d food or \u201cbest\u201d exercise, no SINGLE nutrient is the best either. It\u2019s all about the combination and ratios.\n\nI want you to visit a special page where I\u2019ve listed the best ingredients to use with Nattokinase and how you can copy the same formula in an \u2018all-in-one\u2019, easy-to-use pill.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096399690400242X\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4479826/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7784396\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18971533\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066864/",

    "content": "Did you know that the better your blood flow is, the healthier your body and the younger you look and feel?\n\nThis is because your blood contains oxygen, proteins, enzymes, youthful hormones, and other nutrients that will help heal and repair your body.\n\nUnfortunately, plaque buildup, or \u201cthicker blood,\u201d decreases circulation and can increase your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and of course, lead to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nAnd the older we get, the worse our circulation becomes.\n\nHowever, if you want to look and feel younger in 2025, and improve your skin, hair, memory, muscle size, and even your performance in bed, you must support healthy circulation.\n\nAnd today I\u2019m going to reveal the best fats that are clinically proven to help cleanse your arteries and support healthy blood flow.\n\nMonounsaturated Fats For Healthy Blood Flow\n\nMonounsaturated fats, more specifically extra virgin macadamia nut and olive oil, are great for your health. They support healthy blood flow and reduce the formation of varicose veins.\n\nMonounsaturated fats also help support healthy cholesterol levels, while improving HDL/LDL ratios.\n\nThey contain powerful antioxidants and olive oil also contains polyphenols \u2014 all of this helps healthy blood flow and arterial health.\n\nThese healthy fats also help dilate the veins and arteries, which helps healthy blood pressure.\n\nThe one thing to remember is that you should NOT cook with olive oil, it shouldn\u2019t be heated because it changes the structure of the fat. So, use it on top of salad or vegetables.\n\nHowever, you can cook with macadamia nut oil because it has a higher heat and smoke tolerance.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t suggest you cook with either \u2013 raw is best.\n\nBut you can cook with the next fat and that\u2019s:\n\nOne main benefit of extra virgin coconut oil is that you can cook with it because it\u2019s saturated fat. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not bad for your cholesterol. I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\nCoconut oil is very beneficial for healthy blood circulation. It has healthy fats and contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCT oil) that help relieve inflammation of the arteries. This, in turn, promotes healthy blood flow throughout the body.\n\nCoconut oil has many additional health benefits \u2013 it improves your metabolism, it\u2019s good for your brain and memory, boosts your immune system, reduces candida and yeast, is good for gut health, and is great for your skin and hair.\n\nNow, some people are afraid to eat this fat because it\u2019s primarily \u201csaturated\u201d fat, even though it has no cholesterol. The truth is that it increases your \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol.\n\nAnd yes, it does increase the \u201cbad\u201d LDL, but it increases the SIZE of them which is a good thing. Smaller, LDL particles are the real problem. So, never look at just \u201cLDL\u201d levels because there are different sizes and forms.\n\nNuts have lots of health benefits, especially almonds and walnuts. They consist of healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats which help support healthy cholesterol levels.\n\nAlmonds have magnesium, which helps relax your arteries.\n\nWalnuts are high in omega-3 fats, which support healthy inflammatory responses and help thin the blood.\n\nNuts also have carnitine, which plays an important role in brain and heart function.\n\nDo NOT roast your nuts because it changes the structure of the fat. Eat them raw.\n\nHealthy blood flow is extremely important for your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nYou need to reduce or eliminate unhealthy \u201cvegetable oils\u201d such as canola, corn, or the usual stuff on the supermarket shelves.\n\nThey are fake fats that have a very long shelf life, and worst of all, high in inflammatory omega-6 fats.\n\nInstead, have extra virgin macadamia nut, olive, and coconut oils. Throw in some raw almonds and walnuts as well.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 now and we know that garlic has a lot of health benefits, especially for the heart, and one of them is better circulation.\n\nUnfortunately, to get the real benefits, the way that it should be consumed will cause your body to smell.\n\nWhen you cook garlic, the smell is less \u2013 but the health benefits are mostly gone.\n\nHow Garlic Can Improve Blood Flow?\n\nGarlic and its sulfur compounds, more specifically allicin, can help improve better flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), an indicator of blood flow efficiency.\n\nIn a study in 42 people with coronary artery disease, those who consumed garlic powder tablets containing 1,200 mg of allicin EXTRACT, twice daily for three months experienced a 50% improvement in blood flow through the upper arm artery, compared to a placebo group. (1)\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the dosage, which was 2400 mg daily, and the fact it contained allicin EXTRACT, not the root powder which is worthless.\n\nAnd do NOT get \u201codorless\u201d garlic supplements, they won\u2019t work.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem, even the supplements that do work, will cause odor problems for most people.\n\nIf you still want to eat the actual garlic, it needs to be crushed or chopped to get the biologically active component. Let it sit in the air for at least 15-20 minutes before using. This is when the allicin expands and grows.\n\nOf course, garlic is not the only food or supplement that helps improve blood flow. There are about a dozen specific vitamins, herbs, and amino acids that when combined together, are far more powerful than garlic, with much faster results and ZERO smell.\n\nTake a look while it\u2019s fresh on your mind and let me know how they work for you and your circulation.\n\nDive Deeper: Garlic\u2019s Power for Your Heart\n\nIf you\u2019re curious to learn more about how garlic works its magic on your heart and blood vessels, you\u2019re in the right place. Let\u2019s peel back the layers!\n\nGarlic isn\u2019t just a kitchen staple; it\u2019s packed with a special ingredient called allicin.\n\nThis powerful compound is the hero behind garlic\u2019s ability to fight heart problems and keep your blood flowing smoothly.\n\nWhen you eat garlic, especially raw, allicin gets to work, helping your blood vessels relax. This makes it easier for blood to travel through your body, bringing oxygen and nutrients to where they\u2019re needed most.\n\nIn more detailed studies, like the one mentioned earlier, scientists have found that taking garlic supplements rich in allicin can significantly improve how well blood flows through your arteries.\n\nThis is especially important for people who have heart conditions or are at risk of developing them.\n\nBut, getting enough allicin through diet alone can be a challenge, especially if you\u2019re trying to avoid that famous garlic smell.\n\nThat\u2019s where high-quality supplements come into play. Remember, it\u2019s crucial to choose supplements that haven\u2019t been stripped of their smell, as those are the ones that retain the beneficial allicin.\n\nFor those willing to embrace the garlic life, here\u2019s a tip to maximize its benefits: after chopping or crushing your garlic, let it sit for about 15-20 minutes before you use it.\n\nThis waiting period allows the allicin to form fully, making sure you get the most heart-healthy bang for your buck.\n\nWhile garlic is a fantastic tool in your heart-health toolkit, it\u2019s not the only one.\n\nCombining garlic with a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can amplify its benefits.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about exercise!

Nails, hair, skin, muscle.\n\nFat? Fat actually is important since it\u2019s needed for hormone production. Some fats are good and some aren\u2019t. However, hormones don\u2019t always lead to better erections.\n\nCarbs? Researchers from Harvard monitored over 50,000 men over the course of 30 years and discovered is that the men who ate a specific type of carbohydrate had improved sexual function and were far LESS likely to suffer from any kind of erectile dysfunction.\n\nThese specific carbs contain polyphenols.\n\nWhat Are Polyphenols?\n\nPolyphenols are a category of plant compounds that offers various health benefits. They help:\n\nGood for brain & heart health\n\nSupport healthy blood sugar\n\nAnd most importantly, support healthy circulation\n\nAnd this last benefit, the healthy blood flow, is a primary reason for better and strong erections.\n\nBest Sources Of Polyphenols\n\nFruits, which are carbohydrates, are one of the best sources, such as:\n\nDarker the skin of the fruit, the higher the polyphenols.\n\nPolyphenol Supplements\n\nSupplements have the advantage of offering a consistent dose of polyphenols. However, they also have several potential drawbacks.\n\nFirst, supplements haven\u2019t been consistently shown to offer the same benefits as polyphenol-rich foods, and they don\u2019t contain any of the additional beneficial plant compounds typically found in whole foods.\n\nPolyphenols seem to work best when interacting with the many other nutrients naturally found in foods. It\u2019s currently unclear whether isolated polyphenols are as effective as those found in foods.\n\nFinally, polyphenol supplements aren\u2019t regulated, and many contain doses over 100 times larger than those in foods or sometimes just a fraction of what\u2019s found in the food. This creates a lot of imbalances.\n\nBesides, why not eat some tasty fruits?\n\nOf course, there are many other natural ways to support healthy, youthful blood flow and circulation.\n\nBut based on this large, 30-year study \u2013 polyphenols from specific, dark-skinned fruits are good for circulation, for your heart, brain, and penis.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5601283/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6160559//",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I believe this is an important article about anyone who is taking calcium, magnesium, Vitamin D3, and/or K2.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in improving blood flow & circulation\u2026 As well as:\n\ngaining muscle losing fat improving your memory sleeping better having stronger bones better circulation improving your hormones reducing muscle pain or cramping\n\nimproving your memory\n\nhaving stronger bones\n\nimproving your hormones\n\nreducing muscle pain or cramping\n\n\u2026and simply living a longer life with fewer illnesses and health problems, then please read today\u2019s article.\n\nImportant For Both Men & Women\n\nYes, this is a big promise, but it\u2019s true.\n\nThis is for both men and women and maybe even MORE so for women.\n\nI got asked an important question:\n\n\u201cDr. Robbins can you please clarify for me, how much calcium I am supposed to take daily? I keep hearing about how important calcium is. I am presently taking 1200mg of calcium Citrate in a liquid form plus Magnesium 400mg and vitamins K-2 and D3. Thank you!\u201d\n\nFirst, these are all important vitamins and minerals to take, so good job.\n\nSecondly, I can\u2019t tell you how much calcium you may need since there are too many factors and the only way to give you a specific answer is to do a blood test and see where your current levels are and IF you\u2019re deficient or by how much.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ll give some recommendations below\u2026\n\nNow, the problem is if you can\u2019t absorb the calcium, it can build up in your arteries over time and reduce blood flow, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\nHowever, let me give you some significant things to think about.\n\nFirst, you shouldn\u2019t be taking only calcium citrate. You should do a blend of different calcium, such as\n\nD-Glucarate (one of my favorites)\n\nIdeally, you\u2019ll probably need to mix and match a couple of different brands to get the mix, this is what I do.\n\nWith that said, you don\u2019t need any more calcium. 1200 mg is a good amount. The RDA recommends about 1,000 mg daily. 1,300 mg for older people over 60.\n\nHonestly, I tell my clients to take 600-800 mg daily and focus more on Magnesium\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s even more important is magnesium, something that most people are deficient in and need more of \u2013 especially women.\n\nI suggest taking at least the same mg dose as the calcium and maybe even double, especially for women.\n\nBut don\u2019t take it all at once or else you may get digestive issues. Start lower and build up.\n\nJust like calcium, take a blend\n\nGlycinate (one of my favorites)\n\nL-threonate (one of my favorites)\n\nTake about 75% of your magnesium around bedtime, to help you relax, sleep better, and reduce stress hormones.\n\nAnd take the other 25% of the dose around noon. These seem to be ideal times for absorption and utilization.\n\nYou can do this with the calcium as well, so you can remember to take them both at the same time.\n\nMy suggestion and something I do is take 600 mg of Magnesium Glycinate in the evening about about 400 mg in the middle of the day. For a total of 1,000 mg daily.\n\nYes, that may seem like a lot, but I have clients taking even more.\n\nNext is one of my favorite vitamins, Vitamin D3, and one that most people are deficient in (including myself).\n\nSo, here\u2019s something interesting. I HAD been taking 10,000 units DAILY for a few years\u2026 and yes, that high.\n\nI did a blood test and my levels were about 61 ng/mL. The range is between 30-100.\n\nMost people and doctors will say \u201cGreat, that\u2019s in the middle, you\u2019re good\u201d\n\nHowever, that is NOT optimal.\n\nI now take 20,000 units daily, Mon-Fri, which works out to about 15,000 units daily.\n\nI do this because I like to cycle this off, even if it\u2019s just 2 days weekly. You don\u2019t have to, it\u2019s just me since I\u2019m taking such a higher dose of fat-soluble vitamin.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a crazy high dose. But at this dose, my blood test level is now 93 ng/mL. I believe the very upper limit of the range, 30-100 is optimal.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s always best and ideal to do blood tests to remove all the guesswork.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that I should be getting a lot more sun to help absorb the D3 better and help my body produce it on its own, based on the amount of cholesterol I\u2019m also eating daily.\n\nBUT, I just don\u2019t make the time to go in the sun and have the UV rays hit my body daily for 20-30 min. I should, but I don\u2019t.\n\nSo, I supplement with extra Vitamin D3. Not the best move, but this is what I have to do for now because I\u2019m not getting enough sunlight.\n\nNow, for most people, I think 5,000 iu (125 mcg) daily is a good start. Then you do a blood test and increase as needed. Most will do better with double that dose.\n\nI\u2019ll share something interesting with you about magnesium and D3, as it pertains to calcium\u2026 and I\u2019ll tell you that in a minute.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s quickly talk about vitamin K.\n\nThis is an extremely important vitamin and I believe that in a few years, this will regularly be tested like D3 is these days.\n\nNeedless to say, if you\u2019re not taking this other important fat-soluble vitamin, please do so now. It helps absorb calcium into the BONES and not into the arteries.\n\nThe correct form of Vitamin K is K2 (Mk7 form). 50 mcg daily, up to 100 mcg.\n\nThe ideal ratio is Vitamin D3 5000 iu (125 mcg) + Vitamin K2 (MK7) 50 mcg. I use Perfect Vitamin D3 + K2.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the cool part\u2026\n\nWhen you take more magnesium and D3, you absorb more calcium.\n\nAnd vitamin K, especially K2-7 (Menaquinon MK7) helps take the calcium out of the blood and into the bones, where it should be.\n\nThis improves blood flow and helps reduce plaque and calcium buildup in your arteries and veins.\n\nThis combo also helps build stronger bones, improves your hormones, and helps with thousands of other extremely important health functions and helps slow down age-related health problems.\n\nSo, there you have it.\n\nCalcium is important, take a blend.\n\nAdd in magnesium. Glycinate is the one I use. Take most of it before bed to help relax you for better sleep.\n\nTake Vitamin D3 + K2 for the dozens of health benefits, and youthful hormonal production.\n\nAll of this helps promote healthy blood flow & circulation to your heart, brain, muscles, skin, hair and extremities (hands + feet).",

The best type of diet to follow is an anti-inflammatory and low insulin-stimulating/blood sugar diet.\n\nCarbs \u2013 Reducing Inflammation\n\n50% of your diet should come from low-glycemic, anti-inflammatory carbohydrates.\n\nThis is because high insulin levels due to high blood sugar from the WRONG forms of carbohydrates, cause plaque to build in the lining of your arteries.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with carbohydrates\u2026 You just want to eliminate or minimize sugars and simple carbs such as white bread, cereals, pasta, and most carbs that come in a \u201cbox\u201d.\n\nInstead, you want to eat more natural carbohydrates such as\n\nBuckwheat (contains NO wheat or gluten)\n\nProteins \u2013 Reducing Calcium Deposits\n\nLess than 25% should come from healthy proteins. Most people eat way too much protein, especially in America. It\u2019s not natural to eat so much protein.\n\nYour body doesn\u2019t require much protein and \u201chigh protein\u201d diets actually CAUSE plaque and calcium buildup in your arteries.\n\nThe best healthy proteins are:\n\nWild-caught fish (salmon is great)\n\nGrass-fed bison/buffalo\n\nFree-range eggs (including the yolks)\n\nSmall amounts of free-range chicken\n\nFats \u2013 Improving Blood Flow\n\n25% from healthy fats. Most people eat way too much of the WRONG fats and barely any healthy \u201cgood\u201d fats.\n\nStay away from hydrogenated oils and trans fats. Do NOT cook or heat your fats, other than maybe coconut, palm, or other \u201csaturated\u201d fats.\n\nStay away from most vegetable oils, especially the junk at the local supermarket. These are the WORST types of fats because they cause plaque buildup.\n\nOrganic, extra virgin coconut\n\nExtra virgin olive oil\n\nSeed oils (hemp, flax, etc.)\n\nRaw nuts (almonds & walnuts are great)\n\nLiquids \u2013 Do\u2019s & Don\u2019ts\n\nDon\u2019t drink your calories. Nothing with sugars. No sodas, even if they are \u201cno calories\u201d because they acidify your body and cause calcium deposits.\n\nYou also need to eliminate dairy. Milk is for babies and cow milk is for BABY COWS!\n\nDrink lots of water (lemon for taste), some green tea, and maybe 1-2 cups of organic coffee.\n\nPlaque and calcium building up in your arteries and heart are bad for your health because poor blood flow affects your entire body.\n\nKeep your diet as natural as possible, don\u2019t drink your calories, and stay hydrated with lots of clean water.\n\nCombined with the right exercises and supplement program, you\u2019ve assured healthy blood flow and circulation\u2026\n\nThis means better longevity and a dramatically reduced risk of having heart problems.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Imagine going for a walk and suddenly feeling pain or discomfort in your legs.\n\nOr if you\u2019re a man, you have sexual desire\u2026 but when you try to perform, things aren\u2019t working like they used to be.\n\nThis could be more than just old age, fatigue, or hormonal problems.\n\nThis might be a warning sign of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), a condition where blood flow to your lower body \u2013 such as legs, feet, and penis is reduced due to artery blockages.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the 6 warning signs of a potential blocked artery, so you know what to look out for and what actions to take if you notice these symptoms.\n\nNumber 6 is one that most guys never give any thought to, so make sure you listen to the end.\n\nRemember, early detection can make a huge difference because you can help make improvements, reverse this problem, and ultimately, help reduce your risk for a heart attack or stroke.\n\nI\u2019ll also give you easy-to-implement solutions.\n\n1. Leg Pain or Cramping During Activity\n\nWhat to Look For: If you\u2019re having pain, cramping, or heaviness in your legs when walking or climbing stairs, this is a warning sign.\n\nEspecially if the discomfort gets better when you rest.\n\nThis means something is preventing optimal circulation from your heart, down to your legs.\n\n2. Skin Color or Temperature Changes\n\nWhat to Look For: If one leg looks different than the other. For example, it looks paler, or bluish. Or it feels colder than the other leg.\n\nThis is caused by poor blood flow.\n\n3. Slow-Healing Wounds\n\nWhat to Look For: If you get cuts or sores on your legs or feet and it\u2019s taking longer to heal, this is due to poor blood flow.\n\nYour skin is not getting the nutrients from your blood, including youthful hormones \u2013 so healing has slowed down.\n\nThis is more prevalent in people who are diabetic and have high blood sugar levels.\n\nSo, make sure you do a blood test to see where your blood sugar and A1C levels are. I\u2019ll list more blood-sugar-specific solutions at the end of this video.\n\n4. Shiny, Hairless Skin on the Legs\n\nWhat to Look For: If you see unusual smoothness or loss of hair on your legs, this can be an indicator of poor circulation.\n\nNow, some men will get that \u201chairless\u201d area around their calves because of socks. That\u2019s normal and it\u2019s usually in both legs.\n\nHowever, if you see one leg more shiny and hairless than the other, this could be a sign of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and poor circulation.\n\n5. Numbness or Weakness in Legs\n\nWhat to Look For: Numbness, tingling, or a feeling of heaviness in your legs that doesn\u2019t go away with rest.\n\nPersistent numbness or weakness is another sign of poor blood flow.\n\n6. Erectile Dysfunction in Men\n\nWhat to Look For: In men, there can be many causes for erectile dysfunction.\n\nHormones such as low testosterone or high estrogen are primary factors.\n\nHowever, poor blood flow is a major issue and this is typically a secondary factor.\n\nIn fact, erectile dysfunction is a pre-warning sign of potential heart and brain problems \u2013 such as a heart attack or stroke.\n\nFor hard erections, you want optimal testosterone and youthful hormonal balance, PLUS improved blood flow.\n\nThe two work together.\n\nHaving one of these signs doesn\u2019t mean you have Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD).\n\nBut if you have 2 or more signs, it\u2019s worth checking out and taking action.\n\nEspecially because you know that the older you get, the worse the problem will be.\n\nEarly treatment can prevent serious complications like heart attacks, strokes, or even losing a limb.\n\nMaintain a Healthy Lifestyle: Eat well, stay active, maintain a healthy weight, and don\u2019t smoke.\n\nRegular Medical Check-ups: Routine visits can help catch problems early.\n\nRemember, poor blood flow to your extremities \u2013 such as your legs, feet, hands and yes, your penis is a warning sign of poor circulation, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve listed the best ways of improving your blood flow, naturally.\n\nTake a look while it\u2019s fresh on your mind and take action. This can all be improved when you do something about it.\n\nBut, it\u2019ll be too late if you have a heart attack or stroke.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

But one that he was shocked about was he had major kidney problems.\n\nAnd this is a BIG problem because your kidneys filter toxins and control circulation in the body.\n\nA weak kidney is like having dirty blood running through your veins all day long.\n\nIt\u2019s very toxic and only gets worse unless you do something about it the right way.\n\nKeep in mind, that once your kidneys stop working, you die.\n\nYour kidneys detox your body and work with your liver. However, the liver can regenerate and improve \u2013 your kidneys seem to only get weaker as you age.\n\nHigh blood pressure, blood sugar and so many other body functions are related to your kidneys.\n\nMany drugs go through both the kidneys and the liver. When you take Tylenol, that damages your kidneys.\n\nScary Stats About Kidneys\n\nChronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects about 40 million adults in the US, which is about 15% of the population or 1 in 7 adults.\n\nNow, this is a full-blown kidney disease.\n\nThis does NOT take into account the millions of people with weak kidneys who will eventually have kidney disease or kidney failure if they don\u2019t take action.\n\nDiabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney disease, which accounts for 75% of chronic kidney disease cases.\n\nSadly, 1 in 3 adults have diabetes and 2 in 3 people have high blood sugar.\n\n1 in 4 adults have high blood pressure.\n\nIn both situations, people don\u2019t even know they have these problems.\n\nAll of these issues basically reduce blood flow and circulation, which negatively affects all of your organs, your brain, energy levels, muscle, and even sexual performance.\n\nI mention all of this to let you know that kidney problems are very serious and yet, something most people don\u2019t talk about.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s talk about solutions for improving your kidneys.\n\nLet\u2019s first start with the 7 best foods with clinical studies supporting healthy kidney function.\n\nA study published in Nutrients showed that blueberry consumption can benefit kidney health by reducing the burden on the organ\u2019s filtering process.\n\nBlueberries are high in antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins, which help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidneys. The anti-inflammatory properties can reduce damage to the kidney tissues.\n\nPlease eat whole blueberries, not the juice because it\u2019s high in sugar. And since it\u2019s thin skin, better to eat organic when possible.\n\nResearch from The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition indicates that regular consumption of cranberry products can significantly reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs and also support kidney health.\n\nSimilar to blueberries and other fruits, eat the whole fruit \u2013 not the juice which is too high in sugar, which then increases blood sugar and stresses your organs, such as your kidneys.\n\nA study in Phytomedicine found that eating raw garlic or consuming garlic supplements can decrease inflammation and oxidative stress, reducing the risk of kidney damage in hypertensive patients.\n\nGarlic can cause bad breath, so taking the supplement form would probably be a better option.\n\nResearch published in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research highlights the role of cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower in reducing kidney inflammation and improving detoxification pathways in the kidneys.\n\nAccording to research in Nutrition & Metabolism, the monounsaturated fats in olive oil can help decrease inflammation in Chronic Kidney Disease CKD patients, improving kidney function markers.\n\nFatty Fish (e.g., Salmon)\n\nA study in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology highlighted that omega-3 supplementation can reduce proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) and lower blood pressure in patients with kidney disease\n\nSalmon is a really good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Now, if you don\u2019t like salmon or fatty fish, then you should supplement with 2-4 grams of fish oil daily.\n\nA study in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine found that pumpkin seeds may help decrease the risk of forming kidney stones due to their high magnesium content.\n\nI also suggest supplementing with extra magnesium for most people. It\u2019s a vital mineral that most of us are deficient in.\n\nMagnesium has dozens of health benefits, one of them is lowering blood pressure and reducing kidney stones.\n\nBased on human clinical studies, these were some of the best foods that support healthy kidney function.\n\nNow, I also want to give you some very powerful supplements to consider since it\u2019s easier for most people to take a supplement, rather than make big diet changes.\n\nI already mentioned fish oil and magnesium.\n\nAn herb called Astragalus is very effective at improving kidney function. I have a lot of my athlete clients taking this, especially those who lift weights and take performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids.\n\nHowever, you need a high dose. At least 3-5 grams daily. So, don\u2019t bother with the liquid drops. Even the capsules are going to get very expensive.\n\nI would get the powder, it\u2019s a lot cheaper. I then put half a tablespoon in my protein shakes every day.\n\nMy Favorite Solutions\n\nOne of the biggest stressors on your kidneys is high blood pressure.\n\nMy family and I take Blood Pressure Optimizer because it contains all the clinically researched ingredients in one pill.\n\nAlso, you want to improve blood flow. As we get older, circulation gets worse as I stated earlier.\n\nFor that, I take Blood FLOW Optimizer.\n\nI combine the two and the results are much better together.\n\nHowever, you should get the one you think your body needs.\n\nPlease don\u2019t just passively listen to my words. Take action because your organs, especially your kidney are very important to every aspect of your health.\n\nImplement some of the foods I mentioned today and add in the supplements for additional benefits and improvements.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "If you didn\u2019t already know, healthy blood flow & circulation is crucial for health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nYour blood contains all the nutrients you need to live.\n\nPoor blood flow negatively affects your:\n\nall of your organs, such as your heart, kidneys, and liver\n\nit\u2019s bad for how you look \u2013 your muscles, fat loss, skin, and hair.\n\nAnd yes, poor blood flow causes negative sexual performance \u2013 especially for men.\n\nAnd the worst part about all of this is the older we get, the worst the blood flow.\n\nNow, I bring this up because I was at dinner a few nights ago and everyone was drinking wine and some other alcoholic drinks. I was the only one who wasn\u2019t\u2026\n\nAnd a couple of people who don\u2019t know me asked why I don\u2019t drink?\u2026 I gave them an honest, but politically correct answer, which was \u201cI don\u2019t really like the taste or the extra calories\u2026 it doesn\u2019t do much for me anyway.\u201d\n\nThen a couple of people said, \u201cbut alcohol is good for your heart and circulation\u201d. Then one of the wine drinkers chimed in and said, \u201cyeah, especially red wine, it has resveratrol\u201d.\n\nNow if this was 10 years ago, I would have argued and said otherwise. I would have said how you\u2019d need to drink like 10 bottles of wine to get a tiny amount of resveratrol.\n\nBut now that I\u2019m older and wiser, I don\u2019t say anything because I\u2019m not going to try and change someone\u2019s mind. It doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s a waste of my time and it creates negative energy.\n\nIf you want to drink wine, go for it. But please don\u2019t justify it by trying to say it\u2019s healthy for you.\n\nDoes Alcohol Really Help With Blood Flow?\n\nHowever, does alcohol really help with blood flow? What do the science and clinical studies say?\n\nWell, looking over lots of different studies, the basic conclusion is that one small drink of either red wine or alcohol can have a very slight benefit for the heart and blood vessels.\n\nBut as soon as you consume two drinks, the positives disappear and a lot more negatives happen.\n\nYes, alcohol can help thin the blood and prevent blood cells from sticking together or clotting.\n\nWhile the blood thinning properties of alcohol may lower the risk of certain types of strokes, they can also increase the risk of strokes that involve bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic strokes).\n\nThe reality is that alcohol is a toxin to the body.\n\nIt\u2019s bad for your liver and yes, kidneys as well. Both of these organs are very important for healthy blood flow.\n\nAlcohol also increases blood sugar and causes inflammation. Both of which are bad for your health, blood pressure, and circulation.\n\nI know guys will drink alcohol to relax or use it as \u201cliquid courage\u201d to interact with women, but it\u2019s horrible for your sexual performance and reduces blood flow to the penis.\n\nAlcohol also decreases sexual sensation and the ability to achieve an orgasm for both men and women.\n\nAlcohol is also very bad for your mitochondria, which plays an important role in almost every function in the body, including blood flow.\n\nAnyway, the bottom line is that alcohol is not good for you.\n\nIf you want to justify it for a healthier heart or blood flow, stick to no more than one small cup daily. That\u2019s about 6 oz\n\nHowever, if you do enjoy drinking alcohol, then take supplements that actually DO improve your blood flow & circulation, to help undo the damage from the alcohol.\n\nThen you can have your alcohol and enjoy it too.\n\nThere are a couple of vitamins, minerals, and herbs, which are proven to help support healthy blood flow & circulation.\n\nTake them daily and try not to drink more than 2 glasses of alcohol a day.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Calcium has many benefits and it\u2019s a very important mineral, especially in your BONES\u2026\n\nBut NOT in your arteries and heart.\n\nIn fact, calcium deposits and plaque buildup is a sign of early aging because they reduce blood flow & circulation.\n\nSo you really need to be proactive and reverse and remove calcium and plaque buildup:\n\nFor anti-aging purposes\n\nFor healthy blood flow & circulation\n\nTo help reduce your risk of heart problems.\n\nAnd the good news is that no matter how old you are or how \u201cbad\u201d things may seem in your arteries, you can DEFINITELY help reverse and remove calcium and plaque buildup\u2026 quickly and easily.\n\nAnd you can do it naturally, without drugs or crazy restrictive diets.\n\nI\u2019ve done it over and over again with hundreds and thousands of my clients, including my father!\n\nToday I\u2019m going to focus on the 2 best forms of exercise for removing calcium and plaque buildup.\n\nThis is because these days, we\u2019re sitting all the time and thus, you really need to do some form of exercise.\n\nA combination of aerobic and anaerobic is best.\n\nAerobic means \u201cwith oxygen\u201d and things like walking, jogging, playing sports, dancing, swimming, and so forth are all great.\n\nI think walking is great and you don\u2019t need much to start. Even 15-20 minutes, 3x weekly is great. The goal is at least 30 minutes, 3x weekly.\n\nAnd if you have pain or trouble walking, even 3 minutes is a good start. Try your best to walk just a little bit MORE every single day, so you can build up your strength and stamina.\n\nAnother great aerobic exercise is using a rebounder, which is basically a mini-trampoline.\n\nI like this because it is very low impact and super easy on your joints.\n\nIt also helps clean your lymph nodes, which helps prevent many health problems.\n\nI put mine in front of the TV while watching a favorite show and do it for about 10-20 minutes daily. You don\u2019t need much at all.\n\nBy the way, you\u2019re not trying to jump high on it and try to touch the ceiling. You only need to go up a few inches. Just enough for your toes to be off the rebounder. It\u2019s just a light up and down motion.\n\nAgain, almost anyone can do it, anytime and anyplace. You can even travel with it.\n\nIn addition to aerobic exercise, you should also do anaerobic.\n\nAnaerobic means \u201cwithout oxygen\u201d and this is mainly \u201cresistance exercise\u201d and lifting weights.\n\nThis can be with dumbbells and barbells, cables, machines, or even your own body weight.\n\nLifting weights has even MORE benefits than aerobics because it improves your hormones and increases calcium buildup in your BONES, where they should be.\n\nThe more muscle and heavier weights you lift, the stronger your bones \u2026 which is what we all need as we age.\n\nPlaque and calcium building up in your arteries and heart are bad for your health because poor blood flow affects your entire body.\n\nThe best exercise for improved circulation is a combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercise.\n\nYou can do it daily or 3x a week. The goal is to stay active and slowly build your strength and stamina.\n\nCombined with the right diet and supplements, you\u2019ve assured healthy blood flow and circulation\u2026 This means better longevity and a reduced risk of having heart & brain problems.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/7-foods-that-can-prevent-blood-clots-clinically-proven/",
    "content": "None of us wants to have a heart attack or stroke \u2013 which are the leading causes of death in 2025 and for over 100+ years around the world, for both men and women.\n\nSo if we want to live a longer and healthier life and avoid getting a heart attack or stroke, we need to reduce blood clots, decrease plaque build-up and improve blood flow & circulation.\n\nToday I\u2019ll quickly go over the 7 best foods that are clinically proven to help achieve these goals.\n\nFatty Fish (Salmon, Mackerel, Sardines)\n\nWhy: Fatty fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, which have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nAnother benefit to fish oil is that they help reduce blood clotting by lowering the levels of clotting factors like fibrinogen and reducing platelet aggregation.\n\nLastly, they help thin the blood, which helps circulation.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like eating fish, you should consider taking fish oil pills. I suggest between 2-4 grams daily. I personally take 6 daily.\n\nWhy: Garlic contains allicin, which has anticoagulant properties. It helps reduce platelet aggregation and enhances fibrinolysis, the process that dissolves blood clots.\n\nOne problem with garlic is that it does make your body and breath smell.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t want to eat garlic, you can take garlic extract in a pill form. Make sure it contains the Allicin extract in the formula.\n\nWhy: The active compound in turmeric is curcumin. It has a strong anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties. Curcumin inhibits the action of clotting factors and reduces platelet aggregation.\n\nYou can cook with turmeric spice, but you\u2019d need a high dose of it.\n\nAlternatively, you can get turmeric extract in a pill form. Make sure it\u2019s 95% extract. I\u2019ve listed the supplements I take below.\n\nWhy: Ginger contains compounds like gingerol that have natural anticoagulant properties. It helps prevent platelet aggregation and can reduce the risk of blood clot formation.\n\nI like the taste of ginger, but I don\u2019t eat it much \u2013 other than with my sushi.\n\nYou can also take ginger extract in a pill form. Make sure it\u2019s 15% extract or higher.\n\nWhy: Cayenne pepper is rich in capsaicin, which can help improve circulation, and has mild anticoagulant properties that reduce the risk of clot formation.\n\nWhen I was younger, I would put cayenne pepper on a lot of my foods. But, as I got older my stomach couldn\u2019t handle it as well.\n\nI can\u2019t even take the cayenne extract in pill form either. It\u2019s too acidic for my stomach.\n\nDark Leafy Greens (Kale, Spinach)\n\nWhy: These greens are rich in vitamin K, which plays a complex role in blood clotting. While vitamin K is essential for normal clotting, it also helps regulate clotting by preventing excessive clot formation when consumed in balanced amounts.\n\nDark leafy greens have a lot of benefits. Make a salad out of them daily.\n\nHowever, you do have to consume a very large amount to get enough Vitamin K.\n\nThis is why I supplement Vitamin K2 daily. It\u2019s part of a blood flow support supplement I take daily.\n\nBerries (Strawberries, Blueberries, Cranberries)\n\nWhy: Berries are high in antioxidants, particularly flavonoids, which have been shown to reduce platelet aggregation and improve blood vessel function.\n\nThin skin berries also have polyphenols which help with your blood vessels.\n\nTypically, the darker the skin, the higher the polyphenols.\n\nPlease don\u2019t drink the juice. Eat the actual fruit. You can also get them frozen if they are out of season.\n\nSo these are the 7 best foods that are clinically proven to help reduce blood clots &, decrease plaque build-up. Try to incorporate at least one of them into your daily diet.\n\nThe big picture goal is to improve blood flow & circulation while reducing inflammation.\n\nThis is very important for your heart and brain.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nHarris, W.S., & Mozaffarian, D.

    "content": "If you ever get swollen feet or legs, then you should watch this important video because this swelling can be a warning sign of severe health issues related to your heart, brain, muscles, kidneys, liver, and other vital organs.\n\nAs we age, blood flow & circulation decrease.\n\nAt the same time, swelling \u2013 also known as edema increases.\n\nEdema is the medical term for water retention, which happens when excess fluid builds in your tissues.\n\nThis can typically be seen in your feet, ankles, and legs because gravity pulls the water down.\n\nWhen your body is healthy and has youthful blood flow and circulation, your body will push the water back up and down and thus, there won\u2019t be this water build-up and swelling.\n\nThis Edema is bad for a variety of reasons.\n\nThis could mean that your body\u2019s lymphatic system isn\u2019t functioning properly. This means bacteria and waste will build up in your body. This has been linked to cancer.\n\nEdema can also mean that you have high blood pressure and thus, your kidneys aren\u2019t functioning properly.\n\nUnlike your liver which can regenerate, your kidneys can\u2019t. This can lead to kidney failure.\n\nSpeaking of the liver, Edema is also linked to liver damage. This is why alcoholics typically have a lot of edema because they have weak livers.\n\nAnother problem with edema is that it\u2019s linked to high blood sugar levels, which can lead to diabetes.\n\nEdema is also linked to high stress levels and an increase in stress hormones such as cortisol.\n\nWhen cortisol levels are high, your youth hormones dramatically decline \u2013 such as testosterone, estrogen, and growth hormone.\n\nObviously this is bad because it accelerates aging.\n\nAt the same time, as cortisol levels increase, so does insulin and blood sugar levels.\n\nAll of this can lead to weight gain.\n\nWhich then leads to more edema.\n\nAs you can see, it\u2019s not a simple problem of \u201cmy feet and legs are swollen because I\u2019m just retaining water\u201d\n\nThis is a clear sign that your body is not functioning properly \u2013 things are breaking down and you\u2019re dying much faster.\n\nCauses Of Edema & Poor Blood Flow\n\nThere are many causes of edema and poor blood flow.\n\nSuch as lack of exercise, sitting or standing too long, poor diet, weight gain, unhealthy organs, poor sleep and so forth.\n\nI\u2019ll make a more detailed video about these lifestyle factors in a future video.\n\nHowever, today\u2019s focus will be on nutrients you can take, to help reduce the swelling in your legs, ankles, and feet. While also improving your blood flow.\n\nNutrients To Reduce Edema\n\nPotassium is a mineral that acts as a diuretic and thus, reduces fluid retention. It opposes sodium which is salt.\n\nMost people have a diet high in salt because they eat a lot of processed foods and used condiments, which are all super high in sodium.\n\nAt the same time, most people eat very little foods that are high in potassium, so there\u2019s a big imbalance in these electrolyte minerals.\n\nAlso, if you get foot cramps, that can be due to a lack of potassium in your diet\u2026 Which is something my mom had dealt with.\n\nYou should focus on eating foods higher in potassium, such as leafy green vegetables and root vegetables such as potatoes.\n\nTry to reduce your sodium intake as well.\n\nAnd make sure you\u2019re drinking plenty of water.\n\nYou can also take a potassium supplement. They come in 99 mg pills. Take 1 \u2013 3 daily.\n\nVitamin D has so many benefits. Vitamin D is technically not a vitamin, but a hormone \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s so powerful.\n\nMost of us are deficient or have sub-optimal vitamin D levels.\n\nThis includes myself, who is outside in the sun daily \u2013 which is where vitamin D is made from \u2013 sunlight.\n\nSo, I suggest taking a vitamin D supplement. Take Vitamin D3 and take it with K2 to balance out these two essential vitamins.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed most people do well with 2000-5000 units of vitamin D3 daily, combined with K2. Some need as many as 10,000 units.\n\nI personally take 5000 in the summer and 10000 in the winter.\n\nThere are specific nutrients \u2013 such as herbs, vitamins, and amino acids that help improve blood flow and circulation.\n\nThey also help strengthen your arteries and capillaries and make them more pliable and flexible.\n\nYou can take a product called Blood Flow Optimizer that has all of these ingredients, including Vitamin D3 & K2\n\nThis is what my parents and I have been taking for about 20 years.\n\nOne veggie pill does it all. Simple, easy, and convenient.\n\nThese are the 3 best supplemental nutrients for improving blood flow and reducing swelling.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ll give you an extra bonus and that\u2019s Vitamin C\n\nI love Vitamin C because it has so many health benefits. It\u2019s good for your skin, hair, collagen, immune system, brain, heart, muscles, and yes, blood flow and swelling.\n\nMost people aren\u2019t getting enough Vitamin C in my opinion.\n\nYes, about 100 mg is 100% of the RDA to prevent scurvy, but that\u2019s not our goal today.\n\nWe want optimal levels of vitamin C\n\nIt\u2019s found mainly in citrus fruits. However, you\u2019ll never get an adequate amount of fruits or vegetables. Nor do I suggest drinking fruit juice, which is all sugar.\n\nI suggest taking 500 mg of Vitamin C, 3x daily with food.\n\nI personally take 3,000-5,000 mg daily. I know it\u2019s high for many people.\n\nBut, I almost never get sick and I know this is a big reason for it.\n\nThese are the 3 best solutions in my opinion. There are lots of other things you can take \u2013 such as lowering inflammation, taking fish oil, magnesium and so forth.\n\nBut I\u2019ve listed the most important ones since most people don\u2019t want to be taking a handful of pills daily.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget \u2013 you still need to improve your lifestyle\u2026\n\nThe simplest thing is to lose weight and walk at least an hour a day. I walk 20 min, 3x daily. First thing in the morning and the other 2 times are after a meal.\n\nAnyone can walk, so please don\u2019t make excuses.\n\nSo, please take action on what you\u2019ve discovered today because edema and swelling on your legs and feet is a massive warning sign that your body is very unhealthy.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

    "content": "As I\u2019ve stated in the past, proper blood flow and circulation is a massive part of good health. Unfortunately, as we age, plaque and calcium build up in our arteries and veins, while at the same time, we also lose elasticity, flexibility, and pliability in our arteries.\n\nBlood pressure problems\n\nHeart health problems\n\nMuscle loss, hair loss, and wrinkles\n\nPoor blood flow to extremities (hands, feet, and penis)\n\nAnd a host of other health problems.\n\nI\u2019ll post a link to another article about a natural option that I\u2019ve used myself and my parents over the past decade to help fix these problems.\n\nHowever, today I want to quickly give you 3 super simple solutions to help naturally support blood vessel elasticity, which will help support healthy blood flow, while also helping avoid heart problems in the future.\n\nOf course, exercise plays a huge part in strengthening your arteries and veins. You need to do BOTH:\n\nAnaerobic resistance exercise (weight lifting \u2013 cables, dumbbells, machines, etc.)\n\nAerobic cardiovascular exercise (walking and rebounding are best, swimming, jogging, etc.)\n\nI suggest 20-40 minutes each. You can do them on alternate days \u2013 such as weights 4x weekly and cardio 3x weekly on your off days.\n\nI do think weight lifting and building new muscles are far more important than cardio.\n\nBTW, just walking even 20 min 3x weekly, is a great start.\n\nWhat you put in your body certainly affects how your blood looks and the cells behave.\n\nAgain, let\u2019s keep this very simple. You don\u2019t need to try any fad diets, like ketogenic or intermittent fasting, high or low carbs, so on and so forth.\n\nJust keep things as natural as possible.\n\nProtein \u2013 healthy protein sources would be wild-caught salmon being the best, small amounts of grass-fed bison, pasture-raised whole eggs, and maybe chicken. Vegetarian protein is great. Stay away from dairy.\n\nFat \u2013 most people eat too many of the wrong fats and not enough of the good ones. Eat more omega fats from fish, extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nut oil, Udo\u2019s Oil, avocados, and small amounts of MCT oil and nuts such as walnuts. NO peanuts or cashews. Stay away from all other so-called healthy fats \u2013 such as soybean, corn, sunflower, and cottonseed \u2013 all of which are found in packaged foods.\n\nCarbs \u2013 yes, please eat carbs. I\u2019m so tired of people being carb-phobic. Eat natural carbs like vegetables, fruits, legumes, and small amounts of white rice and healthy bread like Ezekiel and sprouted bread. Just stay away from all other packaged carbs.\n\nYes, this is limited, but it\u2019s very simple, and do your best to follow this most of the time. Here\u2019s a link to food that is good for you.\n\nSpecific Nutrients \u2013 Vitamins, Minerals & Herbs\n\nAnd let\u2019s face it, almost nobody is eating the most perfect diet, which consists of foods they grew on an organic farm, on rich soil, cooked properly, and so forth.\n\nSo, these days, you MUST supplement your diet with extra nutrients. The best for improving your blood flow and arterial elasticity is:\n\nFish Oil: pills or from wild salmon\n\nVitamins: C, D3, E, K, and Magnesium\n\nSpecific Amino Acids: N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC), different L-Carnitines (Acetyl, GPLC, and Fumarate)\n\nHerbs: Ginger, Green Tea, Resveratrol, Grapeseed, and White Willow\n\nThere are a few other nutrients and I\u2019ll give you the specific link for more details on these supplements, the best forms, dosages, and so forth \u2013 you can get all the details here in this special link.\n\nAs stated, your blood flow and arterial elasticity, and flexibility basically control how you\u2019re aging. It\u2019s one of the most important factors.\n\nSo many of the wrong things you do in life \u2013 like getting fat, smoking, stress, high sugars, drugs, and so forth ALL negatively affect your blood flow and arterial flexibility.\n\nPlease make sure you take action today and make some small adjustments and improvements in your life by just eating a little better, exercising more consistently, and taking some key supplements that will make huge and fast improvements in your circulation and arterial flexibility.\n\nAs with everything in life, it\u2019s all about GETTING STARTED and staying consistent. Any small improvement daily will lead to MASSIVE progress over the next few months and years.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

No drugs. No diet changes either.\n\n\u201cIs My Blood Pressure TOO Low?\u201d\n\nYesterday I got a very important question from Max and he asks:\n\nHow low is \u201ctoo low\u201d for blood pressure? Mine is about 105/55. My doctor said that could be too low, but I feel fine. What do you think Dr. Sam? Should I be worried?\u201d\n\nAs long as you are not feeling dizzy or passing out or feeling weak\u2026 then it is okay to have that level of blood pressure.\n\nThere are a lot of \u201cnormal\u201d people walking around with even lower blood pressures of 90/50\u2026 on no medication and it is just normal for them.\n\nThe only time doctors \u201cshould\u201d treat low blood pressure is when there are symptoms, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, muscle weakness, fatigue, or the experience of passing out.\n\nAny of these could result in a bad fall or you passing out while driving \u2013 all things we don\u2019t want to happen.\n\nSo, low blood pressure is fine.\n\nUnlike \u201chigh blood pressure problems\u201d, which can kill you in an instant and is why it\u2019s called \u201cthe silent killer\u201d.\n\nNow, this is a very interesting topic for me because I have a family history of blood pressure problems, especially on my dad\u2019s side.\n\nWhen I was doing research on how to support my dad\u2019s blood pressure naturally, I discovered that the lower your blood pressure, the healthier you are.\n\nThis is even MORE important as we age because blood pressure rises as we get older, even on a very good diet and healthy lifestyle.\n\nBy keeping your blood pressure below 120/80, you could:\n\nReduce premature death by 27%1\n\nLower your risk for cardiovascular accidents and heart problems by 43%2\n\nWhat\u2019s even more fascinating is that a detailed analysis of 18 clinical studies of almost \u00bd a million people (498,561 people)3, revealed that people with PRE-condition had a\n\n55% increased risk of cardiovascular problems,\n\n50% increased risk of coronary heart problems,\n\nListen carefully \u2013 I said, PRE condition, which is a systolic level of 140 mmHg. Regular \u201cblood pressure problems\u201d are over 160 mmHg.\n\nThus, the typical person walking around, labeled as having \u201cblood pressure\u201d is even WORSE off.\n\nAnyway, the point here is you MUST support healthy blood pressure if you want to live longer and feel better.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nSprint Research Group, Wright JT, Jr., Williamson JD, et al.

    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from Sophia and she asks:\n\n\u201cAre there any exercises for healthy circulation to my legs? I have varicose veins and also pain in my legs, which is much worse at night. They are very restless at times and it\u2019s hard to sleep.\u201d\n\nI completely understand because my mom has had similar leg pains, but no varicose veins. Actually, my dad has varicose veins in the family.\n\nToday I\u2019ll quickly discuss the 3 best exercises for healthy blood flow and circulation to your legs and your entire body.\n\nYou can do them anywhere and anytime, regardless of your age or fitness level.\n\nAnd it will not cost you anything!\n\nPrimary Causes Of Heart Problems\n\nPoor blood flow and circulation are one of the primary causes of heart problems.\n\nThis is because it can lead to:\n\nProblems in blood pressure regulation\n\nHardening and narrowing of your arteries\n\nUnhealthy cholesterol levels and plaque build-up\n\nIn fact, poor circulation can be a very dangerous condition because it increases the risk that blood will gather in your veins and lead to a life-threatening blood clot.\n\nI\u2019m very familiar with this topic because I have a family history of heart problems, which affected my own father just a couple of years ago.\n\nSo this is very important for me to share some simple and easy solutions for you, so we can help reduce any health complications for you.\n\nSome of the \u201cwarning signs\u201d that you may have circulation problems include\n\nFrequent pain and cramping in your legs\n\nTingling or numbness in your feet\n\nTired, aching, or weak legs and feet\n\nVaricose and \u201cspider\u201d veins\n\nWhy Circulation Is So Important\n\nNow, improving circulation to your legs is very important because you have to pump the blood uphill to your heart\u2026 going against gravity!\n\nWhen you walk, your foot and leg muscles are contracting and relaxing and basically acting like a \u201csecond heart\u201d, to continually pump blood back up through your legs and to your heart.\n\nUnfortunately, if you are sedentary for prolonged periods of time \u2026 like sitting for too long, on a long flight, or bedridden\u2026\n\nYour \u201csecond heart\u201d is inactive and blood can gather in your veins and around your ankles and this can lead to pain in the lower legs\u2026\n\nAnd the worst-case scenario it can lead to a life-threatening blood clot.\n\nThe good news is that by performing regular leg exercises, you can promote healthy blood flow from your legs to your heart and thus, help prevent blood clots and leg pain.\n\nExercises For Healthy Blood Flow & Circulation\n\nI think walking is one of the best exercises you can do and almost anyone can do it, anywhere, any time of the day and it doesn\u2019t cost you anything.\n\nIdeally, you would walk outside in fresh air if possible.\n\nFirst thing in the morning and/or late evening are good times but, whenever you can is better than nothing.\n\nTo start, all you need is about 15 minutes, 3x weekly.\n\nIdeally, you would work up to daily walks of about 30 minutes. And if you have pain or trouble walking, even 3 minutes is a good start.\n\nTry your best to walk just a little bit every single day.\n\nA rebounder is basically a mini-trampoline.\n\nI like this because it is very low impact and super easy on your joints.\n\nIt also helps clean your lymph nodes, which helps prevent many health problems.\n\nI put mine in front of the TV while watching a favorite show and do it for about 10-20 minutes daily. You don\u2019t need much at all.\n\nBy the way, you\u2019re not trying to jump high on it and try to touch the ceiling.\n\nYou only need to go up a few inches. Just enough for your toes to be off the rebounder. It\u2019s just a light up and down motion.\n\nAgain, almost anyone can do it, anytime and anyplace. You can even travel with it.\n\nThis last exercise is great for building and strengthening your entire lower body \u2026 From your ankles to your leg muscles and all the way to your lower back and stomach.\n\nYou can simply use your own body weight and do sets of about 15-20 repetitions.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re first starting out, simply doing even 2-3 comfortable repetitions is a great start.\n\nGo down as far as you are comfortable and without pain.\n\nOver time, as you get stronger and more flexible, you can do more repetitions and go deeper. Ideally, you would do maybe 1 set of 15 or more repetitions, 2-3x daily.\n\nMaybe in the morning, noon and night time.\n\nMore often and throughout the day helps keep the blood flow regular and continuous. And if you don\u2019t have good coordination, simply hold onto a wall or something sturdy as you squat down.\n\nPoor blood flow is bad for your health because it negatively affects your entire body.\n\nThe best exercises for healthy circulation, especially to your legs are:\n\nDaily and more often is best. For example, 5-10 min, 3x a day is better than 30 minutes, once a day.\n\nHowever, whatever you can do, whenever you can is better than nothing.\n\nOf course, you should get the \u201cokay\u201d from your doctor before starting any exercise program. But use common sense and start slowly and build up every week \u2013 intensity, duration, and frequency.\n\nAnd if you want to speed up the results, you can take special vitamins & herbs to help promote healthy blood flow & circulation from the INSIDE.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "Using Tenex for Anxiety | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness-se/using-tenex-for-anxiety/",
    "content": "In addition to using natural products and physical methods for relieving the effects of anxiety on the body, there are also prescription medications that can be used effectively as well. However, many of these medications have unwanted side effects or are very expensive to purchase.\n\nHowever, Tenex is a prescribed medication that offers fewer side effects and is relatively inexpensive compared to other types of medicines. Tenex is currently being prescribed to a growing number of people who suffer from prolonged anxiety because of its beneficial effects.\n\nAlso known as guanfacine, tenex is a drug that slows down the nerve impulses located in your heart and blood vessels. The effect is one that lowers blood pressure and improves overall circulation. Tenex is used to treat high blood pressure or hypertension and because of its mild effects is often complimented by other blood pressure medications.\n\nIt was during its treatment of hypertension that the effects on reducing anxiety were noticed. In addition, tenex is used in children who have displayed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well. The effectiveness of tenex is such that many people use it for anxiety relief.\n\nHow Tenex Reduces Anxiety\n\nBy lowering the blood pressure while increasing overall circulation, the effect of tenex is to relax the body and tamp down some of the effects created by anxiety. Those who take tenex as prescribed will often have the following positive effects:\n\n\u2013 Lower Stress Levels \u2013 Better Control of Emotions \u2013 Improved Sleep\n\nIn studies, it was shown that tenex also produces some very mild side effects in a small number of people, but for the most part tenex offered reduced stress levels that helped patients sleep better. Even those who suffer from post traumatic stress syndrome have fewer nightmares while using tenex, although there is currently no evidence that it reduces stress levels overall.\n\nAlthough relatively mild in nature, tenex is not for everyone. This is especially true if you are allergic to guanfacine as the reaction can be quite severe. In addition, those who suffer from coronary artery disease, kidney or liver disease and low blood pressure should not take this product as well. Basically, people who have heart conditions should stay away from tenex.\n\nAnother important factor is mixing tenex with other drugs or medications. Here, informing your doctor is paramount before taking tenex as an unwanted side effect from the mix can occur. This also includes any natural products that are being taken as well. For those who are on tenex, consult with your doctor before adding anything new or making major changes to your diet.\n\nOverall, tenex offers an interesting indirect path towards relieving the effects of anxiety.

    "content": "Having healthy blood flow & circulation is one of the most important factors for a healthy body AND mind.\n\nBlood flow affects your heart, brain, muscles, organs, skin, hair and yes \u2013 even sexual performance.\n\nI think healthy blood flow is more important than cholesterol and blood pressure levels. After all, high cholesterol or blood pressure problems are all due to poor blood flow.\n\nBut first, let me reveal the top 10 \u201cartery cleansing\u201d foods you should be eating every day.\n\nI\u2019ve listed them in alphabetical order:\n\nAll vegetables are great for your health, but asparagus is especially good for arterial health and improved blood flow.\n\nAsparagus boosts glutathione levels, which helps reduce inflammation and oxidation.\n\nAsparagus is also high in folic acid, which reduces the hardening of your arteries.\n\nAsparagus is also a natural diuretic, so it helps lower blood pressure levels.\n\nAvocados are a very interesting food. First, most people don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a fruit because it has a seed.\n\nYet, the majority of the calories come from fats and that\u2019s why I personally categorize avocados as a FAT.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a good, natural healthy fat, especially for your heart.\n\nA 1996 study done by researchers in Mexico found that people who ate avocado every day for one week experienced an average 17% drop in total blood cholesterol.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, their levels of LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol decreased and HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol increased.\n\nAnother benefit is that it also reduces blood sugar spikes, which is important for healthy circulation.\n\nIt contains vitamin E, which prevents cholesterol from oxidizing.\n\nIt\u2019s also high in potassium, which helps lower blood pressure.\n\nMake sure you eat lots of healthy fats.\n\nCoconut oil is great, despite the incorrect myth that it\u2019s bad for you because it\u2019s a saturated fat. It does NOT raise cholesterol. The lauric acid in it improves blood coagulation and is a potent antioxidant in your bloodstream.\n\nEating raw, organic seeds is great \u2013 such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and similar.\n\nMacadamia nut oil is great because it\u2019s high in monounsaturated fat, more so than extra virgin olive oil. And it\u2019s very stable, enough that you can cook with it.\n\nGarlic has many health benefits.\n\nBut as far as artery-cleansing benefits, researchers found that regular intake of garlic may help prevent hardening of the aorta, which is the main artery of the body, supplying oxygenated blood to the circulatory system.\n\nGarlic also helps reduce the \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.\n\nYou want to eat between 2-4 cloves of RAW garlic each day to get the benefits.\n\nKeep in mind that cooking destroys many of the health benefits.\n\nUnfortunately, your body will smell eating the raw garlic \u2013 your mouth, skin, hair, and sweat.\n\nGarlic supplements will have the same \u201csmelly\u201d effects. And \u201codorless\u201d garlic supplements don\u2019t work.\n\nThis is why garlic isn\u2019t one of my favorite foods, but it does have many clinically proven health benefits.\n\nGinger is amazing because it\u2019s a very powerful anti-inflammatory, similar to turmeric.\n\nGinger is also a great alternative and substitute for aspirin but without any of the side effects.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning. Ginger also\u2026\n\nFights against the hardening of the arteries.\n\nInhibits abnormal platelet aggregation, which is a part of blood that can \u201cclump\u201d together and cause blood clotting.\n\nGinger can increase the contractile strength of the heart, making your heart stronger\n\nYou can put ginger in tea, in soup, with fish, and in a healthy shake.\n\nNuts have lots of health benefits, especially almonds and walnuts.\n\nThey consist of healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats which help improve your cholesterol levels.\n\nAlmonds have magnesium, which helps relax your arteries.\n\nWalnuts are high in omega-3 fats, like fish.\n\nNuts also have carnitine, which plays an important role in brain and heart function.\n\nDo NOT roast your nuts because it changes the structure of the fat. Eat them raw.\n\nPomegranates are super high in antioxidants (vitamin C and polyphenols found in wine).\n\nIt also stimulates Nitric Oxide levels, which helps open your arteries and improve blood flow.\n\nDon\u2019t drink pomegranate juice because of the spike in blood sugar and insulin levels. It\u2019s better to eat the fruit or take Pomegranate Extract.\n\nSalmon is one of the best fish you can eat for overall health, especially for your heart and arteries.\n\nThis is because salmon is high in omega fish oils \u2013 DHA and EPA.\n\nIt helps increase your \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol, while also decreasing inflammation \u2013 which is key for improved blood flow.\n\nMake sure your salmon is \u201cwild caught\u201d and not farm-raised. Baked or grilled, but not fried.\n\nThe spice turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that can help keep arteries free from any kind of blockage.\n\nIt contains curcumin, which lowers inflammation, a major cause behind the hardening of your arteries.\n\nAccording to a 2009 study by French researchers, curcumin can help reduce fatty deposits in arteries by almost 26 percent.\n\nIt has vitamin B6 which is important in maintaining optimal homocysteine levels, which in excess causes plaque buildup and blood vessel damage.\n\nFinally, turmeric helps reduce cholesterol oxidation and \u201cbad\u201d LDL levels.\n\nMelons are very healthy and watermelon is extra healthy for your heart.\n\nA 2011 study by University of Kentucky researchers found that watermelon helps reduce the buildup of plaque in the arteries.\n\nIn addition, the amino acid L-citrulline found in watermelon helps lower blood pressure.\n\nIt helps widen the blood vessels by stimulating nitric oxide production.\n\nMoreover, watermelon helps modify blood lipids and lowers belly fat accumulation, which in turn reduces the risks associated with coronary artery plaque accumulation, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/102/13/4896.long\n\nhttp://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_4-9-2009-15-8-42\n\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/content/106/11/1327.full\n\nhttp://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=3054\n\nhttp://news.osu.edu/news/1998/01/27/garlic/\n\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111027125153.htm",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/new-study-is-eating-cheese-the-secret-to-living-longer/",
    "content": "So I got an email asking about a recent study1 that showed how eating cheese might be the secret to living longer.\n\nI\u2019ll simplify the study\u2026\n\n21 different countries\n\nBetween the age of 35-70 years old\n\nSeparated into 2 groups \u2013 reduced-fat dairy and full-fat dairy\n\nThe research concluded that \u201ceating more than two servings a day of processed cow milk was conducive to seeing some major decreases in not only your risk of heart problems but for risk of cardiovascular disease as well.\u201d\n\nBut, in my opinion, this is all total nonsense. So, let me quickly dig a little deeper.\n\nThe study showed that people, \u201cwho consumed the most whole-fat dairy, 3.2 servings per day on average, had lower mortality rates at 3.3 percent from the baseline and a 3.7 percent risk of developing cardiovascular disease. But those who ate less than 0.5 servings of dairy had a risk of cardiovascular disease at 5 percent.\u201d\n\nSo, in plain English, this means:\n\nHaving full-fat dairy reduced mortality or death, compared to those who had NO dairy \u2014 by 0.5%\u2026 yes, that\u2019s HALF of 1%\n\nThose who had barely any dairy, HALF a serving daily, had a higher cardiovascular risk by 1.3% than NON-dairy eaters. YUP, that\u2019s a little over just 1%\n\nSo, as you can see, this is all meaningless.\n\nAdditionally, the bigger takeaway here is that FULL-fat dairy is the common denominator to cardiovascular health and thus, a HIGHER fat consumption.\n\nWhat Does This Result Mean Exactly?\n\nThis means that with higher fat, you have better blood sugar control, which is the REAL key to living longer.\n\nThis is why ketogenic diets or intermittent fasting are healthy \u2013 mainly due to better blood sugar levels and improved insulin sensitivity.\n\nAnd there are simple ways to achieve these goals and I\u2019ll tell you in a minute.\n\nThe other issue I have is that dairy has lots of negative health concerns.\n\nMOST dairy comes from animals and cows that are NOT healthy. They are full of drugs, hormones, and antibiotics and live unhealthy lifestyles. They are fed unhealthy diets, NOT grass-fed or pasture-raised.\n\nTHUS, they are unhealthy animals, and that all goes directly into the milk and then into you.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s not only about the animals you eat, but more so \u2013 about what the animals ate as well.\n\nAn unhealthy animal means unhealthy meat which means that unhealthiness goes directly into your mouth and in your body and makes YOU unhealthy.\n\nWhen it comes to food \u2013 like most things in life \u2013 it\u2019s about QUALITY and not \u201cquantity\u201d.\n\nLastly, as I\u2019ve stated in previous articles and seminars, MILK is for babies. And COW milk is for BABY cows.\n\nWe are the only animal who continues to consume dairy well into adulthood. AND, we consume the diary of OTHER animals. None of this makes sense, right?\n\nNO other animal does this. It\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not natural.\n\nYes, dairy tastes great. I LOVE butter and cheese. I mean, anything tastes better with butter and cheese, right? Pizza is my favorite food. I can eat it any time of the day, hot or cold.\n\nBut, dairy should NOT be consumed and certainly not daily.\n\nSo, What\u2019s The Real Key To Living Longer?\n\nWhat\u2019s important here is that you eat plenty of healthy fats and manage your blood sugar levels, which is the REAL key to living a longer and healthier life.\n\nNow I have 2 important links I want you to click and visit.\n\nThe first is a natural option that my family and I have used since 2001, to help support healthy blood sugar levels naturally. No diet or exercise.\n\nAnd the second is 10 clinically proven ways to support healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nTake a look at both, right now, while it\u2019s fresh on your mind and dramatically improve your health by improving your blood sugar levels.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31812-9/fulltext",

    "content": "Calcium has many benefits and it\u2019s a very important mineral, especially in your BONES\u2026 But NOT in your arteries and heart.\n\nIn fact, calcium deposits and plaque buildup are signs of early aging.\n\nSo you really need to be proactive and reverse and remove calcium and plaque buildup\n\nFor anti-aging purposes\n\nFor healthy blood flow and circulation\n\nTo help reduce your risk of a heart problems.\n\nAnd the good news is that no matter how old you are or how \u201cbad\u201d things may seem in your arteries, you can DEFINITELY help reverse and remove calcium and plaque buildup.\n\nAnd you can do it naturally, without drugs or crazy restrictive diets.\n\nI\u2019ve done it over and over again with hundreds and thousands of my clients, including my father!\n\nSo let\u2019s get started with the 3 best ways to reverse and remove plaque buildup.\n\nExercise Can Remove Plaque Buildup In Your Arteries\n\nThese days, we don\u2019t move very much. We are sitting all the time and thus, you really need to do some form of exercise. A combination of aerobic and anaerobic is best.\n\nAerobic means \u201cwith oxygen\u201d and things like walking, jogging, playing sports, dancing, swimming, and so forth are all great. You don\u2019t need much to start. Even 15-20 minutes, 3x weekly is great. The goal is at least 30 minutes, 3x weekly.\n\nAnaerobic means \u201cwithout oxygen\u201d and this is mainly \u201cresistances exercise\u201d and lifting weights. This can be with dumbbells and barbells, cables, machines or even your own body weight. Lifting weights has even MORE benefits than aerobics because it improves your hormones and increases calcium buildup in your BONES, where it should be.\n\nThe more muscle and heavier weights you lift, the stronger your bones \u2026 which is what we all need as we age.\n\nHow Diet Can Remove Calcium Deposits In Your Arteries?\n\nYou need to improve your diet and I\u2019ll keep is simple. You want an anti-inflammatory and low insulin-stimulating/blood sugar diet.\n\n50% of your diet should come from low glycemic, anti-inflammatory carbohydrates.\n\nBuckwheat (contains NO wheat or gluten)\n\n25% should come from healthy proteins\n\nWild-caught fish (salmon is great)\n\nGrass-fed bison/buffalo\n\nFree-range eggs (including the yolks)\n\nSmall amounts of free-range chicken\n\n25% from healthy fats\n\nOrganic, extra virgin coconut\n\nExtra virgin olive oil\n\nRaw nuts (almonds & walnuts are great)\n\nDon\u2019t drink your calories and eliminate dairy.\n\nHerbs & Vitamins For Removing Plaque Buildup In Your Arteries\n\nThere\u2019s no way you can get all of your vitamins and minerals from food unless you ate thousands of calories daily.\n\nAnd when it comes to plaque and calcium removal, there are some very specific, potent, and effective supplements that will give you dramatic results in just a few short weeks.\n\nVitamin C, D3, E, and especially K2-7 (MK7) and Magnesium are very important at removing calcium OUT of your arteries and putting it in your bones where it belongs\n\nNattokinase reduces Fibrin buildup, which is an insoluble protein that impedes blood flow and thickens your blood.\n\nWhite Willow Extract and Ginger Extract are anti-inflammatory and also reduce thick, sticky blood and improve circulation. They work great together.\n\nNAC reduces heavy metals, toxins, and pesticides from your body and also strengthens your liver\u2026 all of which are very important for healthy and clean circulation of your blood.\n\nThere are a few other good ingredients specific to our goal \u2014 such as green tea extract and a blend of L-Carnitine (Acetyl + Glycine Propionyl)\n\nOf course, I\u2019m not expecting or advising you to go out and buy all of these ingredients individually and take them daily because it\u2019s just way too expensive and inconvenient.\n\nI know from personal experience because I tried it myself and with my parents.\n\nIt\u2019s not a long-term solution and if you don\u2019t stick to something long-term, you won\u2019t get lasting results.\n\nThat\u2019s why I like to simplify my life and use easy proven and effective solutions, which eliminate the need to take all of these ingredients by themselves.\n\nTry it now, it\u2019s easy and it\u2019s what I do myself.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

I don\u2019t want to take drugs, they have too many negatives.\u201d\n\nThis is an important question because poor circulation isn\u2019t a \u201ccondition\u201d itself. It\u2019s the result of OTHER health issues.\n\nPoor blood flow and circulation are one of the primary causes of a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThis is because it can lead to\n\nBlood pressure problems\n\nHardening and narrowing of your arteries\n\nCholesterol and plaque build-up\n\nThe good news is that this can be reversed and avoided naturally, without prescription medications, crazy diets or strenuous exercise programs.\n\nIn order to get the fastest results, we need to first AVOID some common situations that cause poor circulation and then make small lifestyle changes that will dramatically IMPROVE your blood flow.\n\n[1] If you smoke cigarettes, you must stop.\n\n[2] You need to eliminate or reduce simple carbohydrates and sugars because they increase your blood sugar and insulin levels and that deteriorates the lining of your blood vessels over time.\n\n[3] Have healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\nWhen both of these are high, blood flow is dramatically reduced, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.\n\n[4] Avoid long periods of immobility.If you\u2019re sitting behind the computer or desk or sofa all day long, you need to get up and move every hour or so.\n\n[5] Avoid hydrogenated and unhealthy fats.\n\nThese are cooked fats and oils, usually found in processed foods, which cause inflammation and thus, reduced blood flow. These include most of the \u201cseed\u201d or \u201cvegetable\u201d oils.\n\n[1] Drink more water because it dilutes your blood and improves circulation. Most of us are dehydrated and don\u2019t drink enough water.\n\nYou should drink at least half your body weight in ounces. So if you weigh 150 lbs, drink 75 oz daily.\n\nAdd in some lemon juice for taste. It also helps reduce acidity and inflammation.\n\n[2] You need to move more often.\n\nAny form of daily exercise is great. Lifting weights is the best. Dancing, going in the pool, playing sports, etc. are all great.\n\nAnd the simplest and easiest is daily walking. The goal is 20-30 minutes of daily working. But even starting with 10-15 minutes, 3x a week is a great start.\n\n[4] If you can afford to get a massage, that would be great.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a relationship, maybe you can get your significant other to give you the occasional massage.\n\n[5] Elevating your legs and hanging upside down on an inversion board is also very beneficial.\n\n[6] Finally, there are supplements that contain specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals that are scientifically shown to help promote healthy circulation and blood flow.\n\nMost people start with a supplement because it\u2019s easy, convenient and the results are quick.\n\nYou can find out more about the best ingredients and the exact formula that my family and I use to promote healthy blood flow.\n\nRemember, poor blood flow is the result of OTHER health issues, which can lead or a heart attack or stroke if you don\u2019t make improvements right away.\n\nSimple carbohydrates and sugars.\n\nBlood pressure problems and cholesterol.\n\nLong periods of non-movement.\n\nHydrogenated & unhealthy cooked fats.\n\nYou want to make improvements by:\n\nMove more often and exercise daily.\n\nElevate your feet and hang upside down.\n\nTake specific herbs, vitamins and minerals.\n\nMaking slight improvements in each of these will give dramatic positive results, much faster and with less effort.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/10-best-foods-for-cleaner-arteries-circulation/",
    "content": "Most people take for granted just how important healthy blood flow & circulation is. Having open, clean arteries affects every aspect of your body \u2013 your brain, heart, organs, muscles, energy levels, mood, and yes, sexual performance as well.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that as we get older, our arteries start to get a little narrower, weaker, and less pliable, and ultimately, circulation suffers and blood flow isn\u2019t as good as it used to be.\n\nJust remember, your blood contains everything you need to live \u2013 oxygen, hormones, nutrients, and so forth.\n\nIn many ways, I consider healthy blood circulation more important than cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. By the way, when these three are elevated, they all decrease blood flow.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to reveal my top 10 favorites, and clinically proven \u201cartery cleansing\u201d foods you should consider eating daily.\n\nAll vegetables are great for your health, but asparagus is especially good for arterial health and improved blood flow.\n\nAsparagus boosts glutathione levels, which helps reduce inflammation and oxidation.\n\nAsparagus is also high in folic acid, which reduces the hardening of your arteries.\n\nAsparagus is also a natural diuretic, so it helps lower blood pressure levels.\n\nAvocados are a very interesting food. First, most people don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a fruit because it has a seed.\n\nYet, the majority of the calories come from fats and that\u2019s why I personally categorize avocados as FAT.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a good, natural healthy fat, especially for your heart.\n\nA 1996 study done by researchers in Mexico found that people who ate avocado every day for one week experienced an average 17% drop in total blood cholesterol.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, their levels of LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol decreased and HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol increased.\n\nAnother benefit is that it also reduces blood sugar spikes, which is important for healthy circulation.\n\nIt contains vitamin E, which prevents cholesterol from oxidizing and helps thin the blood. It\u2019s also high in potassium, which helps lower blood pressure.\n\nMake sure you eat some healthy fats.\n\nCoconut oil is great, despite the incorrect myth that it\u2019s bad for you because it\u2019s saturated fat. It does NOT raise cholesterol. The lauric acid in it improves blood coagulation and is a potent antioxidant in your bloodstream.\n\nEating raw, organic seeds is great \u2013 such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and similar.\n\nBoth Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Macadamia nut oil are great because they\u2019re high in monounsaturated fats. Olive oil has the added benefits of polyphenols.\n\nGarlic has many health benefits. But as far as artery-cleansing benefits, researchers found that regular intake of garlic may help prevent the hardening of the aorta, which is the main artery of the body, supplying oxygenated blood to the circulatory system.\n\nGarlic also helps reduce the \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.\n\nYou want to eat between 2-4 cloves of RAW garlic each day to get the benefits.\n\nKeep in mind that cooking destroys many of the health benefits.\n\nUnfortunately, your body will smell eating the raw garlic \u2013 your mouth, skin, hair, and your sweat.\n\nGarlic supplements will have the same \u201csmelly\u201d effects. And \u201codorless\u201d garlic supplements don\u2019t work.\n\nSo this is why garlic isn\u2019t one of my favorite foods, but it does have many clinically proven health benefits.\n\nGinger is amazing because it\u2019s a very powerful anti-inflammatory, similar to turmeric.\n\nGinger is also a great alternative and substitute for aspirin, but without side effects.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning. Ginger also\u2026\n\nFights against atherosclerosis, which is the hardening of the arteries.\n\nInhibits abnormal platelet aggregation, which is a part of blood that can \u201cclump\u201d together and cause blood clotting.\n\nGinger can increase the contractile strength of the heart, making your heart stronger\n\nYou can put ginger in tea, in soup, with fish, and in a healthy shake.\n\nNuts have lots of health benefits, especially almonds and walnuts. They consist of healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats which help improve your cholesterol levels.\n\nAlmonds have magnesium, which helps relax your arteries.\n\nWalnuts are high in omega-3 fats, like fish.\n\nNuts also have carnitine, which plays an important role in brain and heart function.\n\nBut do NOT roast your nuts because it changes the structure of the fat. Eat them raw.\n\nPomegranates are super high in antioxidants (vitamin C and polyphenols found in wine).\n\nIt also stimulates Nitric Oxide levels, which helps open your arteries and improve blood flow.\n\nDon\u2019t drink pomegranate juice because of the spike in blood sugar and insulin levels. It\u2019s better to eat the fruit or take Pomegranate Extract.\n\nSalmon is one of the best fish you can eat for overall health, especially for your heart and arteries.\n\nThis is because salmon is high in omega fish oils \u2013 DHA and EPA.\n\nIt helps increase your \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol, while also decreasing inflammation \u2013 which is key for improved blood flow.\n\nMake sure your salmon is \u201cwild caught\u201d and not farm raised. Baked or grilled, but not fried.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t like salmon, try to take some fish oil in pill form. 2-4 grams daily is good.\n\nSpice turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that can help keep arteries free from any kind of blockage.\n\nIt contains curcumin, which lowers inflammation, a major cause behind the hardening of your arteries.\n\nAccording to a 2009 study by French researchers, curcumin can help reduce fatty deposits in arteries by almost 26 percent.\n\nIt also has vitamin B6, which is important in maintaining optimal homocysteine levels, which in excess causes plaque buildup and blood vessel damage.\n\nFinally, turmeric helps reduce cholesterol oxidation and \u201cbad\u201d LDL levels.\n\nMelons are very healthy and watermelon is extra healthy for your heart.\n\nA 2011 study by University of Kentucky researchers found that watermelon helps reduce atherosclerosis (buildup of plaque in the arteries).\n\nIn addition, the amino acid L-citrulline found in watermelon helps lower blood pressure. It helps widen the blood vessels by stimulating nitric oxide production.\n\nMoreover, watermelon helps modify blood lipids and lowers belly fat accumulation, which in turn reduces the risks associated with coronary artery plaque accumulation and heart disease.\n\nTry to add in as many of these foods as you can. And please be patient, it takes time to repair, and cleanse your arteries.\n\nIf you want to speed up the results and promote healthy blood flow even faster with less effort, you can also take specific vitamins.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "One of the biggest problems with having heart failure is you may not have or feel any symptoms. Or if you do, you may just ignore them and think it\u2019s because you\u2019re getting older.\n\nAnd this is why I wanted to do a short article today, to reveal 5 important warning signs and potential symptoms \u2026 So you can help avoid a heart problems.\n\nWhether your own or maybe someone near you, like a family member, a friend, or even a stranger.\n\nIn part two of this article series, I\u2019ll also reveal 5 simple ways for you to decrease the symptoms, strengthen your heart, and improve this situation so you can live a longer and healthier life.\n\nWhat Is Heart Failure?\n\nBefore I get started, heart failure occurs when something has damaged your heart muscles or there\u2019s a reduction in your heart\u2019s ability to pump effectively and do its job.\n\nThis is typically from coronary artery disease, which is basically a buildup of plaque in the blood vessels and thus, limits blood flow and circulation \u2014 which is the main problem with all of this.\n\nHowever, this can also be caused by genetics or a faulty heart valve, as was the case with Arnold Schwarzenegger and his mom as well.\n\nBlood pressure is also a major issue, as is blood sugar Both of which reduce correct blood flow and circulation.\n\nNow, to keep things simple and memorable for you, I\u2019ll quickly give you a 5 letter acronym to help you remember the 5 warning signs of heart failure, which are called: FACES.\n\nF = Fatigue. You\u2019ll feel more tired or fatigued because the heart isn\u2019t able to pump enough oxygen-rich blood that your body and brain need.\n\nA = Activity limitation. People with heart failure are often unable to do their normal activities because they become easily tired and short of breath. And since this happens more so in people after the age of 60, they typically dismiss this warning sign and think it\u2019s \u201cold age\u201d.\n\nC = Congestion. Fluid buildup in the lungs can result in coughing, wheezing, and breathing difficulty.\n\nE = Edema (water retention). When the heart doesn\u2019t have enough pumping power to force used blood back up from the lower extremities, fluid can collect in the ankles, legs, thighs, and abdomen. Excess fluid can also cause rapid weight gain in the form of water weight.\n\nS = Shortness of breath. Fluid in the lungs makes it more difficult for carbon dioxide in used blood to be exchanged for fresh oxygen. Your breathing will be difficult not just during activities, even if just sitting or lying down.\n\nOf course, just because you feel any one of these warning signs, doesn\u2019t mean you have heart failure. But if you have 2 or more, you should go see a doctor. If you have 4-5 of these FACES symptoms, take action immediately and see your doctor as soon as possible.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is and will always be a blood flow and circulation problem, which can most certainly be improved, naturally.\n\nPoor circulation affects your entire body, from head to toe \u2013 not just your heart.\n\nI\u2019ve got an important link and topics about natural ways of supporting healthy blood flow.\n\nPlus a second article that has simple and proven ways of lessening your symptoms, strengthening your heart, and improving this situation so you can avoid heart problems.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "In one of my previous articles entitled, \u201cWhich Foods Can Support Healthy Blood Flow & Circulation\u201d. A reader asked the following question:\n\nI like your ARTICLES\u2026I work out 5 days a week ..I also have bad circulation in my legs..Does warm hot packs help?\n\nThis is a great question because many people start having poor circulation as they get older, especially in the lower body. Legs, feet, and for us guys \u2013 your penis as well. Which means smaller and poorer erections.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll quickly discuss:\n\nHeat and cold treatments\n\nBest rep ranges for legs\n\nBest vitamins and herbs for circulation\n\nSo the answer is YES, hot packs do work. The heat supports blood flow to the area, which means more nutrients, oxygen, and hormones.\n\nHowever, I would also switch off with cold packs to reduce the inflammation \u2013 especially after you work out.\n\nRemember, more inflammation means less circulation.\n\nBest Way to Use Hot or Cold Packs\n\nAs far as how long, how hot or cold: You can do 10-20 minutes of heat and then later, do the same amount of time in the cold.\n\nThere\u2019s no specific science, so don\u2019t worry about it.\n\nBy the way, if you can stand to do an ice bath for your lower body, even if it\u2019s just 2-3x weekly \u2013 this will help a lot with the inflammation, which means better blood flow.\n\nJust don\u2019t do it before your workouts, always any time after.\n\nLeg Repetition Ranges\n\nAdditionally, the lower body responds very well to higher repetitions.\n\nSo, doing sets of high reps, 20 to as high as 50 reps, will really support healthy blood flow, and build new capillaries. In addition to building more muscle.\n\nYou can do this at the gym obviously \u2014 but even at home, just doing bodyweight squats for high reps is great.\n\nLook at velodrome riders and speed skater\u2019s legs \u2013 they have supermassive legs and it\u2019s all done with high reps.\n\nAnother Easy Way to Get Good Blood Flow\n\nLastly, take natural herbs & vitamins.\n\nThis stuff is amazing at supporting healthy blood flow throughout your entire body \u2013 muscles, cells, heart, brain, penis, etc.\n\nAdditionally, it makes your blood vessels stronger and more flexible.\n\nIt also helps remove toxins and heavy metals from your blood, which improves circulation obviously.\n\nMost importantly, it removes plaque buildup and calcium from your arteries, which support blood flow from head to toe, including your brain \u2013 which improves your mind and memory.\n\nUsing heat, ice baths, and high-rep leg workouts will immediately give you healthy blood flow, in the short term.\n\nAnd use natural herbs and vitamins for long-term results, throughout your entire body.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "There are a lot of different ways to improve your health and this also applies to today\u2019s topic of healthy blood pressure.\n\nOf course, lifestyle improvement is the most important:\n\nDiet \u2013 What you eat/drink and don\u2019t eat/drink\n\nExercise \u2013 both cardiovascular and lifting weights\n\nNutritional Supplements\n\nIn fact, at the end of today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll tell you exactly how my dad got healthy blood pressure, naturally.\n\nHowever, when it comes to lowering blood pressure, you can also do so with 5 simple and proven pressure points on your body.\n\nThis is really important because obviously, you don\u2019t need drugs. But also because the benefits are felt instantly and it\u2019s super easy and convenient. You can activate these pressure points anytime, anywhere.\n\nJust remember, as of 2025, in the US, 33% of the population has blood pressure points. Over 50% have \u201cpre\u201d condition. Sadly, about 75% of people don\u2019t even know they have blood pressure and thus, are at risk for heart or kidney problems.\n\nAnd this is why blood pressure is called \u201cthe silent killer\u201d\u2026 people just don\u2019t know they have it and there are no clear symptoms either.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started with:\n\nPressure point #1 is LI 4 (Large Intestine 4)\n\nLI 4 (Large Intestine 4) is really easy to get to. It\u2019s in that \u201cmeaty\u201d part of your upper hand, between your thumb and forefinger. Just use your other hand\u2019s thumb to apply pressure for 1-2 minutes or treat it with a pulsating movement.\n\nIn addition to supporting healthy blood pressure, it also helps treat chronic pain and boosts your immune system.\n\nPressure Point #2 is PC 6 (Pericardium 6 or \u201cInner Gate\u201d)\n\nPC 6 (Pericardium 6 or \u201cInner Gate\u201d) is also easy to get to. It\u2019s on your inner forearm. To find it, go approximately 3 fingers up from your wrist \u2013 it\u2019s at the bottom of your inner forearm basically.\n\nIt helps your heart and settles your blood pressure by regulating your circulatory system. It can also treat nausea, headaches, and motion sickness.\n\nPressure Point #3 is LV 3 (Liver 3)\n\nThis is on your foot, between your big toe and second toe. Again, apply pressure for about a minute. This helps with blood pressure, in addition to menstrual pains and anxiety.\n\nIn general, your feet have a variety of pressure points, which, when massaged, can bring a great improvement to your health. In fact, there\u2019s an entire healing practice focused on your feet and it\u2019s called Reflexology.\n\nPressure Point #4 is GB 20 (Gallbladder 20 or the \u201cWind Pool\u201d)\n\nThis is found at the base of your neck, right under your skull. There are 2 points actually on each side of your vertebrae. Again, apply gentle pressure on both of these points, left and right, for about a minute.\n\nKeep your hands steady, and don\u2019t involve any other motion. When doing it to yourself, use your thumbs.\n\nPressure Point #5 is GV 20 (Governing Vessel 20 or \u201cHundred Convergences\u201d)\n\nThis is found at the top of your head, in the middle. You can massage or press this point to support healthy blood pressure, treat dizziness, or just feel more rested.\n\nThese are the 5 best pressure points for supporting healthy blood pressure.\n\nOf course, as stated earlier\u2026 the problem is that there are no symptoms of blood pressure problems, so you never know if you have it or not thus, when do you use these pressure points?\u2026\n\nI suggest you use them to simply relax when you feel stressed, tired, or overwhelmed.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

However, if you\u2019re also not achieving rock-solid erections every time you\u2019re going to have sex\u2026 like used to when you were younger\u2026\n\nThen you should also read this article because \u201cweak\u201d erections are an indicator that your health is not optimal\u2026. Both with respect to hormonal imbalances, as well as decreased blood flow and circulation.\n\nIn fact, Rush University Medical Center1 states that bad circulation is one of the most common causes of erectile dysfunction, second to hormonal imbalance.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that the newest research shows that men with erectile dysfunction (ED), typically also have heart problems.2 Thus, ED is a pre-warning sign that you may have heart failure in the future because you have a buildup of plaque and calcium in your blood vessels.2\n\n3 Clinically Proven Ways To Increase Blood Flow & Improve Your Erections\n\nDiet can play a big role in improving your heart health and reducing your risk for a buildup of plaque. It\u2019s never too late to eat a healthier diet. Just as years of bad eating can damage your body, good eating can help heal it and it can happen quickly.\n\nAdd more \u201chealthy\u201d fats to your diet. These are typically mono and polyunsaturated fats. They\u2019re found in foods like olives, raw seeds and nuts, avocados, and fish. These should be RAW and uncooked.\n\nEliminate \u201cunhealthy\u201d and artificial sources of trans fats. Most artificial trans fats are found in processed, packaged foods like cookies and snack cakes. These have been heated and are hydrogenated. They are also high in omega-6 fats, which cause inflammation.\n\nIncrease your fiber intake. Soluble fiber helps prevent and remove plaque buildup. You can find soluble fiber in foods like vegetables, lentils, beans, and oats. I would also add fiber supplements as well, especially if you have a hard time getting it all from food.\n\nCut back on sugar. The sugar found in processed foods like cookies, ice cream, and sugar-sweetened beverages has no nutritional value. Unfortunately, sugar is hidden in almost all \u201cman-made\u201d foods. They increase your blood sugar levels\u2026 Which when combined with unhealthy fats, clogs your arteries.\n\nFirst, we all need to move more. All we tend to do is sit all day long \u2014 computer, phone, driving, eating, work, etc.\n\nThe reason exercise is important is that it helps improve your youth hormones, which then helps your body naturally get rid of toxins \u2013 this includes plaque.\n\nAnd in my opinion, \u201cresistance exercise\u201d is more important than cardiovascular. This means lifting weights \u2013 which can be with free weights, machines, cables or simply your own body weight.\n\nAnd if you work out quickly, it will also give you a very strong cardiovascular workout at the same time.\n\nYou only need 3x weekly and I would add in daily walking as well.\n\nTaking specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals that can help support healthy blood flow and circulation will give you the biggest and fastest improvements in preventing AND removing plaque buildup.\n\nAnd you can get more information about which ones are the best, by clicking the special link below this article. Of course, supplements do NOT take the place of a healthy lifestyle.\n\nHowever, when combined together, it\u2019s like being on \u201csteroids\u201d. You\u2019ll get much faster and more dramatic results, with LESS effort.\n\nAnd for many people, like my own parents, it made the biggest difference in REMOVING the plaque buildup \u2014 more so than preventing it.\n\nIf you want to finally fix your ED problems and dramatically improve your sex drive, make sure you improve your hormones, and don\u2019t forget to ALSO support healthy blood flow.\n\nYour heart, mind, AND penis will thank you!\n\nSo make sure you eat better, exercise, and take specific supplements.\n\nMake small improvements daily and within a few weeks and months, you\u2019ll see and feel dramatic improvements.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/discover-health\n\nSchwartz BG, et al.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/how-to-improve-blood-flow-circulation-to-your-hands/",
    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from Deborah and she asks:\n\n\u201cI must have really bad blood flow to my hands because they are always cold. And sometimes for no reason, they just go numb. How can I have healthy circulation to my hands?\u201d\n\nWhen someone speaks about poor blood flow, they typically think about their legs and feet\u2026\n\nHowever, hands are also very common and I personally had issues with this myself a few years ago.\n\nFor me, it was always cold hands and I hated it because I never wanted to touch anyone or shake someone\u2019s hands.\n\nOf course, I\u2019ve since fixed this problem and I\u2019ll show you what I\u2019ve done in a minute.\n\nCauses Of Poor Blood Flow To Your Hands\n\nOne cause of poor blood flow to your hands would be carpal tunnel syndrome, which is more typical these days because everyone is on their computer or phones.\n\nAnother cause would be that your back isn\u2019t aligned well and you need a chiropractic adjustment or a massage to relax the muscles around your spine and neck.\n\nAgain, this is more prevalent these days because we\u2019re sitting so long, hunched over the computer with poor posture.\n\nFinally, another major reason for poor blood flow would be because inflammation\u2026 which requires an anti-inflammatory diet and anti-inflammatory supplements, herbs, and vitamins.\n\nSo far I\u2019m mentioning CAUSES and I\u2019ll get to SOLUTIONS in a minute\u2026.\n\nWhy This Is So Important To Fix NOW!\u2026\n\nHowever, it\u2019s VERY IMPORTANT to know that poor blood flow and circulation is one of the primary causes of heart problems. This is because it can lead to\n\nBlood pressure problems\n\nHardening and narrowing of your arteries\n\nCholesterol and plaque build-up\n\nSo whether you feel it in your hands or your feet, it\u2019s a WARNING SIGN that you MUST support healthy blood flow and circulation.\n\nSolutions For Improved Blood Flow & Circulation To Your Hands\n\nSo let\u2019s continue and I\u2019ll quickly reveal one of the 3 best solutions for improving blood flow and circulation to your hands.\n\nThis is for strengthening your grip and your hand muscles while increasing blood flow. Grab anything you can squeeze\u2026 this can be something \u201csoft\u201d, such as rolled-up socks. Or something a lot firmer like a tennis ball.\n\nIf you\u2019re weak, start with something softer and build up to a firmer tennis ball as you gain strength. You should squeeze the object, then HOLD for at least 1-2 seconds, then release. That\u2019s ONE repetition.\n\nDo at least 10 repetitions and work up to 20-30 reps\u2026 or until you feel a good burn in your hands. That\u2019s ONE set. Then go to the other hand, do another set. Then back to the original hand. Better to start with your STRONGER hand.\n\nYou should do 2-3 sets of at least 15 or more repetitions, 3x weekly on alternate days. Such as Mon, Wed and Fri.\n\nRemember, you need to squeeze and HOLD to really FEEL the muscles contract and increase blood flow and muscle contractions to the area.\n\nAfter you\u2019re done, massage and stretch your hands and forearms.\n\nNow we want to strengthen your wrist and your forearm muscles. To do this, you\u2019ll do wrist curls and reverse wrist curls.\n\nTo do a wrist curl, you\u2019ll need a light dumbbell and slowly curl the weight from the bottom to the top. You can put your forearms on your leg, on a bench or anything stable. Do 3 sets of 15-25 repetitions, 3x weekly.\n\nAnd then you\u2019ll also want to do reverse wrist curls for the top of your forearms. Same idea, but going the opposite direction. Again, 3 sets of 15-25 repetitions, 3x weekly.\n\nJust like the hand squeezing/gripping exercise, do these on alternate days \u2026 But this time, let\u2019s do it on OTHER days \u2014 Tues/Thurs/Sat if possible. This way we are exercising your hands and forearms every day.\n\nHowever, if that\u2019s not possible, just do them all on the same days as the gripping exercise \u2014 Mon/Wed/Fri.\n\nEven though this video is about blood flow to your hands, your BODY as a WHOLE requires better circulation\u2026 and I think walking is one of the best exercises you can do and almost anyone can do it, anywhere, any time of the day and it doesn\u2019t cost you anything.\n\nIdeally, you would walk outside in fresh air if possible. First thing morning and/or late evening are good times but, whenever you can is a better than nothing.\n\nTo start, all you need is about 15 minutes, 3x weekly. Ideally, you would work up to daily walks of about 30 minutes.\n\nAnd if you have pain or trouble walking, even 3 minutes is a good start. Try your best to walk just a little bit every single day.\n\nPoor blood flow is bad for your health because it affects your entire body. The best exercises for improved circulation, especially to your hands is:\n\nHand Gripping Exercises\n\nOf course, you should get the \u201cokay\u201d from your doctor before starting any exercise program. But use common sense and start slowly and build up every week \u2013 intensity, duration, and frequency.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "The Most Important Mineral For Healthy Blood Pressure | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/the-most-important-mineral-for-instantly-lowering-your-blood-pressure/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal one of the most important minerals for supporting healthy blood pressure and improving your heart\u2019s health.\n\nIn fact, research has demonstrated1-3 the vital role this mineral plays in your cardiovascular health, by reducing your risk for heart problems and plaque build-up in your arteries.\n\nThis invaluable mineral is important to the health of every cell and organ, playing a role in over 600 different reactions in your body.\n\nSo what mineral am I speaking of?\u2026\n\nWhen magnesium levels are low, you can have major problems with your muscles and organs.\n\nSymptoms of a deficiency can include unexplained fatigue or muscle weakness, abnormal heart rhythms, eye twitches, muscle spasms, restlessness, insomnia, and even hair loss.\n\nUnfortunately, determining a deficiency of magnesium from a simple blood sample isn\u2019t possible, because only 1 percent of the magnesium in your body is found in your bloodstream. Instead, most of your magnesium will be found stored in your bones and organs.\n\nIt is quite possible to be unaware of a deficiency, which is why it has been dubbed the \u201cinvisible deficiency.\u201d Some researchers estimate that up to 80% of Americans do not get enough magnesium from their diet to replace the magnesium lost.1\n\nI bring this up because studies have shown that less than 25% of US adults are getting the minimum requirements for magnesium \u2013 which is only about 300 mg for women and 400 mg for men.2\n\nEven more concerning to your overall health, these amounts are just barely enough to stop your body from experiencing the overt symptoms of a deficiency, but not enough to support optimal health.\n\nMagnesium & Blood Pressure\n\nI could go on and on about the importance of Magnesium, but I hope you get the point. However, today I want to focus on lowering your blood pressure.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t already know, 1 out of 3 Americans (33%) suffers from blood pressure problems.3 \u2026 Sadly, \u00bd of these people don\u2019t even know they have heart problems, and less than 20% have this under control.3\n\nIn fact, having blood pressure problems is known as the \u201csilent killer\u201d because there are no real symptoms. Other than getting your blood pressure tested regularly, it\u2019s hard to tell if yours will be elevated or if it\u2019s normal.\n\nHowever, the good news is that in a clinical study5, people who had the highest levels of serum magnesium had a\n\n48% lower risk of blood pressure problems\n\n69% lower risk of blood sugar problems\n\n42% lower risk for CAC, which is the hardening of your arteries.\n\nAll very positive for your heart and overall health.\n\nOne type of drug prescribed for blood pressure is \u201ccalcium channel blockers\u201d. These are medicines that relax and widen blood vessels, therefore allowing the blood to flow through the blood vessels smoothly, supporting healthy blood pressure.\n\nThe good news is that magnesium acts like a calcium channel blocker, easing blood vessel flow and lowering blood pressure \u2013 naturally, without any synthetic drugs.\n\nIt was found in a human clinical study6 of more than 8,500 people that a higher intake of magnesium may decrease the risk of blood pressure problems.\n\nWhere To Get Your Magnesium From\n\nUnfortunately, getting optimal magnesium levels can be difficult because most foods are depleted of vitamins and minerals. And most supplements of magnesium are poorly absorbed.\n\nAs far as the best \u201cmagnesium-rich\u201d foods, most of it is greens and vegetables:\n\nRaw seeds: Pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower have the highest\n\nRaw nuts: Cashews, almonds, and Brazil nuts are the best sources\n\nFatty fish: Wild-caught Alaskan salmon and mackerel are the best sources\n\nUnfortunately, getting optimal magnesium levels can be difficult because most foods are depleted of vitamins and minerals.\n\nObviously, taking a pill is a lot easier and more efficient. Unfortunately, there are about 9 common forms of magnesium supplements, which can get very confusing.\n\nMagnesium Amino Acid Chelate\n\nMagnesium Glycinate, Malate & Taurates\n\nThe difference between all of these is that some are better absorbed than others. Some will cause diarrhea at a higher dosage. Some are better at relaxing your muscles. Some are better at reducing your stress\u2026 etc., etc.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Best Form?\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve tested many different forms and combinations and I\u2019ve discovered the best is a combination of 4 different magnesium, which are clinically proven for maximum absorption:\n\nTRAACS\u00ae Magnesium Glycinate\n\nAlbion\u00ae Di-Magnesium Malate\n\nIn fact, when this combination is added to other herbs and vitamins, you will support healthy blood pressure WITHOUT any change in your diet or exercise.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms-and-diagnosis\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2014/12/31/health/magnesium-deficiency-health/index.html\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_bloodpressure.htm\n\nhttp://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311571.php\n\nhttps://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-016-0143-3\n\nhttp://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/magnesium",

    "content": "I write today\u2019s post on Valentine\u2019s Day. However, what I want to share can and SHOULD be applied to any and ALL days! It\u2019s good for your heart, mind and body\u2026\n\nDay Of Giving Additional Love\n\nValentine\u2019s Day is typically about giving additional love or recognition to that \u201cspecial someone\u201d in your life. However, I want to take it a step further \u2014 today is a day that you should give additional love to EVERYONE, including YOURSELF!\n\nNow, if you have someone special in your life, make sure you let them know just HOW special they are to you.\n\nWHY you appreciate them\u2026\n\nAnd HOW they make your life better.\n\nIt can be about anything, but make sure it\u2019s specific. The more detailed, the better.\n\nGiving a general compliment is nice, but it\u2019s a bit superficial, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2026\n\nExpress It \u2013 Verbally!\n\nGifts are nice as well. But I think expressing yourself, verbally and/or written format is ideal (card, text, email and of course, a handwritten letter!).\n\nPeople don\u2019t communicate with much depth these days. Please don\u2019t just text a simple sentence, that\u2019s lame. Put some thought into it and share something important that comes from your heart and it\u2019s genuine.\n\nDon\u2019t Forget About YOU!\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have someone special in your life, that\u2019s fine too. Better than being in a bad relationship and having to \u201cforce\u201d it and be fake, right?\n\nInstead, make sure you also give extra love to yourself! Yes, I know it may sound or feel weird\u2026 but just do it. You deserve it!\n\nRemember, you can\u2019t give something you don\u2019t have \u2013 this includes love.\n\nAnd we all have love inside of us. Sometimes it just seems to be buried down deep, under all of life\u2019s stresses and pains.\n\nLove & Appreciate YOURSELF!\n\nSo, look in the mirror and let yourself know all that you appreciate about YOU. Maybe write yourself a \u201clove\u201d letter if you want to be really bold =)\n\nOr, just keep it simple \u2026 But make sure you give yourself extra love, attention and appreciation today as well.\n\nDon\u2019t Forget Other People\n\nLastly, don\u2019t forget \u201cother\u201d people \u2014 friends, family, parents, kids, pets, etc.\n\nRemember, Valentine\u2019s Day is about giving love \u2013 not just if you\u2019re in a relationship, but to YOURSELF and other people around you.\n\nNow, don\u2019t just read this \u2026 go DO it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s never too late. If you\u2019re reading this the day after, you can still give love today \u2013 even if it\u2019s no longer Valentine\u2019s Day\n\nWith sincere gratitude, appreciation and love\u2026 Warmest Regards Dr. Sam",

    "content": "A friend of mine forwarded me these pictures in an email a few weeks back. The reason I\u2019m showing you these, is not because of politics, or to say anything negative OR positive about the US, Japan or anyone else.\n\nBut, the point is on a PERSONAL level.\n\nWhen I saw these pictures (just make sure you scroll all the way to the bottom\u2026), later I thought to myself \u201cHmm\u2026 where am I going to be a year from now?\u2026 5, 10, 20+ years?\u201d\n\nI want you to ask yourself this same question. Relationships, financial or health \u2013 are you going to get ACTIVE and change your life, or just let it \u201cfall apart\u201d (as it has in the below pictures of Detroit)?\n\nAnd trust me, money can be made and lost \u2013 but your health is not something for you to ignore. Are you going to allow yourself to get fatter, become unhealthier, let your insides (heart, lungs, arteries, muscles) get weaker and weaker?\n\nAt the end, it\u2019s up to YOU. Just don\u2019t make silly, \u201clazy\u201d excuses because at the end, YOU are the only person who loses or wins!\u2026.\n\nHiroshima, Nagasaki in 1945 \u2013 After an atomic bomb\u2026.\n\nNOW \u2013 65+ Years Later\u2026.\n\nDetroit, US \u2013 65+ Years After Hiroshima\u2026.\n\nAgain, the point of this email is NOT political, but PERSONAL. Where are YOU going to be in 1, 3, 5, 10+ years? And honestly, it ALWAYS starts with your health \u2013 both physical and mental.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll utilize this newsletter to hopefully MOTIVATE yourself to make a positive change, rather than \u201cfeel sorry\u201d or make a \u201clazy excuse\u201d.\n\nRemember, change happens in an instant \u2026 a split second. Let me know your thoughts below, I do read them all. Thanks!\n\nWith sincere appreciation & warmest regards,",
