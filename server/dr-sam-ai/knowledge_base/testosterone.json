    "content": "Today, you\u2019re going to discover how you can have an easier time getting erections and orgasms more often by manipulating one hormone.\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not testosterone, estrogen, or even cortisol.\n\nIn fact, optimizing this one hormone will increase your testosterone and dopamine levels at the same time, while also improving your mood and sex drive.\n\nI\u2019ll also reveal how you can do this naturally with food, lifestyle, and supplements \u2013 or with two specific drugs, both of which I\u2019ve personally used.\n\nEither way, you\u2019ll have clear choices and real solutions.\n\nA Subscriber\u2019s Blood Test Wake-Up Call\n\nA subscriber recently asked me a question after running a detailed hormone blood test on his own.\n\nHis prolactin came back elevated at 34 ng/mL, while his testosterone was in the low-middle range at 461 ng/mL.\n\nHe explained that his sex drive was lower, erections were harder to maintain, and orgasms were more difficult to achieve.\n\nHe also mentioned puffy nipples, low motivation, and a flat mood \u2014 all classic signs of elevated prolactin.\n\nSo let\u2019s break this down.\n\nProlactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. In women, it stimulates breast milk production.\n\nIn men, prolactin should remain low and helps regulate testosterone, dopamine, and reproductive function.\n\nWhen prolactin rises too high, problems begin.\n\nElevated prolactin is linked to:\n\nLower testosterone levels\n\nLower dopamine levels\n\nLonger refractory periods\n\nReduced libido and erectile dysfunction\n\nGynecomastia (man boobs)\n\nLow motivation and mood issues\n\nThis is why lowering elevated prolactin often results in better erections, stronger orgasms, and higher sex drive.\n\nWhy Prolactin Kills Erections\n\nProlactin is inversely related to dopamine.\n\nWhen dopamine is high, prolactin is low. When prolactin rises, dopamine falls.\n\nDuring sexual arousal, dopamine increases. After orgasm, prolactin spikes and dopamine drops.\n\nWhen prolactin stays chronically elevated, this suppresses testosterone, dopamine, and sexual responsiveness.\n\nThat\u2019s why high prolactin leads to longer refractory periods \u2013 meaning it takes much longer to get another erection or orgasm.\n\nSymptoms of High Prolactin in Men\n\nInfertility or low sperm count\n\nVision issues (in severe cases)\n\nA blood test is always the best way to confirm elevated prolactin.\n\nMain Causes of High Prolactin\n\nIn extreme cases (over 250 ng/mL), the cause is often a benign pituitary tumor.\n\nHowever, most men experience elevated prolactin from much more common causes.\n\nAntidepressants and antipsychotics\n\nBlood pressure medications\n\nOpiates and pain medications\n\nAcid reflux medications\n\nAntihistamines and anticonvulsants\n\nAnabolic steroids (especially 19-nor compounds)\n\nChronic stress (high cortisol)\n\nExcessive high-intensity training\n\nExcessive nipple stimulation\n\nHow to Lower Prolactin Naturally\n\nManaging stress and improving sleep are the most important lifestyle factors.\n\nChronic cortisol elevation directly raises prolactin.\n\nModerate exercise is helpful, but overtraining increases prolactin through cortisol and adrenaline.\n\nSupplements That Actually Work\n\nP5P (Activated Vitamin B6) Supports dopamine production and helps suppress prolactin. 50 mg daily is more than enough.\n\nZinc + Copper 15\u201330 mg zinc with the proper copper ratio lowers prolactin, estrogen, and DHT.\n\nVelvet Bean Extract (25% L-DOPA) Direct dopamine precursor. 100 mg daily is effective. Max dose: 200 mg.\n\nThese ingredients are found together in AlphaViril, which is why I\u2019ve used it for over 25 years.\n\nPrescription Options (Use Sparingly)\n\nDisclaimer: Always speak to your doctor before using medications.\n\nCabergoline (Dostinex)\n\nThis dopamine agonist directly shuts down prolactin production.\n\nA very low dose \u2014 0.25 mg once per week \u2013 can dramatically lower prolactin.\n\nHowever, higher or frequent dosing is associated with heart valve damage.\n\nThis should only be used occasionally, not regularly.\n\nBromocriptine (Parlodel)\n\nLess powerful than cabergoline, with a shorter half-life.\n\nIt must be taken more frequently and causes more side effects.\n\nLow doses (0.625\u20131.25 mg) can still be effective.\n\nHigh prolactin quietly destroys erections, libido, testosterone, and motivation.\n\nThe solution starts with lowering stress and cortisol, improving sleep, and supporting dopamine.\n\nFor supplements, P5P, zinc + copper, and velvet bean extract are usually more than enough.\n\nPrescription drugs should only be a last resort and used sparingly.\n\nFix prolactin, and you\u2019ll naturally improve testosterone, dopamine, erections, orgasms, mood, and confidence.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/this-body-part-secretly-predicts-your-penis-size/",
    "content": "What part of the body predicts penis size best?\n\nAccording to a [current_size] study, it\u2019s not height, hand size, or foot length \u2014 it\u2019s actually the nose.\n\nSurprised? You\u2019re not alone.\n\nToday, you\u2019ll learn about this surprising discovery and more importantly, how you can actually increase penis size and hardness at any age.\n\nWe\u2019ll also break down the role of testosterone and DHT, what causes penis shrinkage, and how to reverse it naturally \u2013 even in adulthood.\n\nDoes Body Size Really Predict Penis Size?\n\nWomen often comment on my large hands and feet \u2014 and assume I must be well-endowed.\n\nWhile I\u2019m taller than average and above average in size, that assumption can create unrealistic expectations.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, 10 inches is not normal \u2014 or common.\n\nStill, the myth persists.\n\nMost people believe that taller men or those with bigger feet and hands must also have a bigger penis.\n\nBut is this really true?\n\nWhat Science Actually Says\n\nResearchers in Japan examined 136 deceased men between the ages of 30 and 50.\n\nAll measurements were taken within three days of their passing to ensure accuracy.\n\nThey recorded flaccid and stretched penile length, as well as testicle size, prostate weight, and several other body features. In urology, stretched penile length is commonly used to estimate erect size.\n\nThe Unexpected Finding\n\nHeight, weight, hand size, and foot size had zero correlation with penis size.\n\nNose length was the only trait linked to penile length \u2014 not girth.\n\nThe longer the nose, the longer the penis \u2013 statistically speaking.\n\nThis study shows that penis size is largely determined before birth.\n\nSo yes, genetics and prenatal hormone exposure play a major role.\n\nBut does that mean you\u2019re stuck with whatever size you were born with?\n\nNot quite. While you can\u2019t change your genes, you can absolutely influence your hormones and penile tissue growth as an adult.\n\nHormones That Control Penis Size\n\nTwo hormones are primarily responsible for penis development:\n\nTestosterone \u2014 critical during puberty for growth\n\nDHT (Dihydrotestosterone) \u2014 much stronger, crucial during fetal development\n\nDuring pregnancy, if the mother doesn\u2019t produce enough hCG, the fetus can\u2019t produce enough testosterone.\n\nThis often results in a smaller penis.\n\nAdditionally, exposure to toxins such as pesticides or phthalates can lower fetal hormone levels, which may also impact development.\n\nLow androgens in the first trimester can result in ambiguous genitalia.\n\nLater in pregnancy, it may cause a condition known as micropenis.\n\nWhat About Men Without DHT?\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, some men are born without the 5-alpha reductase enzyme.\n\nThis means their bodies can\u2019t convert testosterone to DHT.\n\nHave underdeveloped genitals, despite normal testosterone levels\n\nThis genetic trait inspired the creation of drugs like Finasteride, which reduce DHT to prevent hair loss and prostate growth \u2014 but can also shrink the penis or reduce libido.\n\nHow It Works Across Life Stages\n\nDHT is essential for early penis formation.\n\nTestosterone must be present, but it\u2019s the conversion to DHT that triggers proper development.\n\nTestosterone levels surge, causing rapid penis growth.\n\nDHT still plays a role, but it is less directly related to size.\n\nSimply put, you need both hormones, but at different life stages.\n\nDHT dominates during fetal growth. Testosterone takes over during puberty.\n\nCan Adults Grow Their Penis?\n\nYes, but not through gimmicks.\n\nHere\u2019s the proven formula:\n\nStimulate tissue with penis-specific exercises\n\nIncrease testosterone levels\n\nThink of it like muscle growth: exercise is the stimulus, and testosterone is the fuel.\n\nThe same applies here. The higher your testosterone, the more responsive the tissue.\n\nBonus: My Free Email Series\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about growth, I created a free step-by-step email series.\n\nOver 57,000 men have already followed it.\n\nDaily routines and exercises\n\nHormone-boosting tips\n\nAdvice on erection quality and frequency\n\nYou\u2019ll also learn how to improve DHT sensitivity \u2013 without side effects.\n\nPro tip: Don\u2019t underestimate your hormone health. Start fixing that first, optimize your testosterone levels, and your results will multiply.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, get my penis enlargement guide now \u2013 it\u2019s totally free.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/does-semen-retention-boost-testosterone-guide/",
    "content": "\u201cHow much does semen retention increase testosterone levels? I heard it can more than double it.\u201d\n\nThis is a hot topic across social media.\n\nTikTok, YouTube, and Reddit are full of claims that semen retention boosts testosterone by 145% or more.\n\nBut what does the science say?\n\nWhat Is Semen Retention?\n\nSemen retention is when you avoid ejaculation, either by not having sex or masturbation or by stopping before climax.\n\nIt\u2019s also known as \u201cNoFap.\u201d\n\nWhere Did the 145% Claim Come From?\n\nThis idea came from a 2003 Chinese study.\n\nIt showed a slight testosterone increase on day 7 of abstinence.\n\nHowever, by day 8, levels returned to normal. There was no lasting benefit.\n\nDespite this, many influencers still push the idea that retention massively increases testosterone \u2013 but that\u2019s not what the data shows.\n\nWhy Doesn\u2019t Semen Retention Work Long-Term?\n\nYour body likes balance \u2014 homeostasis.\n\nHormones like testosterone are tightly regulated.\n\nThe only way to significantly raise it is through external means (like TRT or specific compounds).\n\nWhat Other Studies Say\n\nMore recent research paints a different picture.\n\nFor example, a 2021 New York study found that frequent ejaculation was linked to higher testosterone, not less.\n\nOther reviews have found only small hormonal fluctuations in the first few days of abstinence.\n\nAnd those famous \u201c145% increase\u201d studies? They were either flawed or later retracted.\n\nWhat Actually Happens After Orgasm?\n\nIt\u2019s not testosterone that changes \u2014 it\u2019s other hormones like:\n\nProlactin increases \u2014 makes you relaxed, slows recovery\n\nDopamine drops \u2014 temporarily lowers desire\n\nWhen you\u2019re younger, recovery is fast. As you age, your body takes longer to bounce back.\n\nIs Retention Harmful?\n\nNo \u2013 but obsessing over it can be.\n\nStress, guilt, and unhealthy views about sex can hurt your mental and physical health more than a little ejaculation ever will.\n\nSo\u2026 What Actually Increases Testosterone?\n\nIf you want to naturally raise testosterone, focus on:\n\nLifting weights \u2013 3 \u2013 5x per week. Avoid overtraining, which raises cortisol.\n\nBetter sleep \u2013 Most hormone production happens during sleep. Aim for deep, consistent rest.\n\nLosing body fat \u2013 Less fat = less estrogen = better testosterone balance.\n\nManaging stress \u2013 High cortisol destroys testosterone. Reduce toxic inputs, including people, media, and clutter.\n\nEating clean \u2013 Whole eggs, less sugar, and no fried junk. Cholesterol helps make testosterone.\n\nPersonal tip: I eat 3\u20134 whole eggs at night. I\u2019ve noticed better morning erections when I do.\n\nCoincidence? Maybe. But I\u2019ve seen the pattern repeat for years.\n\nNatural supplements help if you\u2019re too busy (or lazy) to optimize everything. That\u2019s why I use AlphaViril \u2013 and have for 25 years.\n\nTotal & free testosterone\n\nDopamine support for better libido & mood\n\nIt\u2019s clinically backed, works in 30 days or less, and comes with a full money-back guarantee plus $100 bonus if you don\u2019t see results.\n\nSemen retention won\u2019t double your testosterone.\n\nThe science simply doesn\u2019t support it.\n\nBut if you want to avoid orgasm for other reasons \u2013 fine.\n\nJust don\u2019t expect a hormonal miracle.\n\nInstead, focus on what works: smart training, sleep, clean food, less stress, and optional support like AlphaViril.\n\nAnd yes \u2013 enjoy your orgasms.\n\nTrust me, when you\u2019re older, you won\u2019t be having them as often. Enjoy it now while you can.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "If you\u2019re concerned about erections, testosterone levels, or if you\u2019re on TRT, taking Clomid, Enclomiphene, HCG, or even herbal testosterone boosters, today\u2019s article is important.\n\nWhether you\u2019re short or fat, bald or hairy, want to fix prostate issues, improve your mood, gain confidence, or get leaner \u2014 this topic applies to you.\n\nToday, we\u2019re talking about estrogen. Specifically, how to manage it properly \u2014 because if you don\u2019t, it could quietly sabotage all your progress.\n\nMost guys ask me, \u201cMy testosterone is fine, but I have low libido or weak erections.\u201d I always follow up with: \u201cWhat\u2019s your estrogen level?\u201d\n\nUsually, they don\u2019t know. But it matters \u2014 a lot.\n\nI\u2019ve personally experienced both high and low estrogen.\n\nBoth caused different problems, and neither one felt good.\n\nWhat Happens When Estrogen Is Too High?\n\nWhen your estrogen levels are elevated, you might experience:\n\nErectile dysfunction and low sex drive\n\nGynecomastia (man boobs)\n\nWater retention and bloating\n\nMood swings, irritability, and even depression\n\nProstate problems and higher cancer risk\n\nEstrogen also tells your brain to stop producing testosterone.\n\nThat\u2019s why many men feel worse as they age \u2014 not because testosterone drops, but because estrogen rises and throws off the balance.\n\nAnd here\u2019s something you may not realize: fat cells produce estrogen.\n\nSo, the fatter you are, the higher your estrogen levels \u2014 even without TRT or steroids.\n\nWhat About Low Estrogen?\n\nOn the flip side, too little estrogen is just as bad.\n\nIf you crash it with drugs or take the wrong dose of an aromatase inhibitor, you might experience:\n\nJoint pain and dry skin\n\nLow libido and poor erections\n\nBrain fog or feeling emotionally flat\n\nWorsened cholesterol or heart health\n\nFatigue and poor recovery\n\nSo clearly, it\u2019s all about finding the right balance \u2014 not just blasting testosterone or blocking estrogen completely.\n\nWhat Causes High Estrogen in Men?\n\nThere are several common causes of elevated estrogen:\n\nHigher body fat (especially belly fat)\n\nAging (aromatase enzyme increases)\n\nAlcohol and marijuana use\n\nEnvironmental toxins (plastics, pesticides, etc.)\n\nChronic stress and poor sleep\n\nAnd sometimes, it\u2019s genetic.\n\nSome men naturally convert more testosterone into estrogen due to higher aromatase activity.\n\nWhat About Low Estrogen?\n\nLow estrogen typically results from:\n\nToo much use of estrogen blockers\n\nExtreme fat loss or low body fat\n\nAge-related hormone decline\n\nCertain medications or overtraining\n\nAgain, the goal is balance \u2014 not elimination.\n\nPrescription Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs)\n\nIf you\u2019re using TRT, Clomid, or HCG, you may need a low dose of an AI to manage estrogen.\n\nThere are 3 common options:\n\nArimidex (Anastrozole) \u2013 Fast-acting, reversible. Usually 0.25\u20131mg, 1\u20133x/week.\n\nFemara (Letrozole) \u2013 Very strong. Rarely used due to intensity.\n\nAromasin (Exemestane) \u2013 Irreversible. Longer-lasting. I personally use this.\n\nNote: Too high a dose will crash estrogen. That\u2019s why you should always use the lowest effective dose and test blood levels regularly.\n\nNatural Estrogen Management (No Prescription Needed)\n\nIf you want to start naturally \u2014 or support TRT with fewer side effects \u2014 here are proven supplements:\n\nDIM (Diindolylmethane)\n\nFrom cruciferous veggies like broccoli. Supports estrogen metabolism.\n\nRecommended dose: 200\u2013300 mg/day\n\nSupports liver detox and estrogen clearance.\n\nDose: 500\u20131500 mg/day\n\nHelps boost testosterone and lightly lowers estrogen. Always pair with copper to avoid imbalance.\n\nVelvet Bean Extract (L-Dopa)\n\nIncreases dopamine and reduces prolactin \u2014 great for sex drive and mood.\n\nBonus: All of these are included in AlphaViril \u2014 which I\u2019ve personally taken for over 25 years.\n\nIt supports testosterone, balances estrogen and DHT, and enhances dopamine naturally.\n\nBut if you prefer buying ingredients individually, that works too.\n\nMost guys overlook estrogen, but it\u2019s critical \u2014 not just for erections and sex drive, but also for muscle, fat loss, mood, prostate health, and even heart health.\n\nWhether you\u2019re using testosterone or not, always test your estradiol levels. Balance is key.\n\nStart with natural support.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough, talk to your doctor about a low dose AI and make sure you monitor all 3: testosterone, estrogen (estradiol), and DHT.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "A few months ago, one of my doctor friends told me he was using a new ED drug. He claimed it worked better than Viagra alone.\n\nSo, I started doing my own research.\n\nI spoke with others who\u2019ve tried it, reviewed clinical studies, and now I\u2019m here to share the results with you.\n\nThis \u201cnew\u201d ED drug works differently from common PDE5 inhibitors like Viagra and Cialis.\n\nIn fact, HRT clinics are now combining all three into one \u201csuper erection pill.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s marketed as the holy grail of erectile dysfunction solutions.\n\nBut is that just hype?\n\nApomorphine is a dopamine agonist \u2014 a drug that mimics dopamine when your body isn\u2019t producing enough. It\u2019s gaining attention as an alternative to Viagra and Cialis.\n\nDopamine is a \u201cfeel-good\u201d neurotransmitter.\n\nIt drives reward, pleasure, motivation, and yes, sexual desire and arousal.\n\nActions like sex, porn, gambling, social media, and even food all trigger dopamine spikes. That\u2019s why you crave more of these activities.\n\nOriginally Created for Parkinson\u2019s\n\nApomorphine was originally made to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, not erectile dysfunction.\n\nParkinson\u2019s patients suffer from low dopamine and desensitized receptors, causing tremors, muscle control issues, and more.\n\nThis drug helps compensate for that loss \u2013 and that\u2019s where the ED connection comes in.\n\nHow Does Apomorphine Treat Erectile Dysfunction?\n\nErections are triggered by multiple areas of the brain, neurotransmitters, and hormones.\n\nOne of the most important?\n\nHigher dopamine levels enhance sexual arousal, motivation, and erection quality.\n\nTestosterone also plays a big role, increasing both dopamine levels and sensitivity.\n\nDopamine agonists like Apomorphine bind to D1 and D2 receptors.\n\nThis mimics natural dopamine and helps correct sexual dysfunction rooted in low dopamine or low sensitivity.\n\nApomorphine Forms & Absorption\n\nApomorphine is available as an injectable or a sublingual tablet that dissolves under the tongue.\n\nDo NOT swallow the pill \u2013 it has very low oral bioavailability and gets broken down by the liver before it can work.\n\nFDA Approval & Safety Concerns\n\nIt was previously sold under the brand name Uprima for ED, but the manufacturer withdrew the drug in 2000 due to safety issues.\n\nCompanies don\u2019t walk away from billion-dollar opportunities unless side effects are a major concern.\n\nDoes Apomorphine Work?\n\nYes \u2014 at low doses, it can help improve erections, especially for those with psychological or mild-to-moderate ED.\n\nResearch shows that 2 mg taken sublingually takes effect in 15\u201320 minutes.\n\nThat\u2019s faster than most PDE5 inhibitors like Viagra or Cialis \u2014 unless you also take those sublingually (a trick I\u2019ve shared before).\n\nApomorphine may be a good option if you:\n\nCan\u2019t tolerate PDE5 inhibitors (Viagra, Cialis)\n\nGet side effects like headaches, congestion, and a rapid heart rate\n\nDon\u2019t respond well to typical ED meds\n\nHave ED rooted in psychological issues (anxiety, stress, low libido)\n\nHowever, it\u2019s less effective than Viagra or Cialis for most men \u2014 especially if you already have moderate to severe ED.\n\nDon\u2019t Forget Testosterone\n\nMen with higher testosterone respond better to ED meds and require lower doses, which means fewer side effects.\n\nAlphaViril contains natural ingredients to:\n\nIncrease total & free testosterone\n\nBalance estrogen and DHT\n\nSupport dopamine with Velvet Bean Extract (25% L-Dopa)\n\nReduce prolactin (a hormone that kills libido and increases recovery time after orgasm)\n\nNo prescriptions or side effects. Just natural hormone optimization.\n\nThe Ultimate Drug Stack\n\nSome clinics are now combining all 3 drugs:\n\nApomorphine \u2013 for dopamine and brain stimulation\n\nViagra \u2013 for rapid blood flow\n\nCialis \u2013 for long-lasting blood flow support\n\nThis is mostly a marketing tactic.\n\nCialis takes 40\u201360 minutes to work and lasts 36 hours \u2014 it doesn\u2019t pair well with Apomorphine\u2019s short half-life (about 1 hour).\n\nApomorphine Availability & Cost\n\nApomorphine is hard to get and expensive.\n\nInjectable: $2,500 \u2013 $7,500 (for multiple doses)\n\nSublingual: $250 \u2013 $750 (for 30 tablets)\n\nYou\u2019ll likely need to go through a compounding or international pharmacy for access.\n\nSummary: Is Apomorphine Worth It?\n\nApomorphine works \u2014 but only for some men, especially those with mild ED or dopamine-related issues.\n\nIt\u2019s not as proven or effective as Viagra or Cialis.\n\nIt\u2019s expensive, prescription-only, and not FDA-approved for ED.\n\nWant a natural alternative?\n\nAlphaViril supports testosterone, dopamine, and reduces prolactin \u2014 all critical for stronger, more consistent erections.\n\nNo injections, prescriptions or side effects.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s Q&A is: Can testosterone increase penis size?\n\nNow, I\u2019m not exactly sure what that question means specifically \u2014 but I assume the real question is: \u201cCan higher levels of testosterone make your penis bigger?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll break it all down for you today.\n\nAnd, you\u2019ll find a free guide with tips on how to improve penis length, girth, and health naturally.\n\nDoes Testosterone Affect Penis Size?\n\nThe truth is: testosterone and androgens like DHT play a critical role in penis development \u2014 but only at certain stages in life.\n\nDuring fetal development\n\nThese hormones \u2014 along with genetics and even estrogen \u2014 help determine your penis size.\n\nIf you\u2019re still going through puberty, then optimizing your hormones (naturally!) could potentially maximize your growth.\n\nBut for adults? It\u2019s a different story.\n\nWhat Happens As You Get Older?\n\nAs men age, testosterone levels naturally decline and estrogen tends to rise. This can lead to:\n\nPenile shrinkage or atrophy (yes, it\u2019s real!)\n\nIt\u2019s similar to how your biceps shrink with age \u2014 unless you actively work to maintain them.\n\nWhat About Masturbation?\n\nToo much masturbation can actually create negative hormonal imbalances \u2014 such as increased prolactin and cortisol, and reduced testosterone.\n\nMany guys have told me, \u201cI think my penis is getting smaller.\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019re right \u2014 because they\u2019re overusing that \u201cmuscle.\u201d\n\nPenis Growth Is Like Going to the Gym\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nGenetics gives you your baseline\n\nHormones (like testosterone, DHT, and growth hormone) create the environment for growth\n\nExercises are the stimulus that can lead to size increases\n\nCan you grow your penis by 3 inches overnight? No.\n\nBut gaining 0.5 to 2 inches over time is possible with the right approach.\n\nBut Be Careful \u2014 You Can Overtrain\n\nJust like with lifting weights, doing too much can cause atrophy.\n\nSo follow the correct program, avoid overtraining, and be consistent.\n\nWhat\u2019s Realistically Possible?\n\nYou\u2019re probably not going to have porn star size, but you can improve what you were born with.\n\nIncreased confidence, better performance, and improved prostate health are all benefits of getting this right.\n\nCan Testosterone Alone Grow Your Penis?\n\nIf you\u2019re past puberty, testosterone by itself won\u2019t magically add size.\n\nHowever, optimizing your hormone levels will support other growth strategies like:\n\nImproved blood flow (via nitric oxide)\n\nReduced estrogen and cortisol\n\nWant to Learn the Right Way?\n\nI\u2019ve created a free, in-depth guide on how to:\n\nIncrease penis size naturally\n\nImprove erection quality\n\nBoost testosterone levels safely\n\nIt\u2019s all available below this article \u2014 no tricks, just science-backed strategies.\n\nYes, testosterone plays a role in penis growth \u2014 but mostly during puberty.\n\nFor adult men, the key is hormone optimization + proper training.\n\nCombine the right techniques with the right mindset, and you can absolutely see real improvements in size, performance, and overall male health.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7844491/",

    "content": "Today I want to talk about something I first heard about over 30 years ago \u2014 Clomid.\n\nBack then, it was mostly used in the bodybuilding world, and later on, I even talked about it with porn stars\u2026 yeah, really.\n\nI\u2019ll break it all down \u2014 how it works, why people use it, the benefits, the downsides, and how to actually use it the smart way.\n\nMy Personal Experience With Clomid\n\nI personally used Clomid about 25 years ago when I was looking to naturally boost my testosterone.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to take steroids. And after about a week or two, I noticed my testicles felt bigger and heavier.\n\nLike, blue balls level at full.\n\nI was producing so much sperm, my girlfriend joked she needed a raincoat. So, yeah\u2026 results.\n\nBut I also started getting moody.\n\nKinda down, sometimes emotional \u2014 even cried for no reason.\n\nAnd at that age, everything was going well.\n\nI didn\u2019t connect the dots at first, but over time, I realized Clomid was likely the cause.\n\nOddly enough, my sex drive went down even though my testosterone was up.\n\nSo if you\u2019re thinking about Clomid, or already on it, keep reading \u2014 I don\u2019t want you making the same mistakes I did.\n\nWhat Is Clomid and How Does It Work?\n\nClomid (Clomiphene Citrate) is an oral medication classified as a SERM \u2014 Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator.\n\nIt was originally designed for women to treat infertility by increasing ovulation.\n\nIt works by blocking estrogen receptors in the brain, which tricks your body into thinking estrogen is low.\n\nThis signals the hypothalamus to release more GnRH, which triggers the pituitary to release more LH and FSH. In women, that means egg production.\n\nIn men, it stimulates the testicles to produce more testosterone and sperm.\n\nWhy Bodybuilders and Porn Stars Use It\n\nI first heard about Clomid through bodybuilders.\n\nAfter finishing a steroid cycle, their testicles would shrink and stop producing testosterone.\n\nSo they used Clomid (along with HCG and Nolvadex) during PCT (post-cycle therapy) to \u201cwake up\u201d their balls again.\n\nLater on, when I lived in the Valley \u2014 the heart of the porn industry back in the \u201990s \u2014 I consulted with adult film actors.\n\nThey wanted to increase their ejaculation volume.\n\nI recommended Clomid for short bursts (about 5\u20137 days), which gave them noticeable results without the side effects that come from long-term use.\n\nThe Problem With Long-Term Clomid Use\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: Clomid was originally intended to be used for just 5\u201310 days in women.\n\nBut today, HRT clinics are prescribing it to men at 50 mg every day\u2026 indefinitely.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem. Taking it long-term increases the risk of:\n\nMood swings and emotional instability\n\nReduced sex drive (even if testosterone is high)\n\nEstrogen-like side effects despite estrogen being blocked\n\nResistance and adaptation \u2014 your body stops responding\n\nSerious risks like blood clots, stroke, or heart attack (rare but real)\n\nMost guys won\u2019t feel these things immediately. It creeps up after a few weeks or months.\n\nI\u2019ve had tons of guys consult with me, all saying the same thing \u2014 \u201cIt worked great at first, now I feel worse.\u201d Increasing the dose only makes it worse.\n\nSo What\u2019s the Smart Way to Use It?\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve found the best approach \u2014 and the one I used with those porn stars \u2014 is to cycle Clomid. Here\u2019s a simple protocol that works:\n\n1 week on Clomid (12.5\u201325 mg daily)\n\n3\u20136 weeks on herbal testosterone boosters\n\nThis combo works because Clomid increases total testosterone, but not always free testosterone.\n\nThe right herbs (like in Alpha Viral) help boost free testosterone, and also help balance out DHT and estrogen.\n\nThat\u2019s what keeps everything in harmony \u2014 testosterone levels, mood, libido, energy, and confidence.\n\nClomid vs. Enclomiphene (A Cleaner Version)\n\nThere are two types of Clomid: regular Clomiphene and the newer, cleaner version called Enclomiphene.\n\nThe regular version contains two isomers, and one of them tends to stick around and cause most of the moodiness and estrogenic side effects.\n\nHas a shorter half-life\n\nFewer mood or vision side effects\n\nLower dosage required (12.5\u201325 mg)\n\nThat said, there\u2019s not a lot of long-term safety data on Enclomiphene either. So my advice still stands \u2014 use it short-term only, cycle off, and support with proven herbal formulas.\n\nClomid vs. Testosterone Injections (TRT)\n\nLet\u2019s compare Clomid to testosterone injections:\n\nTRT gives faster results, sure \u2014 but once you start, it\u2019s hard to stop.\n\nYour natural production shuts down, and it\u2019s tough (and slow) to bounce back. I\u2019ve seen it take guys months to recover\u2026 if at all.\n\nConclusion: What You Should Actually Do\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about using Clomid, here\u2019s my recommendation:\n\nUse Enclomiphene if possible (cleaner version)\n\nTake it for one week max (12.5\u201325 mg daily)\n\nFollow with 3\u20136 weeks of herbal testosterone boosters\n\nRepeat as needed \u2014 but take breaks\n\nPersonally, I use Alpha Viril.\n\nI\u2019ve been taking it for over 25 years, and it works.\n\nOr just copy the ingredients and buy them separately \u2014 I really don\u2019t care.\n\nWhat matters is that it works, it\u2019s safe, and it keeps your hormones optimized.\n\nFinal tip: Don\u2019t jump into TRT injections unless you\u2019ve exhausted all other options. Once you start, it\u2019s hard to stop.\n\nClomid \u2013 when used smartly \u2013 gives you a shot at boosting testosterone naturally, keeping your testicles working, and avoiding long-term side effects.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "\"Increase My Libido & Testosterone\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb\n\nCan you actually increase your penis size by 2 inches \u2014 without surgery, pumps, or pills?\n\nAccording to Dave Asprey, yes.\n\nHe claims he achieved this using stem cell injections and shockwave therapy.\n\nA subscriber sent me this video, and in this article, I\u2019ll break down what\u2019s fact, what\u2019s fiction, and how this compares to my personal experience \u2014 and what the science actually says.\n\nDave Asprey\u2019s Claim: 2 Inches of Growth?\n\nDave Asprey has publicly claimed that he injected stem cells into his penis and saw a 2-inch increase in size \u2014 without drugs, exercises, or devices.\n\nIn addition to stem cells, he reportedly used:\n\nPRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) \u2013 for tissue regeneration\n\nShockwave Therapy \u2013 to stimulate blood flow and cellular repair\n\nHe shared a video at a biohacking conference, showing the procedure (censored), and discussed how it could help men with ED, aging tissue, and overall sexual performance \u2014 even for those without dysfunction.\n\nIs It Scientifically Possible?\n\nStem cell therapy for penile growth is still controversial.\n\nSome clinics offer it and claim success in improving both girth and length, especially when combined with shockwave therapy.\n\nNo FDA-approved studies confirm actual penis growth from stem cells\n\nThere\u2019s no published clinical evidence supporting a 2-inch increase in length\n\nThese therapies are primarily used for ED, tissue repair, and blood flow improvements\n\nIn theory, improved circulation and tissue rejuvenation could help erections feel and look fuller \u2014 especially in older men.\n\nBut permanent anatomical growth?\n\nThat\u2019s still unproven.\n\nMy Personal Experience With Stem Cells\n\nI\u2019ve had stem cells injected into both my shoulders \u2014 20 million cells each \u2014 to repair joint damage.\n\nPain reduction and mobility improvement, but absolutely no increase in size.\n\nAnd these are muscles that can grow from training \u2014 unlike the penis, which doesn\u2019t respond the same way.\n\nOne of my friends also received stem cell therapy.\n\nSame result: improved healing, zero size gain.\n\nWhy Bodybuilders Don\u2019t Use It\n\nIf stem cells actually increased size by 2 inches or 33%, athletes and bodybuilders would be using them nonstop.\n\nBodybuilders already use extreme drugs to gain tiny fractions of size\n\nIf this worked, they\u2019d be injecting stem cells into their biceps, chest, and glutes daily\n\nBut they don\u2019t \u2014 because it simply doesn\u2019t work for size gain in that way.\n\nHow Penis Growth Is Actually Possible\n\nYes, penis enlargement is possible, but it takes time and consistency.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve helped many men achieve gains of 0.5 to 2 inches \u2014 using a combination of:\n\nPenis-specific exercises\n\nTargeted supplements that improve blood flow, elasticity, and tissue health\n\nHormonal support to improve responsiveness\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to understand \u2014 this takes months, sometimes over a year.\n\nIt\u2019s gradual and not instant, but it\u2019s achievable and backed by real-world results.\n\nI\u2019ve included a free guide that shows the exact steps you can follow. It\u2019s yours to download.\n\nWhat About Growth Hormone Injections?\n\nSome people have tried injecting growth hormone directly into the penis.\n\nOne bodybuilder I know tried this for months \u2014 injecting multiple times per week.\n\nHe reported a slightly \u201cfuller\u201d look, but no real increase in size.\n\nEventually, he started combining the injections with exercises from my program.\n\nMonths later, he saw measurable improvement \u2014 about 1 inch in length and 0.5 inch in girth.\n\nHormones may help, but only when paired with exercises that actually stimulate tissue expansion \u2014 much like building muscle at the gym.\n\nThe Science of Penis Growth (and Its Limits)\n\nPenis size, like all organs and limbs, is largely genetically predetermined and influenced during two key life stages:\n\nPuberty \u2014 when hormones like testosterone and growth hormone surge\n\nOnce puberty ends and growth plates close, further natural organ growth is unlikely.\n\nStem cells in adults are primarily for repair and regeneration \u2014 not for increasing anatomical dimensions beyond your genetic set point.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Can You Really Grow Your Penis?\n\nSo, can stem cells grow your penis by 2 inches?\n\nScientifically, it\u2019s highly doubtful.\n\nThere\u2019s no peer-reviewed evidence, and even Dave Asprey hasn\u2019t shared before-and-after proof or measurements.\n\nThat said, improvements in erection quality, tissue health, and blood flow are real benefits of regenerative therapies.\n\nBut anatomical growth?\n\nThat likely comes from consistent effort using targeted exercises and supplements.\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about increasing penis size and improving performance, I made free, step-by-step guide.\n\nIt\u2019s based on years of real-world experience and thousands of success stories.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "When I consult guys about their testosterone, libido, and sex drive issues, every guy quickly focuses on how to increase their testosterone levels.\n\nWhich makes sense since testosterone makes you more \u201cmanly\u201d \u2013 physically, emotionally and sexually.\n\nHowever, before you can fix the problem, you need to know the cause.\n\nIn this case \u2014 why is your testosterone low? Why do you have a low drive?\n\nSadly, most guys don\u2019t realize that some of the most popular prescription drugs, including over-the-counter ones, can lower testosterone and cause erectile problems.\n\nTop Medications That Lower Testosterone & Cause ED\n\nWith that said, here are 10 popular medications that can lower testosterone levels and contribute to erectile dysfunction.\n\n1. NSAIDs (e.g., Ibuprofen, Naproxen) and Erectile Dysfunction\n\nStudy Findings: A 2011 study in The Journal of Urology found that regular NSAID use (\u22652x/week) was associated with a 22% increased risk of ED.\n\nMechanism: NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandins, which are crucial for vasodilation and blood flow.\n\n2. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and Testosterone Suppression\n\nNot technically an NSAID, but still impacts prostaglandin pathways.\n\nHormonal Impact: High doses may disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, reducing testosterone.\n\nLiver Stress: Chronic use affects liver function, which is essential for hormone metabolism.\n\n3. Blood Pressure Medications (Antihypertensives)\n\nBeta-blockers: (e.g., Metoprolol, Propranolol) \u2013 May impair penile blood flow and cause low libido.\n\nDiuretics: (e.g., Hydrochlorothiazide) \u2013 Deplete zinc and reduce testosterone levels.\n\nCalcium channel blockers: (e.g., Amlodipine) \u2013 Some users report erectile problems.\n\nACE inhibitors: (e.g., Lisinopril) \u2013 Mild effects on erectile function but still worth monitoring.\n\n4. Antidepressants & Psychiatric Medications\n\nSSRIs: (e.g., Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, Paxil) \u2013 Reduce libido, delay orgasm, and cause ED. Paxil is the worst offender.\n\nSNRIs: (e.g., Effexor, Cymbalta) \u2013 Have similar sexual side effects as SSRIs.\n\nTCAs: (e.g., Amitriptyline) \u2013 May reduce nerve function and blood flow.\n\nAntipsychotics: (e.g., Risperdal, Zyprexa, Haldol) \u2013 Increase prolactin, which suppresses testosterone and libido.\n\n5. Opioids and Pain Medications\n\nOpioids: (e.g., Oxycodone, Morphine, Fentanyl) \u2013 Cause opioid-induced hypogonadism by lowering testosterone production.\n\nCombined use with NSAIDs or Tylenol: Further reduces blood flow and testosterone levels.\n\n6. Hormonal Medications\n\nFinasteride & Dutasteride: (Propecia, Avodart) \u2013 Block DHT; known to cause low libido, ED, and even post-finasteride syndrome (PFS).\n\nCorticosteroids: (e.g., Prednisone) \u2013 Can suppress testosterone in just a few days.\n\n7. Anti-seizure & Nerve Pain Medications\n\nGabapentin, Pregabalin: May blunt dopamine and reduce nerve sensitivity, lowering sexual arousal.\n\nTopiramate: Often used for migraines or epilepsy \u2014 may reduce libido.\n\n8. Statins (Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs)\n\nExamples include Lipitor, Zocor.\n\nStatins lower cholesterol \u2014 but since testosterone is made from cholesterol, these drugs can lower hormone production.\n\n9. H2 Blockers (Acid Reducers)\n\nExamples: Ranitidine (Zantac), Cimetidine (Tagamet).\n\nTagamet in particular can lower testosterone and raise estrogen levels.\n\n10. Blood Sugar Lowering Drugs\n\nMetformin: Suppresses LH and testosterone, lowers sperm count, raises SHBG (which binds to testosterone).\n\nTZDs: (e.g., Actos, Avandia) \u2013 Raise SHBG and lower free testosterone.\n\nYou\u2019re Probably Taking One of These Drugs\n\nSadly, I know so many people who are taking at least one of these drugs regularly or many times a week.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not here to tell you to stop taking your medications. You\u2019ll need to speak to your doctor about this.\n\nSometimes there are alternative drugs, but those will usually have similar negatives since they accomplish a similar goal, using a similar unnatural pathway.\n\nNatural Alternatives to Consider\n\nI\u2019ve listed natural herbal remedies below if you want to try safer solutions.\n\nHowever, supplements can never replace drugs because drugs are very powerful. Unfortunately, they also have lots of negative side effects and can be addictive.\n\nOn the other hand, most people also do NOT need drugs. It\u2019s just the medical system immediately wants to prescribe you a drug since that\u2019s what they\u2019re taught in school \u2014 and the whole system is run by big pharma.\n\nWhat You Actually Need: Lifestyle Fixes\n\nWhat we need to do is improve our lifestyle: eating better, moving more, sleeping better, and adding nutrients we might be lacking \u2014 since nobody has the perfect diet.\n\nSummary: Stop the Damage Before It Gets Worse\n\nIncreasing your testosterone levels is a great idea, and I\u2019ve made a lot of different videos about it in the past.\n\nHowever, just as important \u2014 maybe even more \u2014 is reducing or eliminating the drugs that lower testosterone and cause erectile dysfunction.\n\nBecause the older we get, the worse the problems become and the more damage these drugs can cause over time.\n\nRemember, your body is not deficient in a synthetic drug. It\u2019s lacking nutrients, movement, and a healthy lifestyle.\n\nWatch the full video above to learn more and check the natural options to help you start restoring your testosterone \u2014 the right way.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "\"Increase My Libido & Testosterone\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb\n\nToday\u2019s topic is extremely important \u2014 what\u2019s the best ED pill for harder and bigger erections, based on the latest clinical studies?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for erections on demand, this article is perfect for you.\n\nI\u2019ll cover which drugs are most effective, based on science, and also share some personal experiences and practical tips.\n\nReal-Life Example: Why This Matters\n\nRecently, I received an email from a man trying to get his wife pregnant.\n\nA year ago, his testosterone was only 382.\n\nAfter following my advice, it\u2019s now up to 807, and his sperm quality has improved.\n\nHe takes Alpha Viril, Vitamin D & K, fish oil, magnesium, and zinc.\n\nHis erections are better \u2014 but there\u2019s a problem.\n\nDue to his wife\u2019s ovulation timing, he sometimes struggles to get an erection on command.\n\nStress and fatigue don\u2019t help. So, he asked about using an ED drug like Viagra or Cialis, and which one works best.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown.\n\nUnderstanding ED Pills (PDE5 Inhibitors)\n\nThere are 4\u20135 common ED drugs.\n\nThese are known as PDE5 inhibitors, and they work by increasing blood flow to the penis.\n\nOriginally designed to lower blood pressure, they require sexual stimulation (mental or physical) to work \u2014 they won\u2019t cause erections on their own.\n\nImportant Note: These drugs work better when your testosterone levels are higher.\n\nIn fact, around 40% of men don\u2019t respond to ED drugs due to low testosterone. The younger you are, the better they tend to work.\n\nDifferences in Half-Life & Onset\n\nThe biggest difference between these drugs is their half-life \u2014 how long they stay in your system \u2014 and how quickly they take effect.\n\nViagra & Levitra: Half-life of 4\u20136 hours, onset in ~30 minutes. Viagra works best on an empty stomach.\n\nStendra: Half-life of 6\u201310 hours, onset in ~15 minutes. Can be taken with food.\n\nCialis: Longest half-life: 24\u201336 hours. Onset time ~45\u201360 minutes. Ideal for weekend use or consistent readiness.\n\nIf you take 50 mg of Viagra at 8:00 AM, about 25 mg remains in your system 4\u20136 hours later.\n\nEven after 8\u201312 hours, a smaller amount is still active.\n\nThe same principle applies to Cialis, which can stay in your body for up to two days.\n\nTip: Take on an Empty Stomach\n\nAlthough some can be taken with food, they all work best on an empty stomach.\n\nIdeally, wait 2 hours after eating and 30\u201360 minutes before your next meal.\n\nFor faster absorption, grind the pill and let it dissolve under your tongue. This bypasses the digestive system and speeds up effects.\n\nClinical Study Results\n\nA large meta-analysis compared the effectiveness across the most common ED pills:\n\nViagra (50 mg): 47% improvement in erections\n\nLevitra (10 mg): 35% improvement\n\nCialis (10 mg): 33% improvement\n\nStendra (100 mg): 29% improvement\n\nThese were average doses \u2014 not maximum \u2014 but Viagra ranked highest in overall effectiveness.\n\nPotential Side Effects\n\nCommon side effects include:\n\nNote: A friend of mine collapsed and hit his head due to a sudden blood pressure drop \u2014 so be careful, especially when combining with alcohol or other meds.\n\nWhich Has the Fewest Side Effects?\n\nCialis (10 mg) had the lowest rate of side effects at 10%, while Viagra had the highest at 18%.\n\nThis makes sense since Cialis is a slower-acting medication with a more gradual effect.\n\nWhich ED Pill Should You Choose?\n\nWhile I can\u2019t offer medical advice, here\u2019s what to consider:\n\nNeed fast results? Try Viagra or Stendra\n\nWant all-day or weekend readiness? Go with Cialis\n\nSensitive to side effects? Start with the lowest dose of Cialis\n\nEveryone responds differently.\n\nSome prefer Viagra, others Cialis.\n\nAlways start with the lowest dose and increase only if needed. It saves money and helps you avoid unnecessary side effects.\n\nAdditional Tips & Warnings\n\nDon\u2019t use ED drugs daily \u2014 your body will adapt, reducing effectiveness.\n\nCycling between drugs (e.g., Viagra one week, Cialis another) may help.\n\nTestosterone optimization improves ED drug response.\n\nDon\u2019t become psychologically dependent \u2014 use ED drugs as needed, not as a crutch.\n\nFinally, boosting your testosterone naturally will enhance results.\n\nWhether you\u2019re trying to conceive or simply want reliable performance, ED medications can help \u2014 but use them wisely and sparingly.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today, it\u2019s 2025 and I want to talk about what may be the most powerful legal testosterone booster available \u2014 HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin).\n\nI\u2019ll explain how it works, the benefits, side effects, and how it\u2019s used by everyone from bodybuilders and porn stars to regular men trying to improve fertility or support TRT.\n\nHCG is a hormone naturally produced in the body, especially during pregnancy.\n\nIn fact, pregnancy tests detect HCG levels in urine or blood to confirm pregnancy.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure whether you have real HCG, you can apply a drop to a pregnancy test strip \u2014 if it shows positive, it\u2019s legit.\n\nUnfortunately, HCG has become very expensive \u2014 around $300 per vial \u2014 even though it used to be far more affordable.\n\nHCG is administered via injection and works similarly to Clomid by signaling the body to produce more testosterone, but HCG is injectable, while Clomid is oral.\n\nMedically, HCG is used to:\n\nInduce ovulation in women as part of fertility treatments\n\nStimulate testosterone and sperm production in men with low testosterone\n\nHelp testicles descend in young boys with undescended testes\n\nCommon Side Effects & Warnings\n\nImportant: This is not medical advice. Always consult your doctor before using hormone-based therapies.\n\nDespite raising testosterone, HCG can cause the following side effects:\n\nFatigue or irritability\n\nMood swings or mild depression\n\nIncreased hair loss (via DHT)\n\nGynecomastia (breast tenderness or growth in men)\n\nWhy does this happen?\n\nHCG tends to spike testosterone and then convert more of it into estrogen and DHT \u2014 especially in older men or those with higher body fat.\n\nThis can lead to a hormone imbalance if not managed correctly.\n\nSigns of high estrogen may include moodiness, water retention, sensitive nipples, or breast discomfort.\n\nYou can also confirm via blood tests (check estradiol, testosterone, LH, and FSH levels).\n\nHow Bodybuilders Use HCG\n\nIn the bodybuilding world, HCG is commonly used to restore testicular size and function after steroid or testosterone use.\n\nSteroids shut down natural testosterone production, causing testicles to shrink.\n\nTo recover, bodybuilders typically do a post-cycle therapy (PCT) using:\n\nA smarter method is to prevent shrinkage by using small HCG doses during the steroid or TRT cycle \u2014 such as 250 IU, 2\u20133 times per week.\n\nThis helps maintain natural testosterone production and testicular size.\n\nHowever: Combining TRT with HCG increases the need to manage estrogen and DHT using aromatase inhibitors (e.g., Arimidex), which can introduce new complications like hair loss or prostate issues.\n\nHow Porn Stars Use HCG\n\nIn the 1990s, I met several porn actors who used HCG to increase ejaculation volume and boost libido.\n\nWhile Clomid was often used in short 5\u20137 day cycles followed by herbs, HCG gave stronger, faster results.\n\nTypical protocol: 2,500 IU of HCG taken 2\u20133 days before a shoot.\n\nHeavier, fuller testicles\n\nIncreased sperm volume\n\nHeightened sexual drive and performance\n\nHowever, these results often came with discomfort from testicular fullness \u2014 a sensation like \u201cblue balls\u201d that could last all day.\n\nRecommended Usage Strategy\n\nThe best way to use HCG is to cycle it smartly:\n\nFollow with 3\u20136 weeks of natural herbal testosterone boosters\n\nThis helps maintain testosterone levels without excessive estrogen buildup.\n\nMany of my clients use AlphaViril during the off weeks \u2014 not only for testosterone but also to balance DHT, estrogen, and dopamine.\n\nDopamine plays a major role in sex drive.\n\nOver time, as dopamine levels drop (in relationships or with aging), desire and motivation fade.\n\nPorn stars often use dopamine-boosting herbs and amino acids to stay mentally \u201cin the mood.\u201d\n\nAlphaViril contains Velvet Bean Extract, which provides L-DOPA \u2014 a precursor to dopamine.\n\nMany of my clients find this helps reignite their sex drive naturally, especially when combined with HCG or Clomid.\n\nHCG can be incredibly effective \u2013 but only when used correctly and in moderation.\n\nI always recommend starting with natural solutions like AlphaViril or short Clomid cycles before considering injections or full-blown testosterone replacement therapy (TRT).\n\nOnce you\u2019re on TRT, it\u2019s often a lifelong commitment with many moving parts \u2014 including managing testicles, estrogen, DHT, and mental drive.\n\nSo use HCG strategically, and go natural for as long as possible.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "There\u2019s a natural food \u2014 backed by science, animal studies, and real user feedback in 2025 \u2014 that may help increase your testicle size and boost testosterone.\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not a gimmick or a supplement scam.\n\nThe Surprising Question Men Keep Asking\n\nOver a dozen guys have recently asked: \u201cCan I naturally increase the size of my testicles \u2014 and will it boost sperm count and testosterone too?\u201d\n\nAnd best of all, it\u2019s completely natural and offers bonus benefits for overall health and longevity.\n\nTrue Story: The Porn Star Protocol\n\nYears ago, when I used to consult adult film actors who wanted bigger loads for performance on camera, I would prescribe a short cycle of Clomid or HCG.\n\nTheir semen volume increased \u2014 sometimes too much, leading to painful blue balls.\n\nBut today, HRT clinics often prescribe these drugs year-round, which is a terrible idea.\n\nLong-term use can cause blood clots, heart attacks, or strokes.\n\nThe Shocking Study That Started It All\n\nResearchers made a surprising discovery when testing mice with a specific type of yogurt containing a probiotic called Lactobacillus reuteri (L. Reuteri).\n\nTesticles grew by 15%\n\nAnd yes, it was directly tied to the presence of L. Reuteri in their gut.\n\nBut Does It Work in Humans?\n\nMouse studies don\u2019t always match human biology \u2014 but in this case, there\u2019s promising evidence.\n\nHuman studies show L. Reuteri may support:\n\nImproved semen quality\n\nIncreased testosterone levels\n\nLower inflammation (IL-17)\n\nImproved digestion and gut lining\n\nReduced obesity and autoimmune issues\n\nBack in the 1960s, 40% of people had this healthy bacterium.\n\nToday? Only 10\u201315%. That could explain a lot of men\u2019s modern health problems.\n\nWhy Yogurt Doesn\u2019t Work Anymore\n\nDon\u2019t just grab yogurt off the shelf \u2014 most American yogurts only contain 2\u20135 strains of bacteria, and L. Reuteri is rarely one of them.\n\nThe Better Option: Kefir\n\nKefir [kuh-feer] is a fermented milk drink with more diverse probiotic strains, including L. Reuteri.\n\nIt\u2019s typically made from cow, goat, or sheep milk.\n\nTips for Best Results:\n\nChoose goat or sheep milk kefir for better casein compatibility\n\nAvoid sweetened or flavored versions \u2013 sugar kills probiotic benefits\n\nMake sure L. Reuteri is on the label\n\nWhat About Supplements?\n\nSome people prefer probiotic pills.\n\nIf you go that route, you MUST find the L. Reuteri strain ATCC PTA 6475 on the label.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem \u2014 a randomized controlled trial showed no significant testosterone increases in men (ages 50\u201365) after 12 weeks of L. Reuteri supplements.\n\nBottom line: Skip the pills and stick to real kefir for the most benefits.\n\nHow to Use Kefir for Best Results\n\nDrink 1 cup daily for at least 3 months.\n\nIt\u2019s not a quick fix \u2014 but the long-term benefits are worth it.\n\nReal Feedback From Users\n\nMany men who followed this protocol shared in the comments:\n\nImproved energy and libido\n\nNoticeably fuller testicles\n\nDon\u2019t Like the Taste?\n\nIf you don\u2019t like kefir, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 I don\u2019t either.\n\nThat\u2019s why I personally use a blend of herbs and vitamins that work faster and improve erection quality too.\n\nI\u2019ve used it for 25+ years, and thousands of men have had great results.\n\nBonus: How to Make Kefir at Home (Save Money!)\n\nGet kefir grains (starter culture \u2013 online or health stores)\n\nUse 1\u20132 tbsp of grains + 2 cups of milk (goat/sheep/cow \u2013 preferably whole)\n\nPut it in a glass jar and cover with cheesecloth or a paper towel\n\nLet it ferment at room temp (65\u201385\u00b0F) for 24\u201348 hours\n\nStrain the grains and store the finished kefir in a glass bottle in the fridge\n\nThe grains are reusable indefinitely, so you can keep making batch after batch at home.\n\nBigger testicles. Higher testosterone. Better orgasms. Improved health.\n\nAll from one simple daily habit \u2014 kefir.\n\nAnd if you really don\u2019t like the taste, you can do what I do \u2013 take natural herbs and vitamins to boost testosterone and libido.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "3 Foods To Boost Your Testosterone & Libido In 2025",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/3-proven-foods-to-boost-your-testosterone-libido/",
    "content": "Sadly, now it\u2019s 2025 and most of the foods we eat today actually lowers testosterone levels.\n\nThis could explain why the average man\u2019s testosterone is about half what it was 50 years ago.\n\nThe culprit? Diet, lifestyle, and nutrient-deficient food.\n\nBut the good news is that there are 3 clinically backed foods that naturally support higher testosterone, stronger erections, increased libido, and improved body composition.\n\nThey taste good, are easy to find, and work in both studies and real-world results.\n\nFor over 25 years, I\u2019ve helped men naturally improve testosterone, sex drive, energy, and body composition \u2014 starting with my own hormonal imbalances at just 19.\n\nNow in my 50s, my testosterone is still high \u2014 and these foods are part of why.\n\n1. Whole Eggs (Pasture-Raised)\n\nWhole eggs are the #1 testosterone-boosting food I recommend \u2014 specifically pasture-raised eggs with bright yellow yolks.\n\nThe yolk contains cholesterol, which is the building block for testosterone production.\n\nTestosterone, DHEA, and other key sex hormones are made from cholesterol, and low-cholesterol diets or statins often lead to low libido and erectile problems.\n\nEggs also provide a perfect combination of high-quality protein and healthy fats that raise your body\u2019s good HDL cholesterol, not harmful LDL.\n\nStudy results: In a 12-week study with resistance-trained men (avg. age 24), those who ate 3 whole eggs post-workout saw a 240 ng/dL increase in testosterone compared to just 70 ng/dL in the egg-white group \u2014 that\u2019s over 3.5x more.\n\nFat loss: -2.7% body fat (vs. -1.7% in egg-white group)\n\nMuscle strength: 11.2% improvement in knee extension (vs. 8.6%)\n\nMy protocol: I eat 3 whole eggs daily, usually at night.\n\nWhy? Your body produces testosterone overnight, and cholesterol is needed for that process \u2014 so consuming it before bed works better for me.\n\nPlus, eggs are low-carb and easy to digest.\n\n2. Grass-Fed Red Meat (Especially Bison)\n\nRed meat \u2014 especially grass-fed beef or bison \u2014 is a testosterone powerhouse.\n\nIt\u2019s rich in saturated fats, cholesterol, zinc, iron, and other micronutrients essential for hormone production and muscle growth.\n\nOld-school bodybuilders like Arnold Schwarzenegger swore by \u201csteak and eggs\u201d \u2014 and they built size with minimal steroid use compared to today\u2019s standards.\n\nIt\u2019s leaner, cleaner, and contains more nutrients than standard beef.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford bison, opt for grass-fed beef, which has a better fat profile and fewer hormones compared to grain-fed alternatives.\n\nPlus, red meat keeps you full, supports lean mass, and has been shown to raise testosterone in men with low intake of animal fats.\n\n3. Oysters (Or Zinc Supplements)\n\nOysters have long been known as a natural aphrodisiac \u2014 and for good reason.\n\nThey\u2019re the most concentrated food source of zinc, a mineral that plays a critical role in testosterone production, sperm quality, and libido.\n\nReduces estrogen (less fat gain, less gynecomastia)\n\nLowers DHT (reduces hair loss and prostate risk)\n\nImproves testosterone output and hormone balance\n\nUnfortunately, many people are deficient in zinc \u2014 especially if they eat a plant-based diet or don\u2019t consume enough seafood or red meat.\n\nNeither do I. That\u2019s why I recommend taking a zinc supplement with copper to avoid deficiency symptoms like fatigue, white/gray hair, and brain fog.\n\nRecommended zinc-to-copper ratio: 10\u201315 mg of zinc to 1 mg of copper. Too much zinc without copper can create an imbalance and lead to neurological issues.\n\nI personally use a supplement that combines zinc, copper, and 12 other ingredients clinically proven to support testosterone, libido, and erection quality.\n\nThere\u2019s no magic food that will boost your testosterone overnight.\n\nBut if you consistently include the right nutrients \u2014 like eggs, grass-fed meat, and zinc \u2014 you\u2019ll notice real, sustainable changes in energy, drive, performance, and body composition.\n\nThese 3 foods are a core part of my diet, and I\u2019ve seen the results in my own bloodwork \u2014 including a total testosterone level of 1,157 ng/dL in my 50s (up from 992 a year earlier).\n\nYes, lifestyle, sleep, and supplements matter \u2014 but food is the foundation.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a natural, sustainable way to improve your hormones, start with what\u2019s on your plate.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025, and we\u2019re going to cover 10 critical things you should never do to your penis \u2014 if you care about your health, confidence, and sex life.\n\nThis isn\u2019t clickbait \u2014 it\u2019s real, practical, and potentially life-changing.\n\n1. Don\u2019t Ignore Erectile Dysfunction\n\nIf your erections aren\u2019t as strong as they used to be, it\u2019s not just about sex \u2014 it could be a warning sign of heart disease, poor blood flow, blood sugar issues, high blood pressure, or hormonal imbalances.\n\nGet your hormones, blood sugar, and cardiovascular health checked.\n\nA simple blood test is a great start. ED is often the \u201ccanary in the coal mine.\u201d\n\n2. Urination Warnings\n\nFrequent urination, especially at night, or a weakening urine stream can signal prostate issues \u2014 from inflammation to cancer.\n\nGet a prostate exam and blood tests (PSA, testosterone, estrogen, DHT). Prostate problems are very treatable when caught early.\n\n3. Don\u2019t Neglect Hygiene\n\nPoor hygiene can lead to infections, bad odor, and turn your partner off \u2014 especially if you\u2019re uncircumcised.\n\nWash gently with mild soap and warm water.\n\nClean under the foreskin if applicable. Twice daily if uncircumcised.\n\n4. Don\u2019t Ignore Pain, Lumps, or Ulcers\n\nAny unusual swelling, pain, or sores should not be ignored.\n\nIt could be an STI, urinary issue, or, in rare cases, cancer.\n\nSee a doctor immediately. Early detection = better outcomes.\n\n5. Don\u2019t Skip Protection or Go Too Hard\n\nUnprotected sex risks disease and pregnancy. And yes, you can fracture your penis during rough sex.\n\nUse condoms and lubrication.\n\nIf something pops or swells painfully, get to the ER fast.\n\n6. Don\u2019t Overheat the Goods\n\nYour testicles need to stay cool to produce sperm and testosterone. Heat throws that off.\n\nAvoid prolonged exposure to hot tubs, saunas, or heat from laptops and phones.\n\nIce packs during saunas can help.\n\n7. Don\u2019t Use the \u2018Death Grip\u2019\n\nAggressive masturbation reduces sensitivity, making it harder to enjoy real sex.\n\nUse lubrication and go gentler.\n\nMimic real sex to avoid unrealistic pressure conditioning.\n\n8. Don\u2019t Smoke (Ever)\n\nSmoking destroys blood flow, testosterone, and bladder health. It\u2019s a direct route to erectile dysfunction.\n\nFor your erections, if not your heart.\n\n9. Don\u2019t Beat Yourself Up\n\nPerformance anxiety kills confidence.\n\nComparing yourself to porn or others only makes things worse.\n\nTalk to a therapist or urologist if needed. One bad night doesn\u2019t define your manhood.\n\n10. Don\u2019t Stop Using It\n\nNo erections \u2014 including morning wood \u2014 can lead to penile tissue hardening and shrinkage.\n\nOptimize testosterone and hormone levels.\n\nKeep your drive and erections alive. Regular erections are vital for penile health.\n\nHere are my favorite resources to help you improve hormones, erections, and overall penile health.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

LOL\u2026\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s dig into this and help grow back your penis, so you can feel more confident.\n\nYes, the Penis Can Shrink With Age\n\nHowever, penis shrinkage can happen even when you\u2019re younger \u2014 in your 20s and 30s. Let\u2019s go over the most common causes:\n\n1. Hormonal Imbalance\n\nThis is one of the biggest causes of penis shrinkage.\n\nAs you age, your testosterone levels decrease and estrogen increases, creating a hormonal imbalance.\n\nThe penis is still a muscle \u2014 different than your biceps, but still influenced by testosterone, which supports growth and strength.\n\nFun fact: Female bodybuilders who take testosterone often develop clitoral growth \u2014 sometimes up to 2 inches long. That\u2019s because the clitoris is similar to the penis in structure, just without the urethra.\n\nOptimizing your testosterone levels won\u2019t make your penis grow beyond your genetic potential, but it can restore your full size and firmness.\n\nAging reduces blood flow and circulation throughout the body \u2014 including the penis. Poor circulation affects erection strength, size, and fullness.\n\nPenis exercises, amino acids, and blood flow supplements can help restore healthy circulation and maximize your full size potential.\n\n3. Gaining Belly Fat (Cosmetic Shrinkage)\n\nExcess fat around the belly and pubic area makes the penis appear smaller.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than just appearance \u2014 fat cells increase estrogen production, which reduces testosterone and causes real shrinkage over time.\n\nResearch from 2014 found that 15\u201368% of patients experienced shrinkage after prostate gland removal (prostatectomy).\n\nThe good news? Many of these men regained some size within 1\u20132 years using penis rehabilitation exercises.\n\n5-alpha reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride (used for hair loss or prostate issues) are known to:\n\nCause erectile dysfunction\n\nIncrease estrogen and lower testosterone\n\nThese drugs are anti-androgens and can have long-term sexual side effects.\n\n6. \u201cUse It Or Lose It\u201d\n\nThe penis is a muscle \u2014 and if you don\u2019t use it, you lose it.\n\nHowever, masturbating too often can also cause shrinkage due to stress and overstimulation. Think of it like overtraining a muscle \u2014 it becomes fatigued and starts to atrophy.\n\nKeep using it, get regular erections, and do your kegels, but avoid overdoing it.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ve included two important links if you want to restore your penis size and improve your erection quality:\n\nNatural Testosterone Optimization Solution \u2013 Use this daily to naturally increase testosterone and balance estrogen and cortisol levels.\n\nFree penis growth guide \u2013 Includes the best exercises, routines, and strategies to increase length, girth, and erection strength.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 now, and these days, testosterone is a big topic, especially with the rise of TRT and HRT clinics.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the information out there is incorrect or made up.\n\nSome popular influencer, podcast, or YouTuber says something\u2026 and then everyone else repeats the same junk. It\u2019s the blind leading the blind.\n\nEven I\u2019ve fallen for some of these testosterone myths.\n\nWith my background in endocrinology and over two decades of consulting athletes, bodybuilders, and everyday guys, today I\u2019m going to quickly expose the top 10 common myths about testosterone.\n\nMyth #1: Testosterone Is Just About Sex Drive\n\nSure, testosterone impacts libido and erections.\n\nBut it also plays a huge role in muscle mass, body fat, mood, motivation, memory, and cardiovascular health.\n\nLow T isn\u2019t just a bedroom issue\u2014it\u2019s a whole-body issue.\n\nSo if you\u2019re feeling tired, weak, depressed, or losing muscle\u2026 it might not be \u201cjust aging.\u201d It could be low testosterone.\n\nMyth #2: High Testosterone Is Bad or Dangerous\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve heard that high testosterone causes cancer, heart attacks, mood swings, and mental problems.\n\nThe reality? Naturally high testosterone is extremely beneficial for your brain, mood, muscle mass, heart, prostate, metabolism, and more.\n\nThe real danger is in how testosterone converts into estrogen and DHT. Poorly executed TRT\u2014not testosterone itself\u2014is the true issue.\n\nMyth #3: Only Older Men Have Low Testosterone\n\nToday, even men as young as 20 experience low T due to:\n\nPlastics and endocrine disruptors\n\nUse of drugs, including marijuana, antidepressants, sleeping meds, and alcohol\n\nTestosterone isn\u2019t just about age\u2014it\u2019s about lifestyle.\n\nMyth #4: Natural Boosters Don\u2019t Work\n\nMost testosterone boosters are garbage, but certain natural ingredients\u2014like tongkat ali, ashwagandha, fenugreek, boron, tribulus, and horny goat weed \u2013 do have clinical research backing them.\n\nWhen combined correctly, they work, especially when they also help balance estrogen, DHT, cortisol, dopamine, and prolactin.\n\nI\u2019ve used AlphaViril for over 25 years with guaranteed results or your money back plus $100 cash.\n\nMyth #5: Low Testosterone Is Part Of Aging\n\nWhile testosterone does decline with age, low T in older men isn\u2019t normal.\n\nMy recent blood test showed a level of 1057 \u2013 in my 50s.\n\nMany clients in their 40s to 70s have doubled or tripled their T levels naturally. You may not reach your 20s peak, but you shouldn\u2019t be in the low range either.\n\nMyth #6: High Testosterone Causes Aggression or \u201cRoid\u201d Rage\n\nLow testosterone is more often linked to irritability and depression.\n\n\u201cRoid rage\u201d is mostly connected to extremely high doses of certain steroids, not testosterone itself.\n\nHigh estrogen, not testosterone, has been linked to increased aggression.\n\nMyth #7: Testosterone Makes You Go Bald\n\nHair loss is largely genetic.\n\nThe real issue isn\u2019t testosterone\u2014it\u2019s DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a variant of testosterone.\n\nHigher DHT = more hair loss.\n\nIronically, TRT can worsen hair loss due to flawed protocols.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in preventing balding, let me know \u2013 I may create a video about it.\n\nMyth #8: \u201cIf Your Total Testosterone Is Normal, That\u2019s All That Matters\u201d\n\nFree testosterone, SHBG, estradiol, DHT, cortisol levels, and symptoms all matter.\n\nYou can have \u201cnormal\u201d testosterone and still feel terrible, or have low libido and performance.\n\nMyth #9: Testosterone Causes Prostate Cancer\n\nThis outdated myth still persists.\n\nIf high testosterone caused prostate cancer, teenagers would be most at risk\u2014not older men with low T.\n\nHigh estrogen and imbalanced DHT/testosterone ratios.\n\nHealthy hormone balance \u2013 not just low T \u2013 is key for prostate health.\n\nAlphaViril was designed to raise testosterone while reducing excess estrogen, prolactin, and DHT to optimize hormone ratios.\n\nMyth #10: You Need To Inject Testosterone To Raise It\n\nYou don\u2019t need injections.\n\nSure, they\u2019re the fastest method, but they also risk the most side effects when mismanaged.\n\nTRT clinics often prioritize profits over your health. Before even considering TRT:\n\nUse proven supplements, vitamins, and minerals\n\nReduce testosterone-killing drugs like pot and alcohol\n\nIf you still have low testosterone afterward, then consider TRT. A healthy body responds better to lower TRT doses with fewer side effects.\n\nThe problem with social media is that there\u2019s too much information, and a lot of it is wrong.\n\nMost people want less noise, but more clarity.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m creating a short Testosterone Blueprint guide \u2013 it covers lifestyle, diet, supplements, blood tests, drugs, and everything else you need to know.\n\nIt\u2019s free for my subscribers and should be ready soon.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to discuss the top 5 popular prescription drugs that lower sex drive in both men and women, while also causing erectile problems in guys.\n\nI need to give a legal disclaimer; you should always speak to your doctor before you do anything. I\u2019m just sharing facts with you.\n\nHypertension (Anti-Hypertensive)\n\nHigh blood pressure is such a big problem that there are almost a dozen different types of drugs that help lower blood pressure.\n\nAlpha & Beta-blockers\n\nAngiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)\n\nCalcium channel blockers\n\nAdrenergic inhibitors\n\nSadly, most of them cause some sort of libido and erectile problems. And combining 2 or more of them, as do many doctors, obviously makes this situation worse.\n\nAgain, aging is a big cause. A better diet, exercise the specific herbs & vitamins can make a big difference.\n\nCorticosteroids / Stimulants\n\nThese are drugs that mimic stress hormones. You\u2019ve probably heard of cortisol, which is a stress hormone and that\u2019s what these drugs replicate or activate in the body.\n\nUnfortunately, as stress hormones such as cortisol, increase your adrenal production, while decreasing testosterone production.\n\nTestosterone is the primary hormone in both men and women that controls your sex drive \u2013 physically, mentally and emotionally.\n\nIn men, testosterone helps improve erections and in women, it increases clitoral sensitivity.\n\nSome of the more popular corticoid drugs are:\n\nAlso, anything that increases adrenaline, also increases cortisol. Thus, taking any stimulant type of drug will also cause negative sexual effects\n\nThese can be ADHD drugs such as\n\nEven taking too much caffeine, pre-workout supplements, and similar uppers all increase cortisol and will decrease testosterone.\n\nSo, at the very least, you need to decrease your cortisol levels, especially at night, if you want to continue taking stimulants.\n\nLuckily you can improve cortisol levels naturally, using specific herbs and vitamins.\n\nI was shocked to find that around 25% of the population is taking antidepressants.\n\nAnd during the recent problems in our world that we\u2019ve all been dealing with and our health, there\u2019s been a sharp increase in the use of antidepressant drugs.\n\nOne of the issues these drugs cause is linked to serotonin, which then decreases dopamine, which then decreases both sexual drive and performance in the bedroom.\n\nSome of the more popular drugs you\u2019ve probably heard of are\n\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \u2013 SSRI (Lexapro, Prozac)\n\nNoradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (Wellbutrin, Zyban)\n\ntricyclic antidepressants (Pamelor)\n\nThis also leads us to another set of similar drugs, which are:\n\nAnti-Anxiety (Benzodiazepines)\n\nMany doctors will prescribe these drugs along with or in replacement of antidepressants.\n\nThese tend to act as tranquilizers in the body to treat problems such as\n\nSome of the more popular and common drugs are\n\nclonazepam (Klonopin)\n\nBy the way, I had once taken a very low dose of Xanax at 0.25 mgs at night to help me sleep. To help my mind and body relax.\n\nI\u2019ve never been a good sleeper and it was fantastic.\n\nHowever, the next day I was tired, felt very \u201cblah\u201d, unmotivated, I didn\u2019t feel like working, going to the gym or doing anything really\n\nAnd yes, ZERO sex drive and it was impossible to get an erection.\n\nI stopped using it within a week and found natural herbal alternatives that help improve GABA levels and serotonin, but without any of the negative or sexual side effects.\n\nSo if you\u2019re dealing some feelings of anxiety or sadness, I totally understand. I\u2019ve been there. But for most people, drugs cause other negative side effects.\n\nThat\u2019s why I use natural herbs instead, to improve my mood and happiness.\n\nCholesterol / Statin / Fibrates\n\nMany cholesterol-lowering drugs cause erectile problems in addition to lots of other issues \u2014 such as muscle pain and loss, memory problems, liver issues, fatigue, lowered mood and so forth.\n\nThese are usually statin and fibrate drugs.\n\nThis is because cholesterol is required for the production of many sex hormones \u2013 such as testosterone and estrogens.\n\nAny many studies have shown that BOTH men and women who take these drugs, have lowered sexual desire, difficulty achieving an orgasm and in men \u2013 difficulty in getting erections.\n\nThe goal is to have healthy cholesterol in a youthful range. Not high or low.\n\nHowever, the cause of these problems from the use of drugs is that they lower your cholesterol and lipids unnaturally. They don\u2019t work WITH your body and thus, the negative effects\n\nFor example, taking fish oil or specific herbs and vitamins can support healthy cholesterol, naturally and not cause any of these negative effects and in fact, can actually IMPROVE your libido and erections.\n\nToday I\u2019ve listed the top 5 most popular prescribed drugs that can cause lowered libido and erectile problems.\n\nOf course, there are many other prescription drugs, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) and street drugs, which I\u2019ll discuss in a future video.\n\nIf you\u2019re taking any one or a combination of the drugs I mentioned today, speak to your doctor and consider looking into natural alternatives that I\u2019ve listed below this video.\n\nBecause you and I both know that the older we get, the worse our hormones and the bigger this problem will become.\n\nTake action now to improve your drive, which will also improve your mood and confidence.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/clitoral-erections-fact-or-myth/",
    "content": "Today, I\u2019ve got a really interesting question \u2014 one that I\u2019ve never been asked before:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam, since I\u2019ve been taking the AlphaViril testosterone booster, I\u2019m having a lot more erections, especially while sleeping and in the morning. In fact, when I get up to pee in the middle of the night, I now have erections half the time, like when I was younger.\n\nHowever, my question is for my girlfriend \u2014 can she take AlphaViril to boost her testosterone and sex drive? And this is going to sound stupid, but can the clitoris get erect or grow like the penis, and have morning erections\u2026 or is that just a guy thing?\u201d\n\nThe answer is yes \u2014 the clitoris can and does get erect, just like a penis. I\u2019ll explain that more in a minute.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about your nighttime and morning erections, known as Nocturnal Erections.\n\nNocturnal Erections: What You Should Know\n\nMost men experience 3\u20135 erections per night during healthy sleep.\n\nThey occur primarily during REM sleep cycles.\n\nEach erection typically lasts 25\u201335 minutes.\n\nTotal erection time can range from 1.5 to 3 hours per night.\n\nThe final morning erection may last longer \u2014 hence the term \u201cmorning wood.\u201d\n\nHealthy men experience nocturnal erections from infancy through old age.\n\nRigidity and frequency peak in late teens and early 20s.\n\nDecline with age is due to hormonal changes and poor blood flow.\n\nComplete absence of nocturnal erections is not normal at any age and can indicate a health issue.\n\nNighttime erections are typically 80\u2013100% rigid.\n\nThey don\u2019t always relate to sexual dreams.\n\nBlood flow increases by 3\u20138x normal levels during these erections.\n\nBottom line: Assuming you\u2019re healthy and your hormones are balanced, you\u2019re getting multiple erections while you sleep \u2014 even if you don\u2019t always notice them.\n\nFrom Penis to Clitoris \u2014 What About Women?\n\nThe same biological principles apply to women. The clitoris is very similar to a penis \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t contain a urethra.\n\nIn fact, if you\u2019ve ever seen an enlarged clitoris in women with high testosterone (like female bodybuilders who take steroids), it can resemble a small penis.\n\nHow Erections Work in Both Men & Women\n\nBoth contain spongy tissue that fills with blood.\n\nWhen muscles relax, blood flows in and fills the area.\n\nThe tissue becomes longer, thicker, and more sensitive.\n\nJust like a penis, the clitoris becomes engorged and more sensitive during arousal. It\u2019s clitoral erection.\n\nThe tip of the clitoris is extremely sensitive \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s said to contain over 10,000 nerve fibers, making it even more sensitive than the tip of the penis.\n\nHormonal Pulses & Morning Erections\n\nYour body\u2019s hormones \u2014 including testosterone, estrogen, insulin, growth hormone, cortisol, and others \u2014 are released in pulses, not continuously throughout the day.\n\nThis is why natural testosterone production often produces better results than hormone replacement therapy.\n\nTestosterone is the primary hormone responsible for erections, both in men and women.\n\nTestosterone peaks in the morning, which is why we get \u201cMorning Wood\u201d in men and what I call \u201cMorning Bean\u201d in women.\n\nSexual Arousal: Men vs. Women\n\nJust as a man\u2019s penis gets erect during arousal and sex, so does the clitoris.\n\nBoth organs become bigger, fuller, and more sensitive during sexual stimulation.\n\nAs stated earlier, women do experience nocturnal and morning clitoral erections.\n\nCan Women Take AlphaViril?\n\nYes \u2014 AlphaViril can help boost sex drive in women as well, by naturally optimizing testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, women only need a lower dose than men. The formula works the same way, just with less required.\n\nMen and women both experience nighttime and morning erections.\n\nThe clitoris works like a penis, just smaller \u2014 but with even more sensitivity.\n\nTestosterone drives erections in both sexes, and AlphaViril can help when taken properly.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Women are biologically wired to respond to certain types of voices.\n\nYour Voice Is Like an Audio Fingerprint\n\nWhat most guys don\u2019t realize is that your voice says a lot about you, without you saying much at all.\n\nStudies from universities like UCL and McMaster show that women consistently rate lower-pitched voices as more attractive.\n\nBecause a deeper voice is subconsciously linked to:\n\nHigher testosterone levels\n\nIt\u2019s primal. Her brain hears your voice, and in milliseconds, it makes a decision: Safe or sexy? Strong or skip?\n\nOne study even found that women prefer deeper voices during ovulation, when they\u2019re most fertile, further proving that her biology is tuned to detect these cues of masculinity.\n\nAnother study showed that men with deeper voices had more sexual partners. Coincidence? Maybe\u2026 but probably not.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just about dating. CEOs with deeper voices are seen as more competent and make more money.\n\nYour voice influences how people respond to you in business and life.\n\nWhat Makes a Voice Attractive?\n\nIt\u2019s not just pitch \u2014 there are five key elements that make a voice attractive:\n\nLower frequencies tend to be more attractive, but not too low. Think Batman smooth, not robotic.\n\nA rich, chesty tone with vibration. Avoid sounding nasal or too \u201cheady.\u201d Speak from the chest.\n\nSpeaking slowly signals confidence. Rushing your words makes you seem nervous.\n\nClear, crisp pronunciation shows confidence and intelligence. Don\u2019t mumble.\n\nControlling silence creates tension and shows control. Learn to pause \u2014 it\u2019s powerful.\n\nYou Can Train Your Voice\n\nThe good news is \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be born with a deep voice.\n\nYou can actually train your voice to sound more masculine and attractive.\n\nI\u2019ve created a video series on exactly how to do this.\n\nBut here\u2019s the deal: Most guys get this wrong. When they get nervous, their voice goes higher, they start talking faster, and they talk too much. That kills attraction.\n\nSpeak from your chest\n\nThis is what communicates confidence, calm, and control.\n\nYour Voice Impacts Every Area of Your Life\n\nHow you sound affects how you\u2019re treated by women, men, and even in business settings.\n\nI\u2019ve had guys message me after watching my voice training videos and say:\n\n\u201cDude, women are reacting totally differently to me now.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the voice \u2014 it\u2019s the way they speak and communicate. You don\u2019t have to be born with it. It\u2019s a skill you can develop.\n\nTestosterone thickens the vocal cords and helps deepen your voice naturally, which is why I talk about it so often.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Train Your Voice Like a Muscle\n\nYour voice can literally change your:\n\nBecause yes, you may be texting now, but sooner or later, you\u2019ll need to talk to someone in real life. And how you speak will either attract or repel them.\n\nBe cool, practice your delivery, and remember \u2014 you can always improve your voice.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/7-ways-to-increase-testosterone-forever-at-any-age/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve made lots of videos and articles about increasing testosterone levels.\n\nBut today, it\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m simplifying and summarizing the best lifetime testosterone-boosting and hormone-optimizing methods you can use forever, regardless of your age or current testosterone levels.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about trendy tactics.\n\nIt\u2019s about natural, clinically and empirically backed methods that actually work in the real world.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the harder lifestyle changes and end with the easiest and fastest ways to boost testosterone.\n\n1. Optimize Your Diet\n\nConstantly dieting or eating at a caloric deficit increases stress hormones, which can lower testosterone levels.\n\nBut eating too many calories and becoming overweight raises estrogen, which also lowers testosterone.\n\nYou must balance cortisol and estrogen to optimize testosterone levels.\n\nYou need to consume fats, especially from sources with cholesterol, which is crucial for hormone production.\n\nI eat 2\u20133 whole eggs a few times a week (about a dozen per week).\n\nThe yolk is beneficial for testosterone.\n\nAvoid omega-6 fats from seeds and vegetable oils.\n\nInstead, supplement with omega-3 fish oil (2\u20135g/day) and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.\n\nCarbs increase insulin, which helps boost total and free testosterone.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a high-carb diet, but some healthy, low-sugar, unprocessed carbs are beneficial.\n\nKeto and carnivore diets typically lower testosterone.\n\nAnimal protein boosts testosterone.\n\nFocus on whole eggs, grass-fed meats, pasture-raised chicken, and wild-caught fish.\n\nI also add in whey isolate protein when I\u2019m busy.\n\nAvoid processed meats and cheap protein sources.\n\nEat about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.\n\nEat 4\u20135 smaller meals daily. Intermittent fasting is not ideal for testosterone.\n\nIf You Need to Lose Fat\n\nTry to burn more calories through exercise rather than drastically cutting food intake.\n\n2. Improve Your Sleep\n\nSleep is critical for hormone production, especially testosterone and growth hormone.\n\nCutting sleep to 5 hours a night can plummet testosterone levels in just days.\n\nMost people need 7\u20138 hours of quality sleep.\n\nThe best test? Wake up without an alarm and feel energized throughout the day. If you need coffee or pre-workouts to function, you\u2019re sleep-deprived.\n\nGo to bed around 10 PM and wake up naturally.\n\nAnd if you suffer from sleep apnea, it\u2019s absolutely killing your testosterone.\n\n3. Exercise the Right Way\n\nResistance training is #1 for testosterone.\n\nUse weights, machines, or cables\u2014whatever you prefer.\n\nTrain 3\u20135 times per week for about 1 hour.\n\nMore than that increases cortisol and lowers testosterone.\n\nLimit strenuous cardio. Too much can raise cortisol.\n\nInstead, do brisk walks for 10\u201320 minutes in the morning and around meals.\n\nDo this 2\u20134 times daily, totaling 20 to 75 minutes of light movement per day.\n\nStress increases cortisol, which suppresses testosterone. Learn to manage both physical and emotional stress.\n\nGet rid of toxic people\n\nLimit exposure to negative media\n\nStop obsessing over the past or worrying about unlikely future events\n\nExercise in moderation\n\nStimulate your brain with new learning\n\nIt\u2019s easier said than done, but you must act, not react, to people and your environment. I can also recommend my favorite supplements and herbs for stress management in the description below.\n\nRemember, the real opposite of testosterone isn\u2019t estrogen\u2014it\u2019s cortisol.\n\nAnd most people today are swimming in cortisol all day long.\n\n5. Use the Right Supplements\n\nMost of us are deficient in key nutrients.\n\nAnd while 95% of testosterone-boosting supplements are ineffective, a few do work\u2014if taken in the right dosage and form.\n\nI\u2019ve personally used natural testosterone booster for over 20 years \u2013 it\u2019s safe, effective, and clinically proven to work.\n\n6. Get Sexually Aroused More Often\n\nSexual arousal quickly boosts testosterone and dopamine. It can nearly double levels in minutes.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get aroused, it\u2019s likely because your testosterone is already low\u2014this creates a negative spiral.\n\nFollow everything in this video to break that cycle. Use your imagination, and remember: use it or lose it.\n\n7. The Easiest Method? Subscribe\n\nOkay, I\u2019m joking a bit \u2014 but seriously, I do have a lot of great articles that dive deeper into testosterone optimization. It\u2019s free for my readers and subscribers.\n\nDon\u2019t just listen\u2014take action.\n\nStart with one or two of these methods today. You don\u2019t have to do everything all at once, but you must start.\n\nTestosterone won\u2019t rise on its own. Aging and life stress will only make things worse.\n\nTake control now\u2014your body, your partner, and your future will thank you. I promise you\u2019ll look, feel, and perform better.\n\nYou\u2019ll only wish you started sooner.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/3-best-ways-of-increasing-your-free-testosterone-naturally/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 now and today\u2019s topic is: How do you increase your free testosterone levels?\n\nMost blood tests measure total testosterone, but the more important marker is your free testosterone.\n\nThink of it like this: Total testosterone is your gross income, while free testosterone is your net profit\u2014what\u2019s left after taxes and expenses. Free testosterone is what delivers the majority of testosterone\u2019s health and performance benefits.\n\nWhat Impacts Free Testosterone?\n\nSex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)\n\nOne of the biggest factors impacting your free testosterone is a protein called Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG).\n\nAs SHBG levels rise, free testosterone levels drop. Unfortunately, SHBG increases as you age, gain fat, or deal with stress.\n\nFactors That Raise SHBG\n\nDecreased growth hormone\n\nPoor liver function (due to aging, alcohol, medications)\n\nElevated cortisol and stress hormones\n\nVery low-carb diets like keto or carnivore can lower free testosterone by increasing SHBG.\n\nWhile total testosterone might appear higher on paper, free testosterone usually drops. That\u2019s not what you want.\n\nStep 1: Lower Estrogen to Reduce SHBG\n\nElevated estrogen increases SHBG and reduces free testosterone. As men age or gain body fat, estrogen often rises, throwing off the testosterone-to-estrogen ratio.\n\nHow to Lower Estrogen Naturally\n\nLose excess body fat: Fat cells produce more aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen.\n\nUse natural aromatase inhibitors: These block the aromatase enzyme and reduce estrogen conversion without crashing your levels.\n\nTop Natural Aromatase Inhibitors\n\nWhite button mushroom extract \u2013 400mg/day (must be extract, not raw powder)\n\nThese aren\u2019t as strong as prescription drugs like Arimidex or Letrozole, but that\u2019s a good thing\u2014you want to lower estrogen just slightly, not eliminate it.\n\nStep 2: Use Herbs That Boost Free Testosterone\n\nSome herbs can increase total testosterone while simultaneously reducing estrogen and SHBG, leading to higher free testosterone.\n\nTop Testosterone-Boosting Herbs\n\nHorny Goat Weed Extract\n\nImportant: Always use standardized extracts\u2014not raw powder. The raw root is typically ineffective.\n\nA Convenient Solution\n\nInstead of buying these herbs separately, I\u2019ve used a supplement called AlphaViril since 1999.\n\nIt contains all of the ingredients mentioned above, including natural aromatase inhibitors and testosterone boosters.\n\nStep 3: Improve Liver and Thyroid Health\n\nBoth liver and thyroid health influence your SHBG and hormone balance. Here\u2019s what to do:\n\nLimit liver-straining medications\n\nSupport thyroid function through a balanced diet and sufficient iodine and selenium intake\n\nStep 4: Manage Stress & Cortisol\n\nChronic stress increases cortisol, which drives up SHBG and reduces free testosterone. You can reduce cortisol by:\n\nGetting quality sleep\n\nReducing toxic relationships\n\nCutting back on stimulants\n\nTaking adaptogenic herbs like ashwagandha\n\nI can recommend Stress Cortisol Relief \u2013 which is what I use \u2013 it\u2019s safe, effective, and proven to work.\n\nIf you want to increase your free testosterone levels, focus on these 3 key areas:\n\nLower SHBG by reducing estrogen and improving thyroid/liver function\n\nTake herbal extracts that boost testosterone and reduce aromatase\n\nManage stress and optimize sleep\n\nAll of this can be done naturally and effectively, especially with supplementation like AlphaViril, which combines all of the proven ingredients into one convenient formula.\n\nWhile it\u2019s fresh on your mind, take action\u2014don\u2019t wait.\n\nThe longer you wait, the more your testosterone may decline with age.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "I know so many men who have prostate problems.\n\nHis brother died from prostate cancer.\n\nMy uncle on my mom\u2019s side had prostate cancer, but it\u2019s in remission.\n\nFriend\u2019s dad died of prostate cancer a year ago.\n\nMy 55-year-old best friend is having prostate surgery because he can hardly pee anymore, and that\u2019s with prostate-shrinking drugs. And he\u2019s a healthy guy.\n\nSimply stated, most men will have prostate problems the longer they live.\n\nYou may not die from it, even though prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in men.\n\nHowever, having prostate problems is going to suck because it\u2019s going to be uncomfortable and painful and also cause sexual problems.\n\nRemember, the prostate interacts when you urinate and ejaculate.\n\nSo, you really need to make sure it stays healthy and youthful as long as possible.\n\nSo, today you\u2019ll quickly discover:\n\nSymptoms of prostate problems\n\nCauses of prostate growth and cancer\n\nSolutions \u2013 both natural and medical\n\nLet\u2019s first talk about prostate growth, which is called BPH \u2013 benign prostatic hyperplasia:\n\nBenign because it\u2019s not cancerous\n\nProstatic means prostate\n\nHyperplasia means growth or enlargement\n\nBy age 50, about 50% of men have some prostate growth, even if there are no symptoms.\n\nUntil age 60, about 70% of men have BPH\n\nBy age 80, this increases to 80% of men\n\nBPH is NOT cancer and doesn\u2019t necessarily increase cancer risk\n\nThe size of the enlargement doesn\u2019t always correlate with symptom severity\n\nNow, how do you know if you have prostate cancer and not BPH or prostate growth?\n\nGetting a blood test checking for your PSA levels is important and something to keep an eye on.\n\nIf it\u2019s high or all of a sudden your PSA levels shoot up, then I\u2019m sure your doctor will dig deeper into things and see what the cause could be. Even a simple infection can temporarily raise PSA levels.\n\nSo, always have your doctor do a PSA blood test, especially if you\u2019re over the age of 40.\n\nMedical journals will list the following symptoms linked to prostate growth:\n\nUrinary frequency (going more than 8 times daily)\n\nSudden, strong urges to urinate\n\nNocturia (waking up more than once nightly to urinate)\n\nWeak urine stream compared to your younger years\n\nDifficulty starting urination (hesitancy)\n\nStarting and stopping mid-stream (intermittency)\n\nFeeling like you can\u2019t fully empty your bladder\n\nPost-void dribbling (leaking after you think you\u2019re done)\n\nUrgency leakage when you can\u2019t make it to the bathroom\n\nProstate growth happens for a variety of reasons.\n\n1 \u2013 Genetics and Family History\n\nAlways play a role, and it can increase your risk. However, my dad\u2019s younger brother died of prostate cancer and yet my dad never had it and he lived longer.\n\n2 \u2013 Hormonal Imbalances\n\nDHT is linked to prostate problems. It gets converted from testosterone. Your prostate gland has the highest amount of DHT receptors.\n\nYour skin and scalp also have lots of DHT receptors. Hence, high DHT causes body hair growth and hair loss.\n\nEstrogen is another major contributor to prostate growth AND cancer. It\u2019s probably worse than DHT. Something most experts won\u2019t tell you or know.\n\nIronically, testosterone is good for the prostate.\n\nHowever, as we age, testosterone levels drop and get converted more into DHT and Estrogen. This means lower testosterone and high \u201cnegative\u201d hormones.\n\nLow testosterone, combined with higher DHT and Estrogen, is a primary cause of prostate growth.\n\nLow levels of Vitamin D are linked to prostate growth. Vitamin D is not technically a vitamin \u2014 it\u2019s a hormone.\n\nMost people, especially men, do NOT have optimal levels.\n\n4 \u2013 Chronic Inflammation\n\nOngoing inflammation in the body contributes to prostate issues.\n\n5 \u2013 Metabolic Syndrome\n\nBeing unhealthy \u2014 high blood pressure, excess body fat, and diabetes \u2014 significantly raises the risk. Diabetes alone doubles your risk.\n\n6 \u2013 High Stress & Cortisol\n\nStress elevates cortisol, which puts pressure on the prostate gland and suppresses testosterone while raising inflammation and blood sugar.\n\nKeep body fat low. High body fat increases estrogen.\n\nHaving a waist circumference over 40 inches increases risk by 50%.\n\nJust 2 hours of walking weekly reduces BPH risk by 30%\n\nExercising 6x weekly reduces risk by 50%\n\n3 \u2013 Improve Your Diet\n\nLimit high-fat red meat\n\nEat 4+ servings of vegetables daily\n\nInclude lycopene-rich foods like tomatoes and watermelon\n\nUse extra virgin olive oil and fish oil\n\n4 \u2013 Manage Chronic Conditions\n\nControl diabetes, blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol\n\nLower inflammation and stress\n\n5 \u2013 Take Supplements or Medication\n\nDrugs like Finasteride (Propecia/Proscar) work well for shrinking the prostate but may cause erectile problems. They also increase estrogen.\n\nSaw Palmetto is a natural alternative. It works to lower DHT and estrogen with fewer side effects.\n\nZinc with copper also helps lower DHT, improve libido, and support prostate health with no sexual side effects.\n\nLose fat and take supplements like DIM, Zinc, and Vitamin D.\n\nUse anti-inflammatory herbs like curcumin, ginger, and boswellia extract.\n\nPrescription option: Flomax \u2014 an alpha-blocker that relaxes prostate and bladder muscles. It\u2019s effective and generally well-tolerated.\n\nIncrease Testosterone\n\nBoosting testosterone naturally while lowering DHT and estrogen can dramatically improve prostate health, libido, and erections.\n\nTestosterone injections (TRT) can worsen prostate issues due to high DHT and estrogen conversion, requiring additional meds to manage.\n\nAlphaViril was designed to improve testosterone while controlling DHT and estrogen \u2014 good for your hormones, erections, libido, and prostate.\n\nI\u2019ve worked with hundreds of men and ALL of them improved their prostate health using these steps.\n\nIf you do nothing, your prostate will grow larger and cause more pain, urinary issues, and sexual dysfunction \u2014 or worse, cancer.\n\nTake this seriously. Take action now. Don\u2019t just read \u2014 do something about it today.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/women-are-lowering-your-testosterone/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019ve got a controversial topic \u2014 do women lower your testosterone levels?\n\nThis came up after I received a long email from a subscriber, and I want to share that story and explore the science and personal experience behind it.\n\nA Real Story from a Viewer\n\nHere\u2019s the message I received:\n\n\u201cHey doc, I think being in a relationship is killing my testosterone. I\u2019m not motivated like I used to be and my sex drive is in the toilet.\n\nAbout two years ago, I did a blood test and my testosterone level was 812 \u2014 which I think is pretty good.\n\nThen I met my girlfriend. A year later, I did another blood test and it dropped to 371. Nothing else changed in my life other than having a girlfriend.\n\nRecently, I started taking AlphaViril and 6 months later, my testosterone increased to 724. I feel better, but still not as good as I was before my girlfriend. Could being in a relationship really lower my testosterone? Should I break up with her?\u201d\n\nInitial Reactions & What the Research Says\n\nYes \u2014 being in a relationship can lower testosterone levels.\n\nBut it\u2019s not that women themselves are the problem. This is a nuanced issue involving emotions, stress, lifestyle, and brain chemistry.\n\nDuring the early stages of dating, testosterone and dopamine levels are high \u2014 you\u2019re pursuing, hunting, energized.\n\nOver time, once your emotional needs are met, things become stable and sexually routine. Dopamine drops, and so does testosterone.\n\nToxic Relationships and Hormonal Health\n\nThis subscriber didn\u2019t mention the quality of his relationship. And that\u2019s important.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a toxic relationship \u2014 constantly criticized, manipulated, belittled \u2014 it\u2019s like emotional castration.\n\nThis causes a drop in self-esteem and can lead to increased cortisol, the real enemy of testosterone. That\u2019s right \u2014 the opposite hormone of testosterone isn\u2019t estrogen, it\u2019s cortisol. When cortisol rises, testosterone falls.\n\nHow Stress Kills Testosterone\n\nAny long-term stress increases cortisol and adrenaline, which decreases testosterone. Whether it\u2019s from:\n\nMoney or career problems\n\nRelationship conflict\n\n\u2026 Chronic stress is a major testosterone killer.\n\nScientific Studies on Relationships & Testosterone\n\nStudies show that men in committed romantic relationships have approximately 20\u201321% lower testosterone levels than single men.\n\nAnother study found that the longer a man is in a relationship, the lower his testosterone.\n\nSome researchers argue this is a good thing \u2014 it may reflect relationship satisfaction.\n\nBut for many men, low testosterone means a drop in sex drive, energy, and self-confidence.\n\nWhat Happens When Testosterone Drops?\n\nAs testosterone falls, so does drive, not just sexually, but in all areas of life.\n\nYou become apathetic. Stop taking action. You stop feeling like a man.\n\nLower testosterone can turn into a cycle of inaction and low self-worth. And if you\u2019re the type of person who\u2019s a \u201cnice guy,\u201d being in a toxic relationship can amplify these effects \u2014 especially if you\u2019re being taken for granted or disrespected.\n\nA Personal Story & Observation\n\nI dated a woman years ago who respected her mom but not her dad.\n\nHer mom was \u201cthe boss,\u201d and her dad was \u201ca potato.\u201d Over time, her mom had broken him down emotionally. He eventually gave up and stopped trying. I\u2019ve seen this in many relationships, and I\u2019ve experienced it myself.\n\nIf you\u2019re constantly accommodating and passive, you\u2019ll lose your partner\u2019s respect. And when respect is lost, attraction follows.\n\nThe Long-Term Cost of Staying in a Toxic Relationship\n\nIf you\u2019re in a toxic relationship, you have two choices:\n\nFix it with counseling if it\u2019s possible.\n\nGet out before it damages your health even further.\n\nPeople rarely change. If things are bad now, they often get worse.\n\nDon\u2019t let yourself be the person who sacrifices their health and happiness trying to \u201cmake it work\u201d when it\u2019s clearly harmful.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a positive, respectful relationship, awesome \u2014 communicate that appreciation.

    "content": "If you\u2019re dealing with erectile dysfunction, you\u2019re not broken \u2014 and you\u2019re definitely not alone.\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to show you how to fix it with the 8 best, clinically proven methods\u2026 no matter how bad your situation is.\n\nI\u2019ve personally dealt with erectile problems at various times in my life, so I know how it can kill your confidence and cause problems in your relationship.\n\nAlso, Erectile dysfunction isn\u2019t just a bedroom problem. It\u2019s a warning sign your body is trying to send you, which is also negatively affecting your heart and brain.\n\nWhy Does Erectile Dysfunction Happen?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to understand: Erectile dysfunction isn\u2019t just about blood flow \u2014 although that\u2019s a big part of it.\n\nLow testosterone & hormonal imbalances\n\nStress \u2013 emotional and/or physical\n\nLack of specific enzymes\n\nSide effects from common medications & drugs\n\nOr even a combination of the above. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 solution.\n\n8 Best Clinically Proven Solutions For Erectile Dysfunction\n\nMost people have heard of these drugs, such as Viagra and Cialis. PDE5 inhibitors block the PDE5 enzyme, relaxing blood vessels and increasing blood flow.\n\nOriginally developed for blood pressure, Sildenafil (Viagra\u2019s active ingredient) had an unexpected benefit \u2014 erections.\n\nThey work in about 50% of users, usually younger men with better testosterone levels. However, they don\u2019t fix the root cause and become less effective over time.\n\n2 \u2013 Testosterone Therapy\n\nTRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy) can help men with clinically low testosterone. It\u2019s available via injections, gels, or pills.\n\nIf done right, TRT can be amazing. If done wrong, it can cause side effects like acne, hair loss, prostate problems, testicle shrinkage, and mood swings.\n\nTRT is a lifelong commitment and should only be used after trying natural methods first.\n\n3 \u2013 Life Improvements\n\nEven with good hormone levels, stress, poor sleep, and emotional issues can destroy your sex drive and erections.\n\nFix your health, improve your diet, reduce stress, and get quality sleep.\n\nThese basics are often overlooked but are crucial for sexual performance.\n\nMost supplements don\u2019t work \u2014 unless you use the right ingredients, dosage, and extract.\n\nAlphaViril \u2013 A proven testosterone booster that also helps balance dopamine, estrogen, DHT, and cortisol.\n\nL-citrulline \u2013 Improves nitric oxide. Take 3\u20135g before sex (powder is more cost-effective).\n\n5 \u2013 Shockwave Therapy\n\nLow-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy uses sound waves to stimulate blood vessel growth in the penis.\n\nIt\u2019s still new but shows promising results for vascular-related ED. Some discomfort is expected, but it\u2019s temporary.\n\n6 \u2013 Penile Injections\n\nTrimix injections (papaverine, phentolamine, and prostaglandin E1) are used in extreme cases.\n\nThey work instantly but involve injecting directly into the penis. Effective, but should be a last resort and does NOT treat the root cause.\n\n7 \u2013 Vacuum Erection Devices (Penis Pumps)\n\nA mechanical way to draw blood into the penis. Prescribed by doctors and available online. Safe and non-invasive.\n\nEspecially effective when combined with other therapies. I\u2019ll cover the best pumps in a future video.\n\n8 \u2013 Penile Implants (Surgery)\n\nFor severe, irreversible ED, implants may be the final option. A mechanical device is surgically inserted to trigger erections on demand.\n\nHigh risk and permanent \u2014 only consider after trying everything else.\n\nIf you have erectile dysfunction, the good news is there are effective treatments \u2014 but first, you must figure out why it\u2019s happening.\n\nIs it physical? Hormonal? Emotional? Most likely, it\u2019s a mix of all three.\n\nThe best approach is a combination \u2014 treat the root cause, improve your lifestyle, and support your body with the right supplements or therapies.\n\nMillions of men deal with ED.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. But you do need to take action today to get your confidence, vitality, and erections back.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/6-ways-to-make-viagra-work-better/",
    "content": "Even though you hear how awesome a drug like Viagra is for erections, you don\u2019t hear about all the problems, and one of them is that Viagra doesn\u2019t work for almost 50% of users.\n\nClinical studies show that up to 35% of users are non-responders. That means even at the highest dose of 100 mg, a \u201csatisfactory erection is not achieved\u201d.\n\nThis typically has to do with genetics or hormonal problems.\n\nOn top of the 35%, there\u2019s another 15%\u201320% of users who don\u2019t respond because of some pre-existing health problem, such as diabetes, poor blood flow, blood pressure issues, and so forth.\n\nThen there\u2019s another 10%\u201315% of users who get too many side effects such as low blood pressure, nasal or eye problems, headaches, rapid heart rate, and so forth.\n\nNow, I just threw a bunch of boring percentages at you.\n\nThe bottom line is that Viagra doesn\u2019t work for a lot more people than it does for.\n\nHowever, let me give you some simple solutions that can improve these numbers while also reducing the negative side effects.\n\nFirst and foremost, the higher your testosterone levels, the better Viagra will work for you.\n\nTestosterone improves Nitric Oxide (NO) levels, which is how Viagra works.\n\nTestosterone boosts Dopamine, which also supports stronger erections.\n\nThis is why Viagra works much better in younger men with high testosterone levels than in older guys with low testosterone. It\u2019s a sad irony \u2014 the guys who don\u2019t need it, it works better for them than the guys who do.\n\nThe good news is that you can naturally increase testosterone levels, which will make Viagra work better even at a lower dose.\n\nStart with a low dose to see how you respond:\n\nStart with 25 mg a couple of times\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, try 50 mg\n\nIf still no result, then go to 100 mg\n\n3. How You Take It Matters\n\nIf taking it orally, drink it with water on an empty stomach \u2014 at least 2 hours after a meal or 1 hour before eating.\n\nTaking it with food dramatically lowers its effectiveness.\n\nBetter method: Take it sublingually (under your tongue):\n\nLet it dissolve under your tongue for 5\u201310 minutes\n\nThen wash it down with a glass of water\n\nYou can also take it as a suppository (in your rectum) for fast absorption, but sublingual is easier and more effective for most people.\n\nViagra has a 4-hour half-life, which means half of the drug is still in your system after 4 hours.\n\nIt takes 20\u201360 minutes to hit peak effectiveness once consumed. This varies depending on:\n\nSublingual vs oral intake\n\nFor some people, it can take up to 2 hours to really kick in. Be patient.\n\n5. Avoid These Mistakes\n\nRemember: Viagra doesn\u2019t cause an erection on its own. You still need to get aroused.\n\nSo avoid anything that kills arousal or blood flow:\n\nPrescription meds known to cause ED\n\nIf you already have erection issues AND low testosterone, don\u2019t make it worse by taking substances that cause erectile problems.\n\n6. Supplements That Can Help\n\nThis amino acid boosts nitric oxide levels. Take 5 grams about 30 minutes before sex.\n\nTip: Use powder form \u2014 it\u2019s cheaper and faster absorbing than pills.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, testosterone is essential for Viagra to work. A quality testosterone booster is a must.\n\nImproving overall circulation and vascular health helps maximize performance. Certain supplements can enhance blood flow to the muscles \u2014 including your penis.\n\nIf you\u2019ve done everything mentioned above \u2014 optimized hormones, increased testosterone, and taken Viagra the right way \u2014 and it still doesn\u2019t work\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t worry \u2014 there are other options.\n\nI\u2019ll be doing an article soon covering these alternatives.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/8-proven-ways-to-stop-nighttime-peeing-nocturia-in-men/",
    "content": "Waking up multiple times at night to urinate (nocturia) can disrupt sleep, increase stress hormones, decrease testosterone, and significantly lower the quality of life.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s often caused by aging and some lesser-known hormonal changes \u2014 and NO, not the ones you\u2019ve likely heard about in the past.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick guide on why it happens and how to minimize it.\n\n1. Control Your Liquids\n\nStart the day with plenty of water and salt.\n\nThen, slowly reduce your liquid intake throughout the day and avoid any liquids 2\u20133 hours before bed.\n\nThe more water you drink, the more salt you need to help absorb it \u2014 especially as we get older and have lower hormone levels.\n\nCertain compounds act as diuretics \u2014 meaning they increase urination. This includes:\n\nPotassium supplements\n\nDandelion extract, parsley, Uva Ursi\n\nTry to limit or eliminate them close to bedtime.\n\n3. Prostate Enlargement & Nocturia\n\nAs men age, their prostate naturally grows due to hormonal imbalances and aging itself.\n\nGet a blood test to check your PSA levels and do a prostate exam to ensure everything is okay.\n\nProstate growth happens due to low testosterone and higher levels of estrogen and DHT.\n\nYou can try natural ways to optimize your hormones and increase testosterone levels using herbs and minerals.\n\nYou can also consider medications like Finasteride and Flomax, but they may have side effects like erectile dysfunction.\n\n4. Decline in Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH / Vasopressin)\n\nADH helps the body retain water at night. This hormone is high in children and young people but declines with age, causing increased nighttime urination.\n\nMost experts never mention this!\n\nLowering cortisol can help increase ADH and improve sleep quality.\n\nThere\u2019s also a prescription option called Desmopressin, a synthetic ADH, used for severe nocturia.\n\n5. Increase Sodium Intake\n\nI already mentioned how important salt is.\n\nWhen we\u2019re younger, higher sex and growth hormones help our bodies retain water naturally.\n\nAs we age, we need to add more salt to help absorb water or else we just pee it all out.\n\n6. Manage Blood Sugar\n\nHigh blood sugar and insulin levels increase urination. It\u2019s a common symptom of diabetes.\n\nCheck your blood sugar and A1C levels in a blood test. Also, reduce sugar in your diet to support stable blood sugar.\n\n7. Kidney Issues & Nocturia\n\nFluid retention during the day can shift to nighttime urination if your kidneys are processing it then.\n\nGet your creatinine and cystatin C levels checked in a blood test to assess kidney function.\n\nDehydration and thick blood stress your kidneys. That\u2019s why staying well-hydrated during the day is so important.\n\n8. Bladder Training & Pelvic Floor Exercises\n\nStrengthen your pelvic muscles with Kegel exercises to improve bladder control.\n\nOne of my favorite tips: delay urination slightly during the day to build bladder capacity.\n\nAs the day progresses, try to hold your urine a little longer (without hurting yourself). This starts to train your bladder to hold more, reducing the urgency and frequency at night.\n\nDon\u2019t drink liquids too close to bedtime\n\nAdd more salt to help absorb liquids\n\nAvoid alcohol, coffee, and tea near bedtime\n\nDo blood tests for kidneys, blood sugar, and prostate health\n\nOptimize your hormones: increase testosterone, reduce estrogen, DHT, and cortisol\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/how-big-is-her-vagina-surprising-scientific-facts/",
    "content": "\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 this is going to be a weird question, but how big or deep is the Vagina? I ask because I did a Google search and found it\u2019s not too deep, like 4 inches. Yet, how does an average penis go all the way in, let alone the big 10 inch porn penis? I know, this is a silly question, but I thought I\u2019d ask because I\u2019m totally confused. Thanks\u201d\n\nWhy Size Of Vagina Matters Too\n\nYou make some interesting points. More so, most people will talk about the size of the penis \u2013 how long or thick or big or small.\n\nYet, rarely does anyone talk about the size of the vagina, which is also important especially when it comes to understanding sexual compatibility.\n\nAverage Vagina Length & Width\n\nMultple studies have shown that the average length or depth of the vagina is about 3.5\u20134 inches or 9\u201310 cm.\n\nNow, some are shorter, about 2.5 inches or 6 cm. While some are longer, about 5 inches or 12 cm.\n\nAs far as the width of the vagina, the range is between 2.5\u20135 inches or 6\u201312 cm.\n\nI\u2019ll talk about the average penis size in a minute.\n\nVaginal Arousal Increases Size\n\nNow, these numbers change and grow when she\u2019s aroused and turned on.\n\nThe cervix pulls up and back, adding 1\u20132 inches to vaginal length.\n\nThere\u2019s also additional tissue relaxation, expansion, and lubrication for greater flexibility and easier penetration.\n\nSo, if the average vagina is up to 4 inches, plus another 2 inches when she\u2019s aroused, that comes to about 6 inches deep as a potential maximum \u2013 right?\n\nYou Don\u2019t Need a Huge Penis to Satisfy Her\n\nSo what does this mean?\u2026\n\nThat you don\u2019t need a huge penis to satisfy a woman. In fact, most of the sensitivity is in the first 2\u20133 inches of the vagina.\n\nThat\u2019s why your finger can be a powerful tool.\n\nI mention this because I know many guys are insecure about the size of your penis. So, I\u2019m just letting you know, that you don\u2019t need a huge, 8\u201310 inch porn penis to satisfy her\u2026\n\nAnd honestly, most women don\u2019t want a huge penis.\n\nAverage Man\u2019s Penis Size\n\nBut let\u2019s quickly talk about the average penis size.\n\nThe average erect penis length worldwide is approximately 5.4 inches.\n\n95% of men have erect penises ranging from 4.2 to 6.7 inches.\n\n99.7% of men have erect penises shorter than 7.3 inches.\n\nThis means that the vast majority of men fall within a relatively narrow range, and those with lengths over 7 inches are statistically uncommon and very rare.\n\nSo if you have a penis over 8 inches, you are about 0.3% of the population.\n\nThe next time you watch porn and see a huge dick, just know that it\u2019s the rare exception and not the norm.\n\nThat\u2019s why he is in porn.\n\nSo, please stop comparing yourself to these rare exceptions.\n\nJust as the avid basketball player doesn\u2019t compare himself to Michael Jordan. Or the guy lifting weights shouldn\u2019t compare himself to a professional bodybuilder.\n\nThese are rare, genetic freaks.\n\nAdditionally, the next time you hear a girl saying how she likes a big penis or her ex-boyfriend had this huge dick or something similar, just know that she\u2019s either lying or she can\u2019t measure.\n\nHowever, if you do want to increase the size of your penis for whatever reason \u2014 the length or girth or both \u2014 I have a free guide about this topic.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about growing your penis, it\u2019s also about improving the health of your penis, erection quality, and so forth.\n\nI\u2019ll give you the link to that at the end of this video.\n\nCommon Misconceptions\n\nLet me also quickly talk about some common misconceptions.\n\nHaving more sexual partners does NOT change the vaginal size or length. Again, it\u2019s mostly genetics.\n\nIf a woman\u2019s vagina feels looser over time, possibly because she\u2019s had babies, or age \u2014 that\u2019s caused by neurological conditions or having less collagen and usually, having a weak pelvic floor.\n\nAnd to help fix that and tighten the vagina, doing Kegel exercises will help. In fact, Kegel exercises are also very helpful for men for improving erections.\n\nHow Porn Creates Size Illusions\n\nAnd finally to address your other question about how a porn star with a huge 8\u201310 inch penis can penetrate a vagina that can only go 6\u20137 inches maximum depth\u2026\n\nWell, certain angles will give the illusion that the penis is all the way in. Such as doggie style because her ass is in the way.\n\nAlso, if you pay close attention, the guy is not putting his penis all the way in to the base. He\u2019s penetrating as far as he can, but it\u2019ll be around 6\u20137 inches, depending on the girl.\n\nIt\u2019s rarely \u201cballs deep\u201d. Granted, there are some women who can take it all. But that\u2019s just their genetics. Most women can\u2019t.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s porn and these people are acting. They may pretend to be enjoying it, but they are in a bit of pain and discomfort.\n\nI used to consult porn guys years ago and they would tell me that the girls would take painkillers if the guy was really big.\n\nSo in summary, the vagina is not as big as you think. The average penis is fine for the average vagina.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a man watching this, try not to feel so insecure about the size of your penis.\n\nHowever, I do know that some guys do want a larger, thicker, and harder penis and I created a free guide for that.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/top-7-testosterone-killers-in-your-home/",
    "content": "If you\u2019ve been reading my blog for any length of time, you know that genetics aside, I am a firm believer that the way you look and feel, is very dependent on your hormones.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many factors that can negatively affect your hormones \u2013 food, exercise, stress, supplements, and today\u2019s topic \u2013 7 things in your home, that are lowering and killing your testosterone levels and at the same time, increasing your negative, \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones.\n\nThis is a problem for both men and women, but much more so for men because they are very dependent on testosterone.\n\nBasically, with all of these testosterone killers in your home, the end result is that you look and feel older.\n\nYou\u2019re going to lose your sex drive, lose muscle size and strength, get fatter, feel depressed, and accelerate the aging process!\n\nAnd it seems that a primary cause of these problems is excess estrogen, which indirectly lowers testosterone. Also, estrogen is the primary cause of both breast AND prostate cancer.\n\nSo, it\u2019s a big problem that you want to fix.\n\nNow, your body can create its own estrogen internally (endogenously). However, there are also environmental estrogens, from the outside (exogenously), and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to quickly discuss today because these you CAN control.\n\nThus, you should try your best to limit or hopefully eliminate the following 7 testosterone killers in your home.\n\nOtherwise known as BPA, it is probably the most well-known of a family of chemicals used in the production of polycarbonate plastics for its effect on the hardness of plastic. Not only has it been linked to low testosterone levels, but also to erectile dysfunction and cancers, both prostate and breast. You can find it in:\n\nReusable plastic bottles\n\nClear, hard plastic items\n\nThe lining of food cans\n\nAnother large family of chemicals has a weak affinity for estrogen receptors.\n\nThey are most present in sun-blocking, SPF-blocking lotions though\u2026 and this is where they have the potential to cause more damage because you\u2019ll be applying these sun-blocking lotions all over your body. This is not only a very large surface area, but your skin also absorbs the chemicals quickly.\n\nSo if you\u2019re out in the sun, please have a gradual exposure or use a paraben-free lotion. You will find those in a wide variety of products in your medicine cabinet:\n\nMany air fresheners, scented candles, and also other items with the mysterious ingredient \u201cperfume\u201d are actually phthalates, a compound also used to make plastics more flexible.\n\nYou can find them in many cosmetics and personal care items as well. Make sure you stay away from:\n\nNon-organic/non-Essential Oil-based scented candles\n\nMost commercial perfumes\n\nScented bathroom sprays\n\nAromatic personal care products\n\nThey have also been found in a lot of fast-food items\n\nSo these 3 are external \u201cxenoestrogens\u201d. There are also food-based ones, which would be internal. The two worst are Soy and Beer.\n\nThis is the main food source for massive amounts of phytoestrogens. Many vegans and vegetarians want to compensate for the lack of protein from animal sources by eating more soy, which leads to a host of health issues \u2013 one of the worst, in my opinion, being a decrease in thyroid levels.\n\nBut suffice it to say that regular consumption of soy, even a large dose of the fermented sources, can have detrimental effects on your testosterone levels. Soy is most commonly found in:\n\nTextured soy protein (TSP) or textured vegetable protein (TVP)\n\nHops found in beer are actually a rich source of phytoestrogens, and even beer on the weekends does decrease testosterone levels. So regular drinking or large amounts have effects on your androgen levels that are compounded by the other health hazards that alcohol has.\n\nThis is the main antibacterial agent found in antibacterial soap. It and its cousin triclocarban have a testosterone-lowering effect by decreasing the biosynthesis of testosterone.2,3 In fact, it\u2019s also a carcinogen (cancer-causing). It\u2019s so bad that the European Union banned this chemical in 2010, and so has the state of Minnesota, but not the other 49 states.\n\nIt should also be noted that they do a poor job of killing bacteria and are partly to blame for the development of new strains of bacteria that are more resistant. You can find it in:\n\nantibacterial soaps and shampoos (Dial, Softsoap, Clearasil\u2026)\n\nskin cleansing wipes (SaniCart)\n\ntoothpaste (Colgate Total\u2026)\n\ndeodorants (Old Spice, Right Guard\u2026)\n\nshaving gels (Gillette\u2026)\n\nchildren\u2019s toys (Playskool\u2026)\n\nbrake fluids (STP, Valvoline, Pennzoil\u2026)\n\nantibacterial socks (Fruit of the Loom, Dickies\u2026)\n\nThese types of chemicals are found most often in sunscreen lotions \u2013 something I told people to avoid over 20 years ago, but that\u2019s another topic. Not only do these chemicals lower your testosterone, but they also decrease androgen receptor sensitivity.4 So, that\u2019s doubly bad.\n\nOh, it also happens to lower thyroid production as well5 \u2013 so now you\u2019ll be losing muscle AND getting fatter at the same time.\n\nSpeaking of getting fat, these chemicals ALSO increase estradiol (estrogen) levels in men.6\n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot of other chemicals found in your home that kill your testosterone levels, while also increasing negative estrogen levels. I just wanted to list some of the most common and potent.\n\nThere are also environmental ones, such as most herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides. But, I\u2019ll discuss that another day.\n\nMy suggestion here is to reread this blog and go through your home and eliminate these types of products and ingredients. As I said, there are more \u2013 but this is a good start.\n\nTry your best to eat natural, organically grown foods.\n\nThen, you\u2019ll need to reverse the damage by stimulating your body to produce more testosterone, while reducing and eliminating excess estrogen levels \u2013 in addition to other \u201ctestosterone-killing\u201d hormones.\n\nAnd for that, I suggest you click on this special link and discover a proven formula for naturally boosting your testosterone levels, and increasing your libido and muscle size.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16571087\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X08002850\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/107/1/56/1664314\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20005209\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X11002393\n\nhttp://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=319040401687055;res=IELHEA",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I recently got a question from a subscriber that\u2019s extremely common \u2014 and something I\u2019ve personally experienced myself, especially when I was younger.\n\n\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 I\u2019m having problems during sex. When it\u2019s time to get intimate, I lose my erection. Or, sometimes during sex, I go limp. I don\u2019t have problems when I masturbate. This is happening mainly around sex and I\u2019m feeling really embarrassed about it. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to break up with me. Any suggestions?\u201d\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing is called performance anxiety.\n\nAnd even though most guys will lie and pretend it never happens to them \u2014 trust me, it\u2019s very common. You\u2019re not alone, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\n\nWhy Does Performance Anxiety Happen?\n\nThis issue tends to show up in younger men or in new relationships, when confidence is low and insecurity is high \u2014 even if it\u2019s subconscious.\n\nIt could be triggered by:\n\nPast negative sexual experiences\n\nComments from your partner that caused self-doubt\n\nUnrealistic expectations from porn or comparisons with her past partners\n\nWorrying about your penis size or performance ability\n\nStress from unrelated issues like work, finances, or health\n\nThe fear of \u201cfailing\u201d again based on a previous limp moment\n\nWhat happens next is your body enters a stress response \u2014 your heart rate increases, your body releases cortisol and adrenal hormones, and blood flow to your penis decreases.\n\nYour Brain Is Your Greatest Sex Organ\n\nRemember: relaxation = erections.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system promotes erections, while the sympathetic nervous system (the stress response) shuts them down.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking negative thoughts, even subconsciously, your body responds by reducing sexual function.\n\nYou\u2019re literally stressing yourself out of an erection.\n\nHere are several strategies to reduce performance anxiety and improve your ability to perform \u2014 physically and mentally.\n\n1. Recognize It\u2019s Normal\n\nThis happens to a lot of men. It\u2019s not about masculinity or attraction \u2014 it\u2019s about your mindset and nervous system.\n\n2. Practice Mindfulness During Intimacy\n\nStay in the moment. Don\u2019t let your mind race with fear or past experiences.\n\nFocus on physical sensations, her reactions, and your own pleasure\n\nWhen your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the present (yes, it takes practice)\n\nThis is especially helpful if you have ADHD or overactive thoughts \u2014 like I do.\n\nBut the more you practice, the easier it gets.\n\n3. Communicate With Your Partner\n\nMost women will appreciate your vulnerability and will NOT take it personally \u2014 especially if you\u2019re open about what you\u2019re feeling.\n\nOpen communication reduces pressure and builds trust and connection.\n\n4. Remove the Pressure to Perform\n\nReframe sex as an opportunity for connection and mutual pleasure, not a performance test.\n\nFocus more on foreplay, kissing, touching, and massaging her\n\nBuild anticipation and intimacy without rushing into penetration\n\nWomen usually don\u2019t want to go \u201cright into sex\u201d anyway \u2014 slow it down\n\n5. Practice Relaxation Techniques\n\nBefore intimacy, activate your parasympathetic nervous system with relaxation techniques:\n\nTry deep breathing: Inhale for 3 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds (longer exhale = relaxation)\n\nUse progressive muscle relaxation or meditation to calm your mind and body\n\n6. Try the Sensate Focus Approach\n\nThis involves gradually increasing intimacy without focusing on sex. Start with non-genital touch and slowly move forward as comfort builds.\n\nNo pressure = less anxiety = better performance.\n\n7. Avoid Alcohol & Substances\n\nAlcohol and weed might seem to help nerves, but they impair erectile function and dull physical sensitivity.\n\n8. Be Patient With Yourself\n\nRecovery takes time. Each positive experience builds confidence for the next one.\n\nRemember: what you focus on expands.\n\nIf you focus on what could go wrong, your body will respond accordingly.\n\nIf you focus on pleasure, connection, and enjoying the moment, you\u2019ll stay relaxed \u2014 and your erection will follow.\n\nI\u2019ve posted links to my favorite ways to:\n\nIncrease libido and sex drive\n\nBoost testosterone and dopamine\n\nImprove blood flow for harder, longer-lasting erections\n\nThese strategies give you the physical edge so you can feel more confident and reduce performance anxiety naturally.\n\nTry a few of these, stay consistent, and let me know what works best for you.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/want-a-thicker-beard-2-proven-methods-clinically-proven/",
    "content": "Today, it\u2019s 2025, and I want to answer a question I\u2019ve gotten many times over the years:\n\n\u201cHow do I get a thicker beard?\u201d\n\nIs it hormonal? Is it topical? What actually works?\n\nEven though I don\u2019t have a thick beard myself \u2014 and if I did, it would probably be all white at this point \u2014 I know a lot of guys today want that rugged, full facial hair look.\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about two simple and proven ways to boost beard growth.\n\nWhat Really Controls Beard Growth?\n\nAside from genetics, your ability to grow facial hair comes down to two key hormones:\n\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT)\n\nDHT is produced when testosterone is converted by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase.\n\nThis is the hormone most associated with things like body hair growth, facial hair development, and, unfortunately, hair loss and prostate issues.\n\nBeard Growth vs. Hair Loss: What\u2019s the Deal?\n\nGuys with high DHT are often bald and hairy. That thick hair on your back or shoulders? That\u2019s DHT-driven.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting \u2014 some guys have high testosterone and DHT, but still don\u2019t have much body or facial hair.\n\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s not just about hormone levels \u2014 it\u2019s about how sensitive your androgen receptors are on the skin.\n\nI\u2019ve seen bodybuilders on steroids with full heads of hair and barely any body hair. That\u2019s due to low skin sensitivity to androgens.\n\nAnd for some ethnicities, like Asians, even higher hormone levels may not translate into visible hair growth because of this same receptor resistance.\n\nStep 1: Optimize Your Testosterone Levels Naturally\n\nThe first and most important step is to optimize your testosterone and DHT levels naturally.\n\nHigher testosterone leads to higher DHT, which will stimulate facial hair growth. If you\u2019re struggling to grow a beard, there\u2019s a good chance your testosterone is low or sub-optimal.\n\nI\u2019ve listed my recommended herbs, supplements, and lifestyle strategies to increase testosterone naturally in the description below this video.\n\nStep 2: Use Topical Minoxidil (Rogaine) on Your Beard\n\nMinoxidil, also known as Rogaine, is typically used as a topical treatment for head hair. But it also works for facial hair.\n\nIn fact, it was originally an oral blood pressure drug, and doctors noticed one \u201cside effect\u201d \u2014 guys started growing back their hair.\n\nLater, they developed a topical version to target scalp hair \u2014 but here\u2019s the thing: you can apply the same topical version to your face to help grow your beard.\n\nHow to Use Minoxidil on Your Beard\n\nUse the 5% topical solution \u2014 available in liquid or foam form\n\nApply it twice daily \u2014 morning and night\n\nDon\u2019t wash it off right away \u2014 leave it on your face for full absorption\n\nBe consistent \u2014 noticeable results may take 1 to 3 months, and significant results around 6 months\n\nLiquid tends to work better for the face because it rubs in more effectively. Foam is lighter and better suited for scalp application.\n\nAdvanced Tips for Faster Beard Growth\n\nFor faster results, some people use higher concentrations of minoxidil \u2014 like 10% or even 12%.\n\nThe higher the concentration, the more likely it is to leave a sticky film or residue on your face\n\nIf you\u2019re applying it during the day and need to go out, stick to 5%\n\nYou can apply the stronger version at night and wash it off in the morning\n\nDouble Your Results by Combining Both Methods\n\nIf you want to maximize your beard growth, the ideal method is:\n\nBoost testosterone levels naturally using proven lifestyle and supplement strategies\n\nApply topical minoxidil twice daily to stimulate localized hair growth\n\nThis two-pronged approach works like building muscle: testosterone builds the foundation, while the exercises (in this case, minoxidil) stimulate the localized growth response.\n\nSummary: The Truth About Growing a Thicker Beard\n\nIf you want a thicker beard, it comes down to hormonal optimization and stimulating hair follicles in the right way.\n\nTopical minoxidil works. So does raising your testosterone levels. But you\u2019ll need patience, consistency, and the right combination of methods.\n\nAll the resources, supplement recommendations, and product links I mention are available below in the description area. Let me know your results if you try it out, and remember \u2014 happy beard growing.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025 and I want to talk about one of the most overlooked hormones when it comes to testosterone, sex drive, energy, mood, and even fat loss \u2014 and that hormone is cortisol.\n\nMost people focus only on boosting testosterone, which is great.\n\nBut what they don\u2019t realize is that cortisol is the OPPOSITE of testosterone. When cortisol goes up, testosterone goes down. Period.\n\nProblems Caused By High Cortisol\n\nWhen cortisol is chronically elevated, it can lead to a wide range of health issues \u2014 especially for men trying to improve performance, build muscle, or increase libido.\n\nLower sex drive and erection problems\n\nHigher blood sugar and increased risk of diabetes\n\nElevated blood pressure\n\nPoor quality sleep and insomnia\n\nSluggish thyroid function\n\nMuscle loss and belly fat accumulation\n\nAnxiety and nervousness\n\nIncreased inflammation and chronic pain\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re dealing with low testosterone symptoms, there\u2019s a good chance that your cortisol levels are too high.\n\nTop 5 Ways to Lower Cortisol Naturally\n\nHere are 5 of the most effective, proven ways to reduce cortisol and help optimize testosterone, libido, and overall health.\n\n1. Improve Your Sleep Quality\n\nSleep is the #1 factor for hormone balance.\n\nIf you\u2019re not getting enough deep, restorative sleep, your cortisol will stay elevated \u2014 and your testosterone will suffer.\n\nMake sleep a top priority \u2014 don\u2019t sacrifice it\n\nDon\u2019t wake up to an alarm \u2014 wake up naturally whenever possible\n\nGo to bed at the same time every night\n\nSleep in a dark, cool, and quiet room\n\nUnplug and relax for at least one hour before bed\n\nAvoid caffeine and late workouts\n\nTake calming supplements before bed \u2013 I recommend Deep Sleep Formula\n\n2. Exercise \u2014 But Don\u2019t Overdo It\n\nRegular exercise helps lower cortisol\u2026 but too much can backfire and increase stress hormones.\n\nExercise consistently but not excessively\n\nTry to train earlier in the day\n\nKeep sessions moderate in length and intensity\n\nPost-workout, take nutrients that reduce cortisol like glycine, vitamin C, and Stress Cortisol Relief\n\n3. Eat To Stabilize Blood Sugar\n\nBlood sugar spikes and crashes increase cortisol, which leads to more stress and less testosterone.\n\nEat meals that help maintain stable blood sugar\n\nReduce processed foods and refined sugars\n\nInclude omega-3 fats in your diet for hormone balance\n\nTake supplements that help stabilize blood sugar \u2013 my favorite is Blood Sugar Optimizer\n\n4. Eliminate Sources of Stress & Anxiety\n\nChronic mental stress is one of the biggest cortisol triggers. Start identifying and eliminating what\u2019s draining your mental bandwidth.\n\nLimit news and social media, especially before bed and first thing in the morning\n\nCut out negative people and toxic environments\n\nTurn off unnecessary phone notifications\n\nStop worrying about things you can\u2019t control\n\nUse stress-reducing herbs and adaptogens like ProVanax\n\n5. Take Mini Daily Breaks\n\nInstead of waiting for stress to build up, actively lower cortisol throughout the day with short, intentional breaks.\n\nTake a 5-minute break every 60\u201390 minutes\n\nPractice deep breathing or short meditation\n\nGo for a quick walk to reset your nervous system\n\nJournal about what you\u2019re grateful for\n\nDrink water regularly \u2014 dehydration increases cortisol\n\nFinal Thoughts: Balance Cortisol to Boost Testosterone\n\nIf you want higher testosterone and better sex drive, you need to do more than just boost hormones \u2014 you also need to reduce cortisol.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about adding things in \u2014 sometimes, it\u2019s about removing what\u2019s hurting your body the most.\n\nLowering cortisol is one of the fastest ways to improve mood, energy, focus, libido, erections, and overall hormone health.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with stress!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve \"healthy stress hormone levels\" with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "I get asked all sorts of questions from men when it comes to testosterone, sex drive, erectile problems, and sexual performance with women.\n\nAnd when I dig deeper into the root causes of these issues, one thing consistently shows up in the conversation: porn.\n\nSo today, let\u2019s answer the big question \u2014 Could watching too much porn be silently lowering your testosterone and sex drive?\n\nLet\u2019s look at what science says and what you can do to reverse the damage and get your performance back.\n\n1. The Dopamine Problem \u2013 Why Porn is Addictive\n\nWatching porn triggers massive dopamine spikes in the brain \u2014 similar to what happens with drugs like cocaine.\n\nOver time, the brain adapts to this overstimulation, making normal, real-life sex feel less exciting or rewarding.\n\nStudies show excessive porn use leads to dopamine desensitization\n\nThis causes users to seek more extreme content for the same \u201chigh\u201d\n\n2. Porn-Induced Erectile Dysfunction (PIED)\n\nThis is happening more and more \u2014 especially in younger men.\n\nThey\u2019re not struggling with ED because of age\u2026 it\u2019s from too much porn use.\n\nReal-life intimacy doesn\u2019t match the intensity of porn, so the brain has a weaker response\n\nA 2016 study found that more porn = lower sexual satisfaction and weaker erections\n\n3. The Coolidge Effect \u2013 Why Porn Makes Real Sex Feel Boring\n\nThe Coolidge Effect is an evolutionary survival trait: males are wired to seek novelty and new mates.\n\nThat\u2019s why men produce millions of sperm daily \u2014 to maximize reproduction opportunities.\n\nPorn tricks the brain into thinking you\u2019re constantly with new partners.\n\nThis kills long-term attraction to real partners\n\nIt makes actual relationships feel dull, leading to boredom, disconnection, and frustration\n\n4. Does Porn Lower Testosterone?\n\nShort-term: Watching porn can give a brief testosterone boost due to anticipation.\n\nLong-term: Chronic porn use leads to:\n\nLower baseline testosterone levels\n\nDopamine burnout and emotional flatness\n\nIncreased cortisol (stress hormone)\n\nHigher prolactin, which suppresses both dopamine and testosterone\n\nA 2012 study showed that frequent porn users had lower sexual confidence and motivation.\n\n5. Psychological Side Effects of Chronic Porn Use\n\nIn addition to hormone damage, porn can also harm your mental and emotional health:\n\nIncreased social anxiety, especially around women\n\nLower self-esteem due to unrealistic body and performance standards\n\nLess motivation to seek out real relationships or intimacy\n\nSome researchers call it sexual exhaustion \u2014 your brain is no longer excited by real sex\n\nHow to Reverse the Damage\n\nNow let\u2019s get into the solutions.\n\nIf you want to restore testosterone, dopamine, confidence, and libido, you need to start with reducing or quitting porn.\n\nStudies show that quitting porn for just 90 days can dramatically improve:\n\nConfidence and sexual motivation\n\nDesire for real sex and intimacy\n\nOther Proven Strategies to Recover Faster\n\nExercise 3\u20135x a week \u2014 especially weight training. Keep sessions 40\u201360 minutes. Don\u2019t overtrain.\n\nImprove your sleep \u2014 this is when your hormones are restored. Prioritize deep, quality rest.\n\nUse natural supplements and herbs to increase testosterone and dopamine. I personally use AlphaViril \u2014 it has a 25+ year track record and supports both testosterone and dopamine levels.\n\nTake 500 mg of L-Tyrosine, 2\u20133x daily on an empty stomach to boost dopamine production.\n\nYour Porn Detox Game Plan\n\nHere\u2019s what I recommend:\n\nIf you watch porn daily, start with a 1-week break\n\nThen go for 2 weeks \u2014 take note of how you feel, perform, and think\n\n30 days is a solid milestone\n\n90 days is the best-case scenario for a total brain and hormonal reset\n\nReducing or quitting porn may be the fastest way to boost your testosterone, dopamine, and sex drive.\n\nYou\u2019ll have more energy, better focus, stronger erections, and improved confidence.\n\nLet me know how this works for you.

I guess the FTC banned them and now they are doing it again.\n\nSo\u2026 Do Penis Enlargements Pills Work?\n\nTo answer your question about whether they work \u2014 yes and no. Let me explain\u2026\n\nMost of these supplements contain ingredients that help increase testosterone and blood flow to the penis. So, you\u2019ll end up with harder erections.\n\nGranted, most of these supplements also contain junk ingredients or they might be laced with drugs like Viagra.\n\nAny company that makes a claim that\u2019s a total lie can\u2019t be trusted with their advertising, formula, or ingredients.\n\nWhat About AlphaViril?\n\nFor example, AlphaViril is a testosterone booster and hormone optimizer. It has a proven track record for over 25+ years.\n\nHowever, taking AlphaViril by itself will NOT grow your penis.\n\nIt\u2019ll help improve your total and free testosterone levels, boost nitric oxide, and decrease negative hormones such as DHT and estrogen. All of this promotes bigger, harder, and fuller erections.\n\nAlphaViril will increase your libido and sex drive.\n\nBUT, it won\u2019t add a NEW size to your penis.\n\nThe Real Way to Grow Your Penis\n\nHowever, when you combine AlphaViril\u2019s testosterone-boosting benefits with penis exercises designed to lengthen and widen your penis \u2014 THEN yes, you can grow your penis.\n\nBut 4 inches in 4 weeks? NEVER!\n\nMore realistic: \u00bd to 1 inch after 1\u20133 months. It may take longer depending on your consistency with the penis exercise routine.\n\nI have a free email course & guide about this.\n\nI\u2019ve known guys who gained 2 inches in length and almost an inch in diameter \u2014 but that took well over a year, up to 2 years.\n\nNo one is gaining 4 inches in 4 weeks or even 4 years. That\u2019s a scam and a complete lie.\n\nMaybe if you started with 8\u20139 inches\u2026 but seriously \u2014 why would you want it any bigger?\n\nPenis Growth Is About Percentages\n\nThe growth is based more on a percentage.\n\nIf you\u2019re 5 inches erect and gain 20%, that\u2019s 1 inch.\n\nIf you start at 8 inches, 20% growth is about 1.5 inches.\n\nEither way, you will grow your penis \u2014 if you\u2019re dedicated and patient.\n\nHow AlphaViril + Exercises Boost Penis Size\n\nIt\u2019s similar to lifting weights and building muscle.\n\nWhy do some people get bigger muscles faster than others? Genetics plays a big role. Some people are hyper-responders \u2014 almost anything they do works.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key \u2014 guys with the highest testosterone levels build the most muscle \u2014 if all other things are equal.\n\nThis is why women can do the same workout, and get stronger, but never get as big as a man \u2014 they don\u2019t have the testosterone.\n\nHowever, give women testosterone and steroids, and they grow muscle \u2014 as seen in female bodybuilders.\n\nInteresting fact: Women on testosterone often see their clitoris grow \u2014 sometimes up to 2 inches \u2014 with zero effort.\n\nLow Testosterone Shrinks Your Penis\n\nA man\u2019s penis can shrink later in life due to low testosterone and lack of use.\n\nIf you put your arm in a cast, after 4 weeks it shrinks. The same goes for your penis \u2014 use it or lose it.\n\nDoing penis exercises with low testosterone will produce minimal results. But combine those exercises with higher testosterone levels (which AlphaViril helps promote), and your results will dramatically improve.\n\nThe Full Benefits of AlphaViril + Penis Training\n\nAll of this will help:\n\nEnhance sexual stamina\n\nDon\u2019t trust scammy companies claiming their pills can make your penis grow. They\u2019re liars and con artists preying on men\u2019s insecurities.\n\nBelow in the description, I\u2019ve added a link to my free penis-growing email series.\n\nYou\u2019ll get step-by-step instructions, exercises, and routines \u2014 from beginner to advanced. Just like the gym, it\u2019s about progressive improvement.\n\nBut this guide is more than just penis size. It\u2019s about increasing your sex drive and having harder, fuller, and bigger erections by optimizing your hormones.\n\nClick and get instant free access to the guide. And if you have questions, let me know \ud83d\ude42\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/warning-why-caffeine-is-horrible-for-your-health-hormones/",
    "content": "Most of you aren\u2019t going to like today\u2019s topic, because in 2025 most people consume daily, the most abused drug on the planet, and that\u2019s caffeine.\n\nAnd YES, caffeine is a drug. So powerful that Coca-Cola\u2019s original ingredient contained cocaine and they needed a replacement for it and the substitute was and still is, caffeine!\n\nWhether it\u2019s your morning or daily coffee and tea, the usual \u201cenergy drinks\u201d, sodas, pre-workout products or dozens of other \u201cenergy\u201d stimulatory products contain caffeine.\n\nIn fact, most people can\u2019t seem to start the day without getting their \u201ccaffeine hit.\u201d\n\nThe Problems With Caffeine\n\nThe problem with caffeine is that it \u201cburns out\u201d your Central Nervous System and causes numerous, negative changes in your hormones, which ultimately accelerates aging.\n\nThe negative changes in hormones are:\n\nAn increase in stress hormones, such as cortisol \u2014 means more belly fat.\n\nDecrease in testosterone \u2014 this means less muscle and lower libido.\n\nDrop in growth hormone & IGF \u2014 more fat, accelerated aging.\n\nDecrease in thyroid hormones (T3) \u2014 slower metabolism and fat gain.\n\nDrop in adrenal hormones \u2014 DHEA, pregnenolone, etc.\n\nDecrease in melatonin \u2014 sleep and anti-aging hormone.\n\nIncrease in estrogen \u2014 breast health problems, gynecomastia (\u201cMan Boobs\u201d), irregular menstruation\n\nHigher blood sugar and insulin insensitivity \u2014 more fat, less muscle, etc.\n\nAnother major issue is neurological in that it causes issues by decreasing dopamine release and dopamine receptor sensitivity \u2014 both are bad because it decreases happiness.\n\nIt also causes a decrease in another neurotransmitter, serotonin. This means again, less happiness, more worry, stress, anxiety, and panic.\n\nOther Problems With Caffeine\n\nOther health problems that are non-hormonal:\n\nOxidative stress and inflammation \u2014 related to numerous health problems, aches and pains\n\nPH imbalance (more acidic) \u2014 acid reflux, osteoporosis, gut bacterium imbalances\n\nInsomnia & poor sleep (shallow REM sleep) \u2014 the cause of too many health problems and hormonal imbalances.\n\nBlood Pressure problems\n\nHonestly, I can go on and on.\n\nMy Love/Hate With Caffeine\n\nAnd trust me when I tell you that when I take a little bit of caffeine, I feel AMAZING. I honestly do. I\u2019m happy, very productive, and just more focused.\n\nBut I\u2019ve done so many tests with it and no matter what I do, within a few days my body adapts, I need to increase the dose and my hormones start to change for the worst \u2014 as does my sleep.\n\nAnd people who I\u2019ve tested who habitually consume caffeine daily, for years and years (like most of us) \u2014 trust me, they have a lot of health issues.\n\nBUT NOT ONCE, will a doctor say \u201cget off the caffeine, it\u2019s killing you.\u201d\n\nCaffeine IS A Powerful & Addictive Drug\n\nThis is because nobody even thinks of caffeine as a drug. And \u201ceverybody does it.\u201d\n\nRemember, it is a very potent drug and works in many ways, the same as Cocaine. And both are \u201cnatural\u201d and found in \u201cnature.\u201d\n\nBut they are not to be consumed in highly concentrated sources as we do in modern society.\n\nAnyway, like I said \u2014 I really like how I feel on caffeine, I just don\u2019t like to deal with the negatives \u2013 especially the hormonal imbalances.\n\nSo, what does this mean?\n\nBecause I know right now most people are thinking \u201cumm\u2026 no way am I gonna stop my caffeine, I love my coffee, etc., etc.\u201d\n\nThe Good News \u2013 Natural Alternatives\n\nHowever, the GOOD NEWS is that there are much safer, healthier, and even better solutions \u2014 natural herbs, plant extracts, and amino acids that will help support the healthy energy levels and focus you need, but without any of the negative side effects that I\u2019ve mentioned today.\n\nNo crash. No negative hormonal changes.\n\nPlus, they are actually GOOD for your health \u2014 body AND especially mind. Better for memory, cognition, and mood.\n\nThey actually help improve your hormones and neurotransmitters. They have anti-aging benefits, especially for your mind.\n\nIf you still want to have your caffeine products, go ahead\u2026 but consider lowering the dose and use much healthier and better solutions.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

More body fat also means more estrogen and this also decreases testosterone.\n\nInflammation causes insulin resistance, as does higher body fat, stress levels, and so forth. Insulin resistance further decreases testosterone levels.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is testosterone itself has ANTI-inflammatory properties, which is a good thing.\n\nAnd as inflammation increases, you have less testosterone and as you have less testosterone, you have more inflammation.\n\nInflammation is bad for you, especially for testosterone levels, libido, and mood.\n\nLiving an anti-inflammatory lifestyle with the proper diet, exercise program, and stress management is very important and of course, it takes time, effort, persistence, and patience.\n\nYou can help support a healthy inflammatory response by taking two natural supplements:\n\nFish oils \u2013 take at least 2 grams daily. I take 6 grams. Costco has a good quality one. That\u2019s 2-6 pills daily. I take NOW Foods Oil since it\u2019s cheaper than the pills.\n\nInflame & Pain Relief \u2013 this amazing all-in-one formula attacks both inflammation and pain from multiple pathways and this is why it\u2019s so effective.\n\nInflame & Pain Relief has over a dozen, clinically validated and researched ingredients, including 6 patented ones. It\u2019s like 5 products in 1.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/better-sex-bigger-erections-almost-instantly/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about how you can have better sex and bigger, fuller erections, almost instantly\u2026 and do so naturally. No prescription drugs or injections.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how rich or poor, young or old, good-looking or not \u2013 when you can\u2019t perform, you lose all your confidence. This can mess things up in the future because you start thinking and anxiety, adrenalin, etc. break everything.\n\nYou need to improve blood flow and testosterone.\n\nNitric Oxide For Better Sex\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about Nitric Oxide, which helps with blood flow.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of Viagra and Cilias. These are PDE5 inhibitors.\n\nThey inhibit this enzyme, which then increases Nitric Oxide levels and leads to better blood flow and erections.\n\nHowever, for many people, these drugs don\u2019t work. The older you are, the less effective they are. And with continued use, they work less and less.\n\nMost importantly, these drugs work much better with higher testosterone levels, which is why they don\u2019t work as well in older men with low testosterone.\n\nAnd there are lots of reasons for this. However, one reason is that high testosterone also produces more nitric oxide.\n\nSecondly, it\u2019s also a good idea to give your body the raw materials it needs, to help produce more Nitric Oxide \u2013 which then allows these drugs, Viagra and Cialis to work better.\n\nSupplements to Boost Nitric Oxide\n\nThere are two popular amino acids for boosting Nitric Oxide, L arginine and L Citrulline.\n\nL-arginine is a direct precursor to nitric oxide, which is good.\n\nUnfortunately, most of it is often broken down before reaching the target tissues. So, it\u2019s not absorbed or utilized as well.\n\nHowever, L citrulline is better because it directly converts to L-arginine in the kidneys. This conversion process leads to a higher concentration of L-arginine available for nitric oxide synthesis.\n\nEven though taking Citrulline is a 2 step process, it\u2019s more efficient and effective.\n\nSo, that\u2019s why I suggest taking L Citrulline instead of arginine. Some combine the two, but that\u2019s up to you to try.\n\nAs far as the dose, studies recommend taking about 2 grams, 3x daily. That\u2019s 2000 mg, 3x daily.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re going to use it for sexual performance reasons, take about 3-6 grams at once, 30 minutes before sexual activity.\n\nStart with a lower dose of 3,000 mg and work up to 6,000 mg if needed.\n\nYou can take it in pill form. But I just buy the powder because it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nI take a big teaspoon in my mouth and wash it down with water.\n\nMost Effective Solution\n\nNow, there are other supplements that help improve nitric oxide production. Some of the best ones are:\n\nPine bark extract \u2013 Pycnogenol\n\nThen there are other ingredients that help promote better blood flow and circulation, such as:\n\nHorse chestnut extract\n\nSo, combining these ingredients, with L-Citrulline makes everything work better.\n\nFor me, I take a product called Blood Flow Optimizer, which has all of these ingredients and other vitamins as well. I take this daily because I want to preserve youthful and healthy long-term blood flow and circulation.\n\nNot just \u201cas-needed\u201d, short-term goals. I want to make sure the veins and arteries are healthy, and elastic, and don\u2019t have plaque buildup and so forth.\n\nAnd then, I take about 5 grams of Citrulline before sexual activity.\n\nSometimes I take it before the gym for a better pump.\n\nI don\u2019t take Citrilline daily because I notice it doesn\u2019t work as well when I take it all the time. So, I use it as needed, to get the most benefits and to prevent my body from adapting to it.\n\nAnd remember, the higher your testosterone levels are naturally, the better all of this works because higher testosterone levels also increase nitric oxide levels.\n\nSo, my personal formula is :\n\nAlphaViril daily \u2013 which helps optimize my testosterone levels and hormonal balance with estrogen, DHT, and so forth.\n\nI take Blood Flow Optimizer daily to help promote healthy circulation.\n\nI take 5 grams of Citrulline powder, about 30 minutes before sexual activity.\n\nLet me know how it works for you\u2026\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

She noticed he\u2019d been more aggressive lately and worried that higher testosterone might lead to violent behavior, like the infamous \u201croid rage\u201d seen in steroid users.\n\nSo, does more testosterone really make you aggressive?\n\nThe answer might surprise you.\n\nThe Real Cause of Aggression: It\u2019s Not Testosterone\n\nMany people think testosterone makes men violent\u2014but that\u2019s not true.\n\nIn fact, new studies show that estrogen is actually the hormone linked to aggression.\n\nTestosterone does increase drive, motivation, and competitiveness, which are good things.\n\nBut when testosterone levels rise too high alongside estrogen, that\u2019s when problems can start.\n\nWhy Do Some Men Become Aggressive on Steroids?\n\nThe aggressive behavior linked to steroid use \u2013 often called \u201croid rage\u201d \u2013 isn\u2019t just from testosterone.\n\nMany steroids convert into estrogen in the body.\n\nHigh estrogen levels lead to mood swings and aggression.\n\nDHT (dihydrotestosterone), another hormone, can increase with steroid use, which may also contribute to irritability.\n\nHow Hormones Change As Men Age\n\nAs men get older, their hormone balance shifts:\n\nTestosterone levels drop naturally.\n\nEstrogen levels rise due to increased body fat and environmental factors.\n\nDHT levels increase, which can lead to hair loss, prostate growth, and mood issues.\n\nThis is why some older men feel more irritable, moody, or aggressive\u2014it\u2019s not from too much testosterone, but from too much estrogen and DHT.\n\nThe Ideal Hormone Balance for Men\n\nTo feel your best, you want to:\n\nIncrease testosterone naturally\n\nKeep estrogen at a moderate level\n\nPrevent excessive DHT buildup\n\nWhen your hormones are balanced, you\u2019ll experience:\n\nBetter muscle growth & fat loss\n\nHigher libido & stronger erections\n\nMore motivation & drive\n\nNo mood swings or aggression\n\nHow to Boost Testosterone Without Raising Estrogen or DHT\n\nIf you want to increase testosterone safely while keeping estrogen and DHT in check, there are natural methods that can help.\n\nWatch the full video above to learn exactly how testosterone, estrogen, and DHT affect your body \u2013 and what you can do to optimize your hormone levels naturally.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

It\u2019s when your body produces key hormones like testosterone and reduces stress hormones like cortisol.\n\nPoor sleep can have a major impact on testosterone levels.\n\nJust a couple of nights of inadequate rest can cause testosterone to drop by 20%\u201350%.\n\nThat\u2019s why men often wake up with morning erections\u2014it\u2019s a sign of a healthy testosterone peak. This is also why libido and performance tend to be better during the day rather than at night.\n\nIf you\u2019re not prioritizing sleep, your testosterone will never be at its best. No supplement, workout, or diet can fully make up for the negative effects of chronic sleep deprivation.\n\nYour Testosterone Won\u2019t Improve Without Good Sleep\n\nI\u2019ve talked about testosterone boosters like AlphaViril before, and while they help, they won\u2019t work if you\u2019re not sleeping well.\n\nIt\u2019s like going to the gym and eating junk food\u2014you\u2019re sabotaging your progress.\n\nMost guys aren\u2019t sleeping well, and they don\u2019t even realize it. Here are some of the biggest mistakes that hurt testosterone and overall health:\n\nLate-night phone use \u2013 Blue light disrupts melatonin production and delays sleep.\n\nGoing to bed too late \u2013 Deep, restorative sleep happens earlier in the night.\n\nNot allowing enough time in bed \u2013 If you want 7 hours of sleep, you need at least 8 hours in bed.\n\nToo much caffeine \u2013 Stimulants can affect sleep quality, even if taken earlier in the day.\n\nLate-night workouts \u2013 Exercising too late keeps the nervous system overactive, making it harder to relax.\n\nDo Men Need Less Sleep Than Women?\n\nIt\u2019s true that most men need less sleep than women. Every girlfriend I\u2019ve had could sleep 9\u201310 hours, while I personally need about 6\u20137 hours.\n\nHowever, I used to push myself on just 5 hours a night, and even though I \u201cfunctioned,\u201d I was sluggish and unfocused.\n\nWhen you\u2019re young, you might get away with little sleep, but as you get older, it wrecks your hormones, energy, and focus.\n\nMake Sleep a Priority for Better Health, Hormones, and Sex Drive\n\nBetter cognition and focus\n\nImproved mood and energy\n\nThen start prioritizing better sleep.\n\nWatch the full video above to learn exactly how sleep affects your hormones and what you can do to fix it.\n\nI\u2019ve also prepared my best tips, blogs, and videos on optimizing sleep, boosting testosterone, and improving overall health.\n\nImportant \"Deep Quality Sleep\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for improving your sleep - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with sleep!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve \"deep quality sleep\" with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/10-shocking-health-risks-of-not-having-sex/",
    "content": "Sex is always a hot topic for most people. Unfortunately, today\u2019s topic is about the top 10 shocking health risks and problems of NOT having sex for a while.\n\nAnd I bring this up because, in the past few years, there\u2019s been a huge DECLINE in people having sex, especially men.\n\nFor example, in men between the ages of 18-24, there\u2019s a 31% increase in reporting \u201cNO sexual activity for the past 12 months\u201d\n\nAlso, inactivity has increased by 14% in men between 25-34.\n\nEven with couples who live together, sexual activity has dropped by as much as 23%.\n\nNow, what are the potential causes and the solutions?\n\nI\u2019ll get to that at the end of this article.\n\nBut for now, let\u2019s start with the 10 health risks.\n\nBy the way, #10 is my favorite because there was an episode of Seinfeld about it. It\u2019s super funny\u2026\n\n10 Health Risks Of Not Having Sex\n\n1. Erectile Dysfunction\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cUse it or lose it\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s right, in a 2008 study in The American Journal of Medicine, abstinence and not having sex, increases the likelihood of erectile dysfunction and impotence.\n\nI\u2019ll give you the reasons for this later.\n\nHowever, not ejaculating regularly can also cause prostate growth and possibly prostate cancer.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the good news is that you can ejaculate on your own \u2013 so at least do that 1-2x a week for healthy prostate function.\n\nNot having sex causes erectile problems in men.\n\nIn women, some will say that the vagina will get smaller and tighter \u2013 which might be a positive benefit for some women and their partners.\n\nOr, the vagina might start to grow cobwebs\u2026 which I\u2019m just joking.\n\nHowever, the truth is that a woman\u2019s pelvic floor muscles will get weaker and atrophy and shrink.\n\nThis can lead to bladder problems, urine leakage, and incontinence.\n\nThis is a problem in older women and one big reason is the lack of sex and of course, a weaker pelvic floor muscle.\n\nThis can be fixed by doing Kegel Exercises. I\u2019ve done a video about this in the past so take a look if you want.\n\n3. No Sex \u2013 Lowered Immune System\n\nNot having sex can lower your immune system.\n\nThe act of connecting with someone, touching, smelling, and the cardiovascular exercise of having sex all boost your immune system.\n\nSorry, masturbation doesn\u2019t replace this.\n\nThere\u2019s a decrease in libido and sex drive when you don\u2019t have sex for a while.\n\nSomething interesting to note is that Sex is not a drive that becomes more and more prominent without it \u2013 like hunger.\n\nSex is a reward system, and when we\u2019re having good sex, we want more good sex.\n\nAnd the opposite is true\u2026 After a while of not having sex, you think about it and crave it less.\n\nThis causes a decrease in youth hormones.\n\nNot having sex can for sure cause negative changes in your mood and this affects both men and women, but differently.\n\nFor most women, sex is more emotional. They feel most loved and connected. Thus, not having sex can cause them to feel unloved, depressed, anxious, and more stressed.\n\nIt\u2019s not just emotional either because when you have sex, there\u2019s a release of \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cbonding\u201d chemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin.\n\nIn men, it\u2019s different in that when they don\u2019t have sex, their self-esteem lowers. Their stress hormones such as cortisol also increase, causing them to feel more agitated, short-tempered, and angry.\n\nNothing makes a man feel important, happy, more giving, and relaxed like sex.\n\nOn the flip side, not having sex for a while when you\u2019re in a relationship, can cause insecurities about your relationship. This causes worry, jealousy and anxiety.\n\n6. Lack Of Sex & Decrease In Testosterone\n\nAs stated earlier, there can be an increase in stress hormones such as cortisol.\n\nWell, as cortisol levels increase, testosterone levels decrease in both men and women, but especially in men.\n\nWhen testosterone levels drop, you\u2019ll have less DESIRE to have sex. A lowered libido.\n\nPhysically, this can lead to erectile problems in men and vaginal dryness in women.\n\nIt\u2019s a negative circle because when you have less desire or you can\u2019t physically perform sexually, then you\u2019ll end up having LESS sex. And less sex further decreases your testosterone levels.\n\nAnd remember, testosterone is the primary hormone in both men and women, which controls your sexual desire and performance.\n\n7. No Sex \u2013 Less Intelligence & Poor Memory\n\nThere was an episode of Seinfeld where Elaine stopped having sex with her boyfriend so he could study more and become a doctor.\n\nWhile at the same time, George stopped having sex with his girlfriend because of a medical thing she was going through.\n\nWell\u2026 the outcome was the total opposite.\n\nElain became dumb and forgetful. While George became much smarter.\n\nSo, which is it? Does NOT having sex make you smarter or dumber?\n\nMore or less intelligent?\n\nScientists have demonstrated that sexual activity boosts neuron growth in the brain\u2019s hippocampus.\n\nThis means that having sex is good for your brain, as well as your body.\n\nNow, in the case of the episode of Seinfeld, because George couldn\u2019t have sex for a few weeks, his brain was not consumed by sex and it caused him to be more productive \u2013 which I find to be accurate.\n\nHowever, not having sex doesn\u2019t make you more intelligent\u2026 as far as the research has shown.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t People Not Having Sex?\n\nSo the real question is, why aren\u2019t people not having as much sex?\n\nWell, there are lots of reasons I\u2019m sure. A big one is that most people are consumed by their phones and the internet. So, they aren\u2019t interacting with other people in the real world, in person.\n\nEspecially men \u2013 who are already not very social compared to women.\n\nAdd in all the porn they can consume at their fingertips, anywhere, anytime, any place \u2026 and the desire to seek out women, to talk to them, and be intimate has been decreased.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another major factor to all of this and that\u2019s the fact that testosterone levels have plummeted over the past few decades. It\u2019s probably half what it used to be just 40-50 years ago.\n\nAnd, this also affects women too.\n\nYES, testosterone controls sexual desire and performance in both men and women.\n\nAnd YES, women have more testosterone than they do estrogen\u2026 just like men do.\n\nWe just have different total amounts of each.\n\nSo the point of all of this is that when you have low testosterone, your desire for sex has decreased tremendously. It\u2019s just not on your mind.\n\nAnd many men also have erectile problems. So, even IF they do want to have sex, they are worried and concerned about their ability to perform sexually. To get an erection and maintain it.\n\nSo, this further causes men to retract inward and become isolated.\n\nThe bottom line is that NOT having regular sex is not healthy for your body and mind.\n\nIt\u2019s not good for your self-esteem or your relationship.\n\nAnd all of this is linked to lowered testosterone levels.\n\nSo my suggestion is to naturally maximize your testosterone levels.\n\nSecondly, you need to put yourself out there and start interacting with people. Human contact is very important for health.\n\nYour phone and the internet are NOT a substitute for a human. Use it to keep in touch and maintain relationships. But in person is what causes relationships to grow and create sexual chemistry.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/all-about-sex/202106/why-people-are-having-so-much-less-sex\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-017-0953-1\n\nhttps://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343%2808%2900314-8/abstract\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022146516661597?journalCode=hsbb\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2734290/\n\nhttps://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(08)00314-8/fulltext\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022146516661597?journalCode=hsbb\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2539416/How-sex-make-smarter-Scientists-say-encourages-growth-brain-cells-improves-long-term-memory.html\n\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/how-sex-affects-intelligence-and-vice-versa/282889/",

    "content": "Today, I want to talk about a huge misconception\u2014the idea that men are always ready for sex, anytime, anywhere.\n\nThere\u2019s this belief that we can just flip a switch, get an erection on demand, and perform effortlessly.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how it works. In fact, this unrealistic expectation creates a lot of pressure, which actually makes things worse.\n\nJust the other day, a friend of mine told me he broke up with his girlfriend because of sexual performance issues.\n\nShe expected him to be \u201con\u201d whenever she wanted it, and when he wasn\u2019t, she assumed he was either cheating or not attracted to her. That kind of pressure kills a man\u2019s confidence and makes performance anxiety even worse.\n\nThe Media Creates Unrealistic Expectations\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen it in movies\u2014two people come home from a date, and within seconds, the guy is ready to go. Or in adult films, men seem to get hard instantly and perform like machines.\n\nBut let me tell you the truth\u2026 even professional adult film stars can\u2019t do it naturally.\n\nWhen I worked at a gym in Southern California, I met a lot of guys in the adult film industry, and they all told me the same thing:\n\nThey use Viagra or injections to stay hard.\n\nThey struggle because of cameras, lights, and pressure.\n\nEven the \u201cpros\u201d aren\u2019t always ready\u2014so why should regular guys be?\n\nWhy Men\u2019s Sex Drive Changes Over Time\n\nWhen you\u2019re young (teens & early 20s), your hormones are through the roof, and everything is new and exciting. Getting aroused is easy.\n\nBut as you get older, things change:\n\nTestosterone levels drop\n\nStress increases (work, relationships, responsibilities)\n\nPorn use can desensitize you\n\nSex usually happens at night\u2014when you\u2019re tired\n\nMale sex drive is at its peak in the morning & early day \u2013 when testosterone is highest, making it easier to get aroused.\n\nIt\u2019s Time to Break the Myth\n\nMen aren\u2019t robots. We don\u2019t have an \u201corgasm button\u201d that works on demand.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/this-causes-280-increase-in-erectile-dysfunction/",
    "content": "If you\u2019ve seen my videos in the past, you know I\u2019ve mentioned the different causes of erectile problems in men.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken about hormonal imbalances, such as low testosterone, high estrogen, and cortisol levels\u2026 and low dopamine levels.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken about poor blood flow and low nitric oxide levels.\n\nI\u2019ve also mentioned other factors such as high pressure, blood sugar, and inflammation.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s one I haven\u2019t spoken about in the past and it\u2019s something I saw on The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Barlett.\n\nSo, two very important things I want to mention now in 2025, and one of them is what Steven did at the very end of this clip that can actually cause erectile dysfunction that they didn\u2019t mention in the interview.\n\nBut, I\u2019ll get to that in a minute\u2026\n\nOral Health And Erectile Dysfunction\n\nFirst, the topic is gum disease and oral health.\n\nMost people do not take good care of their teeth. I\u2019ve made a video about this in the past.\n\nBut you really need to focus on improving your oral health, especially if you\u2019re a guy and concerned about getting erections\u2026. Or even getting laid to begin with.\n\nBad bacteria in your mouth, coupled with the inflammation, lowers blood flow and thus, can indirectly cause erectile problems.\n\nAs you saw in the video, Dr. Victoria Sampson said men who have periodontal or gum disease are 280% more likely to have erectile dysfunction.\n\nAdd in sub-optimal hormone levels, stress, and poor blood flow from aging, and that 280% increase in erectile problems will be much worse\n\nOn a similar note, there are many times I speak to guys and they have bad breath.\n\nThat may not be gum disease YET\u2026 But the bad breath is from bad bacteria. Yes, that\u2019s from poor eating, incorrect gut bacteria and from bad oral hygiene and basically don\u2019t doing a good job of keeping your mouth clean.\n\nSure, your focus is improving your erections. But, if you have bad breath, you\u2019re not even going to get laid to begin with.\n\nMouthwash Causes Erectile Dysfunction?\n\nBefore I give you some simple solutions, I want to also mention the end of the clip again:\n\nYou\u2019ll notice Steven was going to take a swig of mouthwash to kill the bad bacteria in his mouth. You know, he was just joking around.\n\nThis is what most people do \u2013 take mouthwash to kill bacteria and improve fresh breath.\n\nHowever, did you know that mouthwash can cause erectile problems?\n\nYup, I made a video about this years ago. Here\u2019s what the PubMed Study states:\n\nShort-term clinical trials have shown that antibacterial mouthwash depletes oral nitrate-reducing bacteria, and decreases systemic nitric oxide bioavailability.\n\nNitric Oxide is what causes erections. This is how drugs like Viagra and Cialis work, by increasing nitric oxide levels.\n\nWhich apparently, mouthwash can DECREASE.\n\nAdditionally, the study revealed that 12% of men using mouthwash developed hypertension and thus, high blood pressure.\n\nAnd those using mouthwash twice daily had an even higher incidence of hypertension compared to less frequent users.\n\nAnd if you didn\u2019t know, high blood pressure is linked to erectile problems. In fact, Viagra was originally a blood pressure drug. The SIDE benefit was erections.\n\nSo, they took the active ingredient which is Sildenfil in the blood pressure drug called Revatio.\n\nThen, renamed the SAME drug Viagra, rebranded it for Erectile Dysfunction, increased the price of the same drug by 10-fold, and then made billions of dollars.\n\nThe bottom line is that mouthwash may not be good for erections or blood pressure.\n\nSo, let\u2019s give you some action plans so you can get laid more and have better erections and healthy blood pressure.\n\nHere\u2019s what I do and something you should consider:\n\nBrush your teeth at least twice daily, I do it after every meal. I also use an electric toothbrush for better cleaning.\n\nThen, floss your teeth after brushing, at least twice a day. For sure before bed at night.\n\nFinally, I use a water pick. This stuff is amazing.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t rush through it all. Spend at least 2-3 minutes on all of this. Make it a daily habit.\n\nAnd if you want to improve your erections \u2013 these are my favorite solutions. Take a look, then take action, and don\u2019t improve your oral hygiene.\n\nI promise you, if you ignore this simple task, you\u2019ll just make your erections and overall health much worse.\n\nBesides, nobody likes going to the dentist and then finding out you have a stupid cavity, right?\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/herbal-testosterone-booster-results/",
    "content": "\"Increase My Libido & Testosterone\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb One of the most frequently asked topics is about testosterone and how to naturally boost it using herbal solutions.\n\nTestosterone plays a critical role in energy, muscle building, libido, and overall health. While herbal testosterone boosters are effective, there are a couple of things to remember.\n\nBelow are the highlights, but for a full breakdown, watch the video at the top of this page for detailed insights and actionable steps.\n\nWhat Are Herbal Testosterone Boosters?\n\nHerbal testosterone boosters, like Alpha Viril, work with your body to naturally enhance testosterone levels, unlike synthetic drugs that force rapid hormonal changes.\n\nThese boosters can help:\n\nIncrease energy and stamina\n\nImprove erections and libido\n\nEnhance mood and mental clarity\n\nSupport muscle growth and recovery\n\nAs they work with your body naturally, patience and consistency are key. Depending on your current health and lifestyle, results may take days, weeks, or even months.\n\nThey don\u2019t work like a magic pill, the right booster can significantly improve your hormonal health when paired with a good lifestyle.\n\nWhy Cycling is Essential?\n\nOne of the most important lessons I\u2019ve learned in over 25 years of using testosterone boosters is the need to cycle your supplements.\n\nContinuous use of any product can lead to diminished results as your body adapts. Here are a few effective cycling methods:\n\nWeekly Cycling: Take it 5 days on, 2 days off.\n\nMonthly Cycling: Use for 3 weeks, then take 1 week off.\n\nDose Cycling: Start with a lower dose (2 pills daily), then gradually increase every two weeks (up to 8 pills if needed).\n\nCycling not only helps maintain effectiveness but also gives your body a chance to reset, preventing adaptation and saving money in the long run.\n\nHerbal Testosterone Boosters Results\n\nResults from herbal testosterone boosters vary widely based on individual factors like age, health, and current testosterone levels.\n\nHere are some common experiences:\n\nImmediate Effects: Some users report stronger erections and improved libido within days.\n\nGradual Improvements: For others, it takes weeks or months to see noticeable changes, like increased energy or muscle growth.\n\nBlood Test Changes: Users often see significant increases in testosterone levels. For example, one user reported going from 500 ng/dL to 750 ng/dL in just two months.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that results depend on consistency and lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and sleep.\n\nHerbal Testosterone Boosters & Hormonal Health\n\nTestosterone is just one piece of the puzzle. A good herbal booster doesn\u2019t only increase testosterone\u2014it helps balance other critical hormones like:\n\nCortisol: High stress reduces testosterone.\n\nEstrogen: Excess estrogen can lead to fat gain and hormonal imbalances.\n\nProlactin: Elevated levels increase recovery time between erections (refractory period).\n\nNitric Oxide: Improved blood flow leads to better erections and cardiovascular health.\n\nBy addressing all these factors, herbal testosterone boosters ensure a more holistic approach to hormonal health.\n\nLifestyle: The Foundation of Hormonal Health\n\nSupplements can amplify your results, but they\u2019re not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to prioritize:\n\nExercise Regularly: Focus on weightlifting and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for maximum benefits.\n\nEat a Balanced Diet: Include healthy fats, lean proteins, and whole foods. Avoid processed junk that disrupts hormones.\n\nGet Quality Sleep: Deep sleep is when your body produces the most testosterone.\n\nHydrate and De-Stress: Chronic stress and dehydration harm testosterone production.\n\nKey Benefits of Herbal Testosterone Boosters\n\nHerbal boosters are a safe and effective way to improve your health.\n\nHere are some of the main benefits:\n\nImproved Sexual Performance: Stronger erections and increased libido are often the first noticeable changes.\n\nBetter Energy Levels: More stamina for workouts, work, and everyday life.\n\nEnhanced Muscle Growth: Combine it with strength training for maximum results.\n\nImproved Confidence: Hormonal balance impacts your mood, outlook, and self-esteem.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering an herbal testosterone booster, remember that patience is key.\n\nThese supplements work naturally, and results take time. While some see immediate benefits, most people need a few weeks to a few months to notice significant changes.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of cycling methods, lifestyle tips, and real user feedback, watch the full video at the top of this page.\n\nYou\u2019ll get actionable advice and deeper insights into maximizing your results.\n\nDon\u2019t wait\u2014start optimizing your testosterone levels today.

    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025 I\u2019m going to talk about dopamine and how it relates to your sex drive and erections.\n\nHere\u2019s something most people don\u2019t know.\n\nThe excitatory system in animals, including humans, increases drive and libido\u2026 Thus, improving your sexual performance and increasing your sex drive.\n\nOn the opposite side, the inhibitory system stimulates sexual reward, sedation, and satiety.\n\nBasically, you\u2019re not \u201chungry\u201d anymore\u2026 This kills your sexual drive.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for better erections, you need to stimulate the excitatory system and NOT the inhibitory system.\n\nDopamine: The Core Excitatory System\n\nSo, how do you do this?\u2026\n\nWell, the core excitatory system in your brain is the dopamine system.\n\nWhich is linked to the hypothalamus and limbic systems, and includes melanocortins (MC), oxytocin (OT), and norepinephrine (NE).\n\nOn the opposite side, the inhibitory system contains brain opioids, endocannabinoid (ECB), and serotonin (5-HT) systems that are activated during periods of sexual inhibition and blunt the excitatory system.\n\nThis is why inhibitory drugs that increase serotonin, such as SSRI\u2019s like Prozac and similar antidepressant drugs, cause a decrease in libido and your ability to get an erection and achieve an orgasm.\n\nThese drugs also negatively affect women\u2019s sexual desire as well.\n\nTo keep it simple, drugs that are downers are more inhibitory. Drugs that are uppers are more excitatory.\n\nTestosterone and Sexual Performance\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about hormones.\n\nIn both men and women, testosterone increases dopamine and thus, increases your desire to have sex.\n\nTestosterone also increases the synthesis of Nitric Oxide, which helps improve blood flow to the penis and the clitoris.\n\nFor men, this means bigger, fuller, and harder erections.\n\nSo, increasing testosterone naturally from within should be your primary goal if you want a higher sex drive and harder erections.\n\nBoth because of what testosterone does directly as the primary sex hormone\u2026. But also what testosterone does indirectly with the increase in dopamine, a neurotransmitter.\n\nOn the other hand, you want to minimize the inhibitory system, and that means not taking drugs that increase serotonin such as antidepressants.\n\nAnd also reducing, minimizing, or eliminating marijuana and even alcohol.\n\nThese drugs are inhibitory, not stimulatory.\n\nNatural Ways to Boost Testosterone\n\nAs far as this first solution of how to increase testosterone levels naturally, from within. I\u2019ve covered this many times before in previous videos.\n\nYou can do so with improvements in your lifestyle by eating better, exercising more, improving your sleep, and reducing stress.\n\nIf you want faster results, you can take specific herbs that help increase both testosterone and dopamine levels.\n\nThe product I\u2019ve been using for 25 years is AlphaViril. It does all of these hormone optimizations and has additional benefits for improving erections.\n\nIncrease Dopamine Levels\n\nNow, this is a complex topic because there are 3 variables.\n\nReduce things that deplete your dopamine.\n\nIncrease your sensitivity to dopamine at the receptors.\n\nI\u2019m going to make a detailed video about these 3 factors in a future video soon, so make sure you\u2019re subscribed to my channel so you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s released.\n\n5 Dopamine-Increasing Solutions\n\n[1] Consume the amino acid, L Tyrosine\n\nIt\u2019s needed for dopamine production. I take 500 \u2013 1000 mg, 2-3x daily. Do so on an empty stomach.\n\nI take it first thing in the morning and before my workouts. Don\u2019t take it too late in the day as it could cause sleep problems.\n\nAlso, another great supplement for improving dopamine levels is Velvet Bean 25% Extract, which contains L-dopa. I take 100 mg, 2x daily or more.\n\nThe good news is that this is already found in AlphaViril.\n\nCombined with other testosterone-boosting herbs, it has a very positive synergistic effect on libido and erections.\n\n[2] Make sure you get enough deep-quality sleep\n\nSleep optimizes all of your youth hormones and neurotransmitters while reducing stress hormones.\n\nIf you have to wake up to an alarm, you\u2019re not sleeping enough.\n\nGo to bed earlier. If you have a hard time falling asleep or staying asleep, take natural herbs. I take Deep Sleep Formula every night because it works really well and I don\u2019t wake up groggy.\n\n[3] Exercise daily or at least 3-5x weekly\n\nLifting weights helps increase both testosterone and dopamine levels.\n\nPlus, you\u2019ll feel more confident with the extra muscle, which is always good for dopamine levels.\n\n[4] Get sunlight and take extra Vitamin D3 and K2\n\nMost people are deficient or have low levels of Vitamin D.\n\nVitamin D3 is actually a hormone, not a vitamin. It\u2019s very powerful, especially for testosterone and dopamine levels.\n\nI take 1 pill of Perfect Vitamin D&K daily during the summer and 2 pills during the winter.\n\nIt also helps boost your immune system and bone density and has so many health benefits.\n\nRemember, take Vit D3 with K2, they work together.\n\n[5] Manage your stress levels\n\nWhen cortisol levels go up, testosterone levels come down. Also, dopamine levels get depleted and cause receptor damage.\n\nSleep is super important for lowering cortisol levels. Also, limiting outside stress from the news and negative people is very important.\n\nUnfortunately, the outside world is much harder to control. That\u2019s why I take herbs such as ashwagandha, phosphatidylserine, emodin, and others to help lower my stress hormones.\n\nI take Stress & Cortisol Relief during times of stress or in the evening when you want to lower cortisol levels before sleep.\n\nSo those are 5 proven ways to improve both your testosterone and dopamine levels.\n\nThe bottom line is if you want to improve your libido and sexual performance, and improve your mood and confidence \u2013 you need to optimize your dopamine levels.\n\nIncreasing your testosterone levels.\n\nImproving dopamine production and sensitivity.\n\nReducing stress hormones.\n\nI\u2019ll do a more detailed video in the future. However, this is a great start\u2026\n\nNow it\u2019s up to you to take action and not just passively listen like most people do.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to make these improvements. You deserve it. You\u2019ll feel so much better in life having optimal hormone levels.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to simplify the topic of increasing your \u201ctestosterone & libido\u201d. I\u2019m going to clarify all the silly misunderstandings about this important subject.\n\nI would say that 95% of the information you hear about this topic \u2014 online, articles, blogs, YouTube and so forth \u2014 it\u2019s ALL WRONG!\n\nThese so-called \u2018experts\u2019 list foods such as:\n\n\u201cspecial\u201d fruits or vegetables that have lots of good vitamins \u2026\n\nspicy foods or alcohol because they may increase your blood flow \u2026\n\nbeans or meat because they have healthy protein \u2026\n\nwhole grains because they have fiber and help with weight loss\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of \u201cstuff\u201d that *may* help a LITTLE\u2026 but they NEVER address the REAL problem and CAUSE of low libido, which is a HORMONAL IMBALANCE!\n\nIf your sex drive and libido isn\u2019t where you\u2019d like it to be or where it used to be.\n\nYou have a hard time getting or maintaining an erection.\n\nIf you\u2019re just not \u201cdriven\u201d \u2014 mentally, physically or emotionally \u2014 when it comes to sex or just life in general.\n\nThen the problem is hormonal imbalance which typically means:\n\nLESS \u201cpro-sexual\u201d hormones \u2013 such as testosterone.\n\nMORE \u201canti-sexual\u201d hormones \u2013 such as estrogen, prolactin and cortisol\n\nSo now our goal is to\u2026\n\nIncrease Your \u201cGood\u201d Hormones & Decrease The \u201cBad\u201d Ones\n\n\u2026 and one of the best ways to do this is to\n\nEat FAT To Increase Testosterone & Libido\n\nThe best type of food that increases testosterone is FAT and more specifically, saturated fats and cholesterol.\n\nNow, you might be freaking out and thinking \u201cOkay Dr. Sam \u2014 you\u2019re insane!!! My cholesterol is going to go through the roof and I\u2019m going to have a heart attack!\u201d\n\nFirst of all, over 80% of the cholesterol found in your blood and arteries is NOT from foods you eat \u2014 but produced from your LIVER!1\n\nFats Produce Hormones\n\nCholesterol and saturated fats help produce most of your sex hormones \u2013 especially testosterone.\n\nCholesterol helps lower your stress hormone, cortisol \u2014 which does the OPPOSITE of testosterone.\n\nIn fact, without cholesterol, you\u2019d die eventually.\n\nAging Is The Real Problem For Low Testosterone & Libido\n\nAnd for those of you who are really concerned about having high cholesterol \u2014 the PRIMARY cause of high cholesterol is AGING and the negative change in your hormones!!!\n\nThis is why the older you get, the worse your cholesterol levels. This is why women who go through menopause start having high cholesterol.\n\nAgain, it all comes down to a hormonal imbalance!!!\n\nThe TYPE Of Fat Matters\n\nWhat MATTERS is WHERE you get your fats.\n\nDon\u2019t go fry up some bacon and think this is healthy. Most animal and dairy fats are the problem.\n\nHeating oils, processed vegetable fats, hydrogenated and trans fats are the problem.\n\nInstead, have HEALTHY fats. Have free-range, pastured-raised eggs WITH the yolk. Have 2-3 of these 3-4x weekly.\n\nIdeally, you\u2019d eat eggs RAW \u2014 but if you can\u2019t do that (most can\u2019t), at least keep the yolk runny and soft, which will increase your \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol.2\n\nIf you want to have some free-range, grass-fed meat or bison/buffalo 2-3x a week, that\u2019s fine too.\n\nGrass-fed red meat has higher levels of CLA fats, which boost testosterone, reduce cortisol, are anti-inflammatory, and help reduce many health problems.\n\nOther than that, I would stay away from most other meats because they\u2019re processed and full of negative hormones such as ESTROGEN, which will LOWER your testosterone and libido.\n\nLastly, you can also add in a non-animal source of HEALTHY saturated fats such as raw, extra virgin coconut oil. Maybe just 1 tablespoon daily.\n\nNot only does raw coconut oil improve your testosterone and fat-burning hormones, it also helps increase blood flow and circulation \u2014 both of which are important for your sex drive and erections.3\n\nThe primary cause of low libido and erection problems is an imbalance in your hormones. You want to increase your \u201cpro-sexual\u201d hormones such as testosterone and decrease your \u201canti-sexual\u201d hormones such as estrogen, prolactin and cortisol. Eat more healthy cholesterol from free-range, pasture-raised eggs, including the yolks. Have some healthy saturated fats from raw, coconut oil\n\nThe primary cause of low libido and erection problems is an imbalance in your hormones.\n\nYou want to increase your \u201cpro-sexual\u201d hormones such as testosterone and decrease your \u201canti-sexual\u201d hormones such as estrogen, prolactin and cortisol.\n\nEat more healthy cholesterol from free-range, pasture-raised eggs, including the yolks.\n\nHave some healthy saturated fats from raw, coconut oil\n\nYes, there are other diet and lifestyle improvements you can make to help increase your sex drive.\n\nIf you want faster results, that\u2019s easier and more convenient than food, you can also take specific \u201cpro-sexual\u201d herbs and vitamins.\n\nPlease don\u2019t lose hope. You CAN fix and improve your testosterone, libido and erections!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/body-cholesterol.shtml\n\nhttp://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/03/10/the-sunny-side-of-eggs.aspx\n\nJournal of the American College of Cardiology, 2006; 48(4): 715-720, \u201cConsumption of Saturated Fat Impairs the Anti-Inflammatory Properties of High-Density Lipoproteins and Endothelial Function\u201d\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC201014/",

    "content": "Have you ever had a problem getting an erection when it was time to have sex?\n\nDo you feel insecure about it?\n\nDo you worry about it or get anxious, which makes it even harder to get an erection?\n\nHas it caused you NOT to want to have sex or get into a relationship?\n\nDo you consider yourself a \u201cnice guy\u201d?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then keep reading because you\u2019re not alone.\n\nI\u2019ll talk about one of the HIDDEN causes of erectile problems that most people don\u2019t talk about and guys wouldn\u2019t admit to.\n\nBut, more on that in a minute.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the 3 types of erections:\n\nreflexive (associated with physical stimulation)\n\npsychogenic (from visual or mental images)\n\nand nocturnal (occurs during sleep)\n\nMost of you know and have seen \u201cmorning wood\u201d when you wake up with an erection. And if you don\u2019t, it could be a sign of low testosterone and/or poor blood flow.\n\nGranted, you get these \u201cnocturnal\u201d erections in the middle of the night when you\u2019re sleeping and you aren\u2019t aware of them, unlike the morning one when you see it.\n\nThe next obvious cause of an erection is physical touch. Again, if you aren\u2019t able to get or maintain an erection with physical touch, this is primarily due to hormonal imbalance, such as low testosterone and secondarily, poor blood flow.\n\nBut, what if you can\u2019t get an erection when trying to have sex, but you have no problem getting erections when masturbating?\n\nThis form of erectile dysfunction is more related to psychological reasons and thus, psychological impotence.\n\nThis would include stress, anxiety, depression, guilt, low self-esteem, and relationship issues.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to focus on today \u2013 your mind, which is super powerful at causing erections and having orgasms.\n\nAnd before I start, know that optimizing testosterone and other sex hormones will definitely improve psychological causes of impotence, in addition to the physical causes.\n\nI\u2019ll share with you the best testosterone-optimizing tactics.\n\nBut, let me first start with a personal story\u2026\n\nAnxiety & Sexual Performance\n\nMany men who have psychological erectile problems do so because of anxiety and worry.\n\nYou are overthinking the situation and can\u2019t stay in the moment.\n\nThis is even worse these days when people have more ADHD and overly stimulated brains and have become dopamine-resistant.\n\nYou start to think about all sorts of stupid things:\n\nAm I doing this correctly\n\nPast performance issues\n\nHer sexual history \u2013 less history, more mystery\n\nIf you\u2019re under stress because of work or money or something else, you might start thinking about that stuff and again, your mind goes somewhere else.\n\nYou start feeling insecure for a variety of reasons:\n\nAre you going to last long enough?\n\nAnd the more you think about this stuff, the worse things get. You start to obsess over it.\n\nLike the person who has insomnia and the more they think about it, the more awake they become.\n\nAnd the reason your penis stops working is because your mind sends out stress signals, releasing stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol.\n\nThese are \u201cfight or flight\u201d hormones, not relax and have sex hormones.\n\nThese are survival hormones, not let\u2019s make a baby hormone.\n\nThese hormones send more blood to your muscles so you can run and get away and less to the penis to have sex.\n\nIn fact, this is why taking stimulants such as Adderall, ephedrine, many ADHD drugs, cocaine, and yes \u2013 even caffeine, causes erectile problems.\n\nThese \u201cuppers\u201d cause your penis to shrink inward. Like a scared turtle. Or when your penis is in cold water.\n\nIronically, the increase in dopamine with such stimulants may increase your DESIRE to have sex, but they can prevent your ability to get an erection.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the solution?\u2026\n\nI\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\nPercentage Of Men Affected By Psychological Impotence\n\nBut first\u2026, if any of this makes sense to you or you have felt such situations, just know that you are NOT alone.\n\nStudies show that 25% or more of men are affected by this. The number might be higher since men are too embarrassed to admit to it.\n\nAlso, younger men who have fewer sexual experiences, tend to have more psychological erectile problems.\n\nWhile older men over the age of 40, tend to have more physical erectile problems due to hormonal imbalances and aging.\n\nHow Do You Know If It\u2019s Psychological Or Physical Impotence?\n\nPhysical causes of erectile dysfunction are typically due to:\n\nHormonal imbalances, such as low testosterone and/or high estrogen levels.\n\nPoor blood flow is another reason, which is linked to diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, obesity, and so forth.\n\nMany drugs can also cause it \u2013 such as those for prostate, hair loss, blood pressure, cholesterol, sleep, anxiety and depression.\n\nThen there are street drugs such as alcohol, marijuana, uppers, downers and so forth.\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of factors that can cause physical erectile problems.\n\nHowever, how do you know if something is linked to psychological reasons?\n\nCan you say \u201cyes\u201d to the following:\n\nDo you get morning erections?\n\nCan you get erections when you masturbate?\n\nAre you under extra stress \u2013 work, relationships, money, etc.?\n\nAre you dealing with extra anxiety or feeling sad or depressed?\n\nDo you get nervous about pleasing your partner?\n\nDo you feel insecure when it comes to having sex or sexual performance?\n\nIf you say yes to one and certainly more than one of these situations, then you might also be dealing with psychological issues causing your erectile problems.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with stress and/or anxiety about something, sex is probably the last thing on your mind.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been feeling down or hopeless or lost or somewhat depressed for a while, you don\u2019t want to have sex.\n\nAnd this can also be linked to hormonal and neurological imbalances, such as dopamine and serotonin.\n\nThese days, we have overstimulated dopamine, and thus, the receptors are somewhat \u201csaturated\u201d and less responsive.\n\nSo, you feel \u201cblah\u201d and unmotivated and not driven.\n\nThat lack of dopamine sensitivity causes a lack of drive and thus, you don\u2019t want to pursue sex.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a relationship and things aren\u2019t going well\u2026 you\u2019re arguing a lot\u2026 you feel like you\u2019re not \u201cgood enough\u201d\u2026 you feel depleted\u2026 criticized\u2026 and so forth, all of this is a turn-off.\n\nYou probably have some resentment or anger.\n\nWorst of all, you might just be completely apathetic, and thus, you don\u2019t care.\n\nAgain, no need or desire to perform sexually.\n\nPorn Dependency / Addiction\n\nPorn has become a big problem these days for guys.\n\nIf you\u2019re watching porn all the time and that\u2019s the way your brain and body gets an erection\u2026 You might get anxiety or \u201cstage fright\u201d when it comes to an actual human sexual performance.\n\nWhen you watch porn, you\u2019re in control. You pick and choose what you want to watch, you can fast-forward, skip and so forth.\n\nYou watch only what you want and when you want.\n\nThis is NOT how reality is and thus, you get anxiety and can\u2019t perform.\n\nOr your sense of reality is fake since you\u2019re mainly watching fake porn.\n\nThe other problem is porn can make a guy feel insecure since most porn actors have above-average penis size. They seem to get hard in seconds, stay erect as long as they want, and then orgasm on command.\n\nYou then start to compare yourself to such people and that\u2019s a really bad idea.\n\nThese guys are the best of the best.\n\nYou don\u2019t compare yourself to Michael Jordan when you play basketball or Einstein when you\u2019re learning something\u2026. Right? \u2026 You know better. You know it\u2019s not realistic.\n\nYET, if all you do is watch big dicked porn guys, you start to feel very insecure about yourself.\n\nThis causes performance anxiety.\n\nI have an entire course on how to grow your penis if you\u2019re interested. It\u2019s free and the link is below in the description area.\n\nLots of people, due to their upbringing, culture, or religion feel guilt around sex. Many times it\u2019s subconscious and you don\u2019t even realize it.\n\nSo, feeling guilty about the topic of sex can cause psychological erectile problems.\n\nLastly, having low self-esteem for a variety of reasons is a big underlying cause of psychological erectile problems.\n\nMaybe you feel like you\u2019re not good enough, big enough, rich enough, good-looking, smart, and so forth.\n\nOr you lack sexual experience.\n\nAll of these things cause you to overanalyze the situation, and not be in the moment and then stress hormones go up, blood flow decreases, penis shrinks and now you start to panic and become compulsive about and from that point onward, things only get worse!\n\nOkay, so now you know all the potential causes and reasons for having psychological erectile problems.\n\nBut, what\u2019s the solution?\n\nWell, it depends on YOUR specific situation. It depends on what factor or factors that are causing the psychological problems specifically for YOU!\n\nLet\u2019s talk about some of the different scenarios you might be dealing with.\n\nAnd before I start, remember \u2013 if you optimize your hormones and increase your testosterone levels, your psychology and mindset ALSO improve.\n\nONE important thing I\u2019ve realized is that many psychological issues in men are linked to being a \u201cnice guy\u201d.\n\nYes, this is something I had to deal with personally for many years. In fact, most of my 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s.\n\nI almost hate myself for it and have so much regret. And I don\u2019t want this to happen to YOU.\n\nI know a lot of guys don\u2019t feel good about the size of their penis. Especially when you watch a lot of porn.\n\nThen you hear women saying how they like big dicks or that a guy has to be at least 6 or 7 inches or more.\n\nI have so many of these stories myself that maybe I\u2019ll share them with you in a later video or probably on a private membership site for us guys.\n\nBut the first thing is, that women don\u2019t know how to measure. They\u2019re so lame. So, forget what they say.\n\nAs far as porn, as I said earlier, these guys a doing porn BECAUSE they have large dicks. So, stop comparing yourself to them. It\u2019s totally unrealistic.\n\nAgain, I made a detailed guide about improving your penis size and hardness.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with stress, whatever it is, if there\u2019s something you can do about it, great \u2013 then do it.\n\nIf you can\u2019t, then stop focusing on it.\n\n95% of your time should be spent on SOLUTIONS, not problems.\n\nMost unsuccessful people do the opposite, they focus the majority of their time and energy on the problem.\n\nIf you\u2019re not happy in your current relationship, first see what YOU can do to make improvements. What are YOU doing that\u2019s hurting your relationship? Maybe get therapy.\n\nSpeak to your partner about whatever the issue is and if they don\u2019t respond favorably, then move on.\n\nDon\u2019t blame, just share.\n\nIF they criticize and don\u2019t empathize, forget about it.\n\nLife is too short to be in a miserable relationship.\n\nIf you watch a lot of porn, reduce it.

    "content": "Today, we will discuss how stress, or scientifically, cortisol hormone, can affect testosterone levels, libido, and muscle mass, and even cause weight gain.\n\nAs a side note: stress hormones such as cortisol accelerate aging and are linked to numerous health problems (blood sugar, blood pressure, poor sleep, depression, etc.)\n\nCortisol vs. Testosterone: The Battle Within\n\nWhen you experience stress, your body releases the stress hormone cortisol, which can negatively affect your testosterone levels.\n\nDespite what you might think, cortisol, not estrogen, is the real enemy of testosterone.\n\nHigh levels of cortisol, can cause your body to go into survival mode, which can suppress processes such as muscle building and libido.\n\nStress & Its Effects on Your Body\n\nStress is not only a feeling of tension, but it also has physical and mental effects that can disrupt hormone balance and overall health.\n\nInterestingly, men generally handle stress better than women because the higher testosterone levels help offset the negative effects of cortisol.\n\nHowever, this can change with age, lifestyle, and continuous exposure to stress.\n\nSteroids, Muscle, and Cortisol\n\nExploring the world of steroids gives us insight into how testosterone and cortisol interact.\n\nSteroids, essentially synthetic testosterone, help counteract cortisol\u2019s muscle-wasting effects, allowing for more extended, more intense workouts and better muscle preservation.\n\nManaging Cortisol Hormone for Better Health\n\nI\u2019ve personally experienced the negative impacts of high cortisol, which led me to create a product called Stress & Cortisol Relief.\n\nIt helped me manage my stress levels and improve my overall health, including better sleep and more balanced hormone levels.\n\nTips for Lowering Stress Hormone\n\nTo manage cortisol and stress, consider your lifestyle choices.\n\nProper sleep, exercise moderation, and managing emotional and physical stressors are crucial.\n\nIn fact, deep quality sleep makes a big improvement in stress levels. Ironically, as cortisol levels go up, melatonin \u2013 the sleep hormone \u2013 goes DOWN.\n\nSo, stress causes sleep issues, which cause even high cortisol levels.\n\nNatural supplements can help, especially if natural methods aren\u2019t enough to lower your stress.\n\nI often take Stress & Cortisol Relief, especially in the evenings, to help reduce cortisol levels and promote better sleep.\n\nManaging stress and cortisol can indirectly boost your testosterone and improve various health aspects, from mood to sexual performance.\n\nIt is crucial to manage stress and cortisol levels to maintain healthy testosterone levels and overall well-being.\n\nSimply taking supplements won\u2019t be enough; it\u2019s important to lead a balanced lifestyle that promotes long-term health.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling with stress, try natural and supplemental methods to keep cortisol in check and testosterone balanced.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with stress!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve \"healthy stress hormone levels\" with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

I would suggest watching the above video for the full details.\n\nThis information is for any guy who is dealing with erectile problems or wants better/improved erections \u2026 And you happen to have high cholesterol or a family history of cholesterol problems.\n\nOr, heart disease, heart attacks or strokes \u2013 like I do with my family.\n\nSo, let me simplify things for you and give you options to quickly and naturally help improve both your cholesterol and erections.\n\nCholesterol is needed to make sex hormones \u2013 including testosterone \u2013 which controls your sex drive, libido, and erections.\n\nSo, you do NOT want low cholesterol levels either.\n\nAnd this is a major issue with cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as \u201cstatins\u201d\u2026 They tend to lower cholesterol levels too much, which then causes testosterone, libido, and erection problems directly.\n\nAs well, indirectly these drugs have a lot of negative side effects\u2026 such as\n\nand yes, lower libido and erectile problems.\n\nI always suggest using drugs as a LAST resort, AFTER you\u2019ve done everything natural. And, if you do end up using drugs, do so at a lower dosage.\n\nBut Not Too High Cholesterol\n\nNow, the next problem is having high cholesterol \u2013 it can lead to fatty deposits in your arteries, which can decrease blood flow and circulation throughout the body \u2013 including in the penis.\n\nThis obviously can lead to erectile problems.\n\nPeople with high cholesterol also tend to have lower testosterone levels and hormonal imbalances.\n\nAgain, this leads to lowered libido and erectile problems.\n\nSO \u2013 low and high cholesterol isn\u2019t good. You want healthy cholesterol levels in a youthful range.\n\nHealthy Cholesterol Levels Is The Solution\n\nThe good news is that you can have healthy cholesterol and lipid levels using natural vitamins and herbs.\n\nA primary cause of higher cholesterol and lipid imbalance is not diet or exercise, but the negative changes in your hormones as we get older.\n\nThis is why young people eat junk food, don\u2019t sleep well, and hardly have cholesterol problems.\n\nAnd the older we get, the worse cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure \u2013 all these health problems are age and hormonal-related.\n\nThis is why taking natural herbs and essential vitamins and minerals that work specifically WITH your body to help support healthy cholesterol levels can help your libido and erectile problems as well.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/morning-wood-erections-is-a-major-warning-sign-of/",
    "content": "I get a lot of questions about morning erections or morning wood as some guys call it.\n\nMedically it\u2019s called \u201cnocturnal penile tumescense\u201d or NPT for short.\n\nSo today you\u2019ll discover:\n\nWhat Causes Morning Erections\n\nWhat Does Morning Wood Mean \u2013 Good & Bad\n\nWarnings About Morning Wood\n\nCauses of NOT Getting Morning Erections\n\nHow To Increase Morning Wood & Improve Your Erections\n\nWhat Causes Morning Erections?\n\nThere are a variety of reasons you would get morning wood. Here are the top 5 most probable ones.\n\nParasympathetic Nervous System:\n\nThis part of your nervous system takes control while you sleep, especially during REM sleep, the stage where you dream. This can trigger erections.\n\nREM sleep typically happens near the morning hours, which is why you may also get the morning wood.\n\nYour testosterone levels are highest in the morning, right after waking up from REM sleep. This hormone spike can cause an erection, even without physical stimulation.\n\nThis also explains why when you\u2019re younger, you\u2019d get random erections, sometimes at embarrassing places \u2013 maybe in the pool swimming or somewhere else that isn\u2019t appropriate.\n\nA massive spike in testosterone, which happens in the morning, can cause this non-stimulatory erection.\n\nA full bladder might press on a nerve that triggers your parasympathetic system, leading to an erection.\n\nThis also makes sense when you think about it since the morning is when most guys, have to urinate the most.\n\nDuring the day, your body releases hormones to suppress erections. These are mainly norepinephrine and epinephrine (also known as adrenaline).\n\nThese hormones are part of the sympathetic nervous system, which is active when you are awake and alert.\n\nRemember, this is the opposite of the parasympathetic system I mentioned earlier that can cause erections while sleeping.\n\nAdrenalin work to constrict blood vessels, making them smaller, less blood flow, and so forth \u2026 including those in the penis, making it less likely for an erection to occur.\n\nThis also happens when you get nervous before sex. Your adrenalin shoots up, stress hormones such as cortisol increase, your body gets tense and the blood goes AWAY from the penis.\n\nAnyway, the point is at night, especially during REM sleep, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system decreases, and the parasympathetic nervous system takes over. This shift allows for relaxation of the blood vessels and an increase in blood flow to the penis, which can lead to nocturnal erections.\n\nPhysical Stimulation:\n\nEven if you\u2019re asleep, your body can still respond to touch and thus, an erection can happen. If your genitals are touched, it may cause an erection.\n\nIf your genitals rub against something \u2013 such as the mattress or sheets or whatever\u2026 That slight stimulation, coupled with everything else I\u2019ve mentioned, can cause an erection while you\u2019re sleeping.\n\nWhat Does Morning Wood Mean?\n\nMorning wood is a normal and healthy part of sleep. It means that the penile tissue, blood, and nervous system are in good condition, working properly, and are healthy.\n\nNow, I mention MORNING erections since that\u2019s the one most guys will notice when they wake up.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only time you get erections while sleeping.\n\nAs stated earlier, Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT), also known as sleep-related erections, usually occurs 3\u20135 times during an 8-hour sleep period.\n\nThese erections can last more than 30 minutes and sometimes up to 2 hours.\n\nNPT is more common in younger men because they have higher testosterone levels, and can occur every morning and multiple times during the night.\n\nAs men age into their 40s and 50s, they may experience fewer NPT episodes due to a decline in testosterone.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that these NPT erections contribute to penile health.\n\nIn some way, the penis is like a muscle \u2013 the more often it pumps up and the bigger the pump, the healthier the muscle and in this case, the penis.\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d.\n\nThis is why pumping and penis exercises can also help improve erections.\n\nLack Of Morning Wood = Serious Health Problems?\n\nSadly, the less often you get these erections, the less healthy you are.\n\nIn fact, the research shows that the lack of erections, more specifically, the morning wood and NPT, is a warning sign of potential heart problems.\n\nThis means poor blood flow to the heart AND brain.\n\nThis could be plaque buildup.\n\nOr high blood pressure or blood sugar levels.\n\nIt is also an indicator of low testosterone and poor hormonal balance.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll get to solutions about this in a minute.\n\nWarnings About Morning Wood\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned today, morning wood and NPT is necessary and important for your health, including penis health.\n\nSo, what if you\u2019re NOT getting these morning erections? Like you used to? Not as often? Or worse yet, AT ALL?\n\nMaybe it happens once a week or a month?\n\nWell, as stated, this is really bad warning sign that something is wrong.\n\nBut, what\u2019s the cause of this?\n\nWhat\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d in your body?\n\nAnd more importantly, how can we fix it?\n\nCauses Of NOT Getting Morning Erections\n\nNot getting morning erections, also known as a reduction in or absence of nocturnal erections, can be a sign of various underlying health problems. Here are the top 7:\n\n1. Erectile Dysfunction (ED):\n\nVascular Issues: Conditions like atherosclerosis (narrowing of blood vessels) can reduce blood flow to the penis.\n\nNeurological Problems: Damage to the nerves that control erections, due to conditions like diabetes or spinal cord injuries.\n\n2. Hormonal Imbalances:\n\nLow Testosterone Levels: Testosterone plays a key role in sexual function. Low levels, often due to aging, hypogonadism, hormonal imbalances, or lack of specific nutrients.\n\nIncreased \u201cFemale\u201d Hormones: Elevated levels of prolactin and estrogen, will reduce testosterone and reduce the refractory period and your ability to get erections.\n\nIncreases in Stress Hormones: Earlier I mentioned how an increase in adrenaline will reduce blood flow. As this stress hormone increases, so will cortisol, which will then decrease testosterone levels.\n\n3. Psychological Factors:\n\nStress and Anxiety: Chronic stress or anxiety can affect your sexual function, including morning erections.\n\nDepression: Depression can lower libido and affect the frequency of nocturnal erections.\n\nAntidepressants: Some medications, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can interfere with sexual function and reduce the occurrence of morning erections. These are popular drugs such as Prozac.\n\nBlood Pressure Medications: Certain antihypertensives can also impact erectile function.\n\nHair Loss & Prostate Medications: Drugs used for hair loss and prostate growth, such as 5-alpha reductase inhibitors like Finasteride (Proscar & Propecia) will your ability to get and maintain erections.\n\nSleep Medications: Many drugs, including those that are over the counter that are used for sleep, will reduce your erections.\n\nActually, there are a lot of drugs that cause erectile problems.\n\n5. Lifestyle Factors:\n\nPoor Sleep Quality: Sleep disorders like sleep apnea or chronic sleep deprivation can interfere with REM sleep, where morning erections are most likely to occur. Poor sleep also causes numerous hormonal imbalances, such as a decrease in testosterone levels, while increasing cortisol levels.\n\nExcessive Alcohol Consumption: Alcohol can impair sexual function, and chronic use can lead to a decrease in morning erections.\n\nSmoking: Smoking can damage blood vessels and restrict blood flow, reducing the likelihood of morning erections.\n\nNatural Aging: As men age, the frequency and intensity of morning erections may decrease due to changes in blood flow, nerve function, and hormone levels.\n\n7. Underlying Medical Conditions:\n\nDiabetes: High blood sugar levels can damage nerves and blood vessels, leading to a reduction in morning erections.\n\nCardiovascular Disease: Conditions affecting heart and blood vessel health can impact the ability to have morning erections.\n\nObesity: Excess weight can contribute to hormonal imbalances and vascular issues, both of which can reduce morning erections.\n\nHow To Increase Morning Wood & Improve Erections\n\nNow we are near the end of today\u2019s topic, and the part most of you care about is how to increase morning wood and improve the quality of your erections.\n\nFirst, you need to stop doing all the negative things that I mentioned, such as:\n\nChanging your medications for alternatives that don\u2019t cause these problems.\n\nLowering your stress levels\n\nLimiting or eliminating alcohol, smoking, marijuana, and other \u201cstreet\u201d drugs.\n\nFinally, you need to increase your testosterone levels.\n\nPersonally, when I take certain herbs that increase testosterone, the first week I notice I\u2019m getting a ton of erections every time I get up to pee in the middle of the night or when I wake up in the morning.\n\nThese are crazy rock-hard, won\u2019t go away kind.\n\nIt\u2019s awesome and makes me feel super young again.\n\nBut, after a week or two, my body adapts and the erections aren\u2019t as awesome.\n\nHowever, they are still way better than before I took the supplements to boost my testosterone levels.\n\nThe other thing you need to do is improve your blood flow.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ve made videos about this, in addition to supplements you can take that\u2019ll quickly help increase circulation throughout your body \u2013 heart, brain, muscles, and yes, your penis.\n\nTake action, and fix this situation because as stated in the very beginning \u2013 lack of morning wood and poor erection quality a major warning sign of poor health \u2013 for your heart and brain.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from Patrick and he asks\n\n\u201cWhat causes erectile problems and impotence? Why haven\u2019t scientists found one permanent cure for this?\u201d\n\nThis is a good question and yeah, you\u2019d think there would be a cure for this by now \u2026 just like hair loss or other health issues. But what causes arousal in people, men and especially women\u2026 is very complicated and thus, there is never going to be ONE solution because there usually isn\u2019t ONE cause.\n\nHOWEVER, over the past 20+ years, I\u2019ve seen a common denominator and primary cause \u2026 and that has to do with hormonal imbalances.\n\nAs men age, their testosterone begins to decline\u2026 starting as early as in his mid 20\u2019s. By age 40, you barely make half of what you used to in your 20\u2019s, and obviously, it only gets worse as you get older.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to know is that testosterone is the PRIMARY hormone that controls sex drive, libido and erections\u2026 BOTH physically and emotionally! And this is because testosterone interacts with OTHER key \u201csex\u201d hormones such as:\n\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT)\n\nDopamine and other neurotransmitters in your brain\n\nIs It All In Your \u201cHead\u201d?\u2026\n\nHowever, there are other factors that ALSO contribute to low libido and erection problems. One of them is your MIND! If you\u2019re under stress \u2014 either physical or emotional, that\u2019ll cause problems.\n\nAnd what\u2019s interesting is that \u201cstress\u201d causes a DECREASE in your testosterone levels and an increase in your \u201cstress\u201d hormone, cortisol. Again, a HORMONAL issue.\n\nAnother cause is if you\u2019re overweight and eat a lot of junk foods, smoke (marijuana or cigarettes), and drink alcohol. And the reason for this is because FAT cells produce more estrogen, as does smoking pot and drinking alcohol.\n\nAs estrogen increases, testosterone DROPS! Again, a HORMONAL issue.\n\nPrescription Drugs & Erectile Problems\u2026\n\nAnother major cause is if you take prescription medications \u2014 for cholesterol, blood pressure, stomach acid, blood thinners, prostate, etc., etc.\n\nALL of these drugs cause lowered libido and impotency because, yes\u2026 you guessed it \u2014 HORMONAL changes.\n\nEven drugs such as Viagra and Cialis don\u2019t work very well IF your testosterone is too low. In fact, they work MUCH better if your testosterone and hormone levels are optimal.\n\nDon\u2019t Worry, You\u2019re Not Alone\u2026\n\nMy background is in anti-aging and Endocrinology, which is the study of hormones. So I\u2019m extremely familiar with this topic and very passionate about it because I want to look and feel young, just like everyone else. And hormonal balance is the secret!\n\nI\u2019ve helped hundreds and thousands of men over the past 20 years fix this area of their life, naturally and permanently\u2026 simply by optimizing their \u201cyouth\u201d hormones.\n\nSo, don\u2019t worry\u2026 You\u2019re not alone, there\u2019s hope and natural solutions.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "I wasn\u2019t planning on making this video in 2025, but I had an interesting experience recently that I think is worth sharing.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d things that ended up teaching me some surprising lessons, especially on a topic I know many of you are curious about penis size, performance, and body image. So let\u2019s dive into it.\n\nThe Accidental Nude Beach Experience\n\nA few weeks ago, I went paragliding in San Diego\u2014great views, and lots of fun, but I ended up feeling a bit seasick while soaring through the sky.\n\nAfter landing, my friend suggested we take a walk, and, by chance, we stumbled upon a nude beach.\n\nNow, let me tell you, this wasn\u2019t exactly on the itinerary! But, curiosity got the better of us, so we decided to check it out.\n\nAs soon as we got there, all sorts of thoughts started racing through my head.\n\nYou know, as guys, we tend to size ourselves up, comparing ourselves to others\u2014especially when it comes to things like penis size.\n\nThis is a topic I get tons of questions about, and I\u2019ve even created an entire free email course on increasing penis size, and girth and achieving harder, fuller erections.\n\nThe Reality of Penis Size\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: most of us, whether we admit it or not, have at some point worried about our penis size.\n\nAnd unfortunately, a lot of that stress comes from comparing ourselves to unrealistic standards, especially those set by porn. What I saw at the beach was eye-opening.\n\nIn reality, most men are \u201cnormal\u201d size or even smaller than you might expect. And guess what?\n\nNo one there was in perfect shape.\n\nIt\u2019s like comparing yourself to Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime or a top-level bodybuilder like Chris Bumstead\u2014most of us will never look like that, no matter how hard we train.\n\nThe same goes for penis size in porn. Porn stars are handpicked for their genetics, just like athletes, and comparing yourself to them is setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nSome Interesting Observations\n\nOne of the more unexpected things I noticed was the difference in body proportions.\n\nSome guys with smaller penises had noticeably large testicles, which sparked a little theory in my mind.\n\nI wondered if maybe their testosterone levels weren\u2019t optimal, and their testicles were compensating by producing more testosterone.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a \u201cDr. Sam theory,\u201d but it made me think about how the body balances hormones. There\u2019s no scientific proof behind this, but it\u2019s interesting to consider how testosterone, size, and performance might be interconnected.\n\nAnother thing that stood out was how many of the guys weren\u2019t \u201cshowers,\u201d meaning they didn\u2019t appear very large when flaccid.\n\nSome might be \u201cgrowers,\u201d where their size increases significantly when erect, while others might just have small penises, period.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key takeaway: nobody cared.\n\nThe idea that you need to have a giant penis to feel confident or attractive is a myth. You don\u2019t need to be a porn star to feel good about yourself.\n\nTips for Feeling Confident (Manscaping and More)\n\nSomething else I noticed at the beach was how many guys had lots of pubic hair, which can actually make your penis look smaller.\n\nA simple tip I always recommend is manscaping\u2014trimming that hair can make a big difference in how large you appear.\n\nIt\u2019s a quick and easy way to boost your confidence, and I have a video on that too.\n\nWhy Some Guys Seemed Bigger\n\nThere were two guys at the beach who were notably larger than the others, and I noticed something interesting\u2014they kept pulling on their penises.\n\nThis reminded me of a technique I talked about in my email course called jelqing, which involves stretching and massaging the penis to potentially increase size over time.\n\nIt\u2019s not a quick fix, but it\u2019s a method some people swear by. Seeing these guys consistently \u201cpulling\u201d made me wonder if they were using similar techniques to enhance their size.\n\nMy Personal Nude Beach Experience\n\nNow, I didn\u2019t plan to get naked at the beach, but, well\u2026nature called!\n\nI needed to use the bathroom badly, and there were no facilities nearby.\n\nMy date suggested I go into the ocean, and after a moment of hesitation, I stripped down and dove in.\n\nIt was my first time going fully nude in public, and while it was a bit nerve-wracking at first, I realized something important\u2014nobody cared.\n\nThere was no judgment, no weird looks.\n\nIt was a liberating experience and a reminder that most of the insecurities we hold onto are just in our heads.\n\nConclusion: Confidence Over Comparison\n\nThe biggest takeaway from my accidental nude beach trip is this: stop comparing yourself to unrealistic standards.\n\nWhether it\u2019s porn, professional athletes, or celebrities, these comparisons are harmful and unnecessary.\n\nIn reality, most people are just like you\u2014average and normal.\n\nThe key is to feel confident in your own skin and focus on what you can improve for yourself, not based on others.\n\nFor those of you still curious about improving your penis size, performance, or overall confidence, I\u2019ve got links to my free email course, which covers techniques like jelqing, increasing girth, and more.\n\nBut remember, confidence comes from within, not from how you measure up to others.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today, I\u2019m going to share an exercise that can help fix erectile dysfunction (ED), give you stronger, harder erections, and even improve your prostate health.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with premature ejaculation or weak orgasms, this will help with that too.\n\nIt\u2019s one simple exercise, and you don\u2019t need a gym, equipment, or a personal trainer. In fact, you can do it right now while watching this video.\n\nSounds great, right? Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nWhat Are Kegel Exercises?\n\nKegels are exercises most people associate with women after giving birth. However, men can benefit from these too.\n\nThey\u2019re designed to strengthen your perineal muscles, which sit between your anus and testicles.\n\nThis area plays a crucial role in erections, ejaculation, and prostate function.\n\nStrengthening it can give you more control over your erections, help you last longer, and even make your orgasms more intense.\n\nHow Do Kegels Work for Erections?\n\nDoing Kegel exercises correctly engages the perineal muscle, which you use without even realizing it.\n\nFor example, when you\u2019re midstream while peeing and you stop the flow, you\u2019re using that muscle.\n\nOr when you\u2019re holding in gas because you\u2019re on a date and don\u2019t want to embarrass yourself, that\u2019s the same muscle at work.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014just like with any other muscle, you need to exercise it consistently and correctly to get the full benefits.\n\nDoing it wrong can lead to weaker erections or even ED. So, let me show you how to do it right.\n\nStep-by-Step: How to Perform Kegel Exercises\n\nFind the Muscle: Imagine stopping your pee mid-flow or holding in gas\u2014this is the muscle you\u2019ll focus on.\n\nContract: Squeeze the muscle and hold for 3-5 seconds.\n\nRelease: Relax the muscle for 1-2 seconds.\n\nRepetitions: Repeat this process for 10-20 reps. That\u2019s one set.\n\nStart with one set, three times a week, like Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\n\nOver time, increase to two or three sets. As you build strength, you can even do Kegels five times a week.\n\nBut don\u2019t overdo it\u2014just like lifting weights, your muscles need rest to grow stronger.\n\nWhy Kegels Are Important for Erections\n\nYou might be wondering, \u201cWhy should I care about these exercises?\u201d\n\nStrong pelvic muscles mean better control over your erections.\n\nThink of it like this: if you want bigger biceps, you do curls, right? The same logic applies to your perineal muscles.\n\nStronger muscles down there mean better blood flow, harder erections, and more control during sex.\n\nPlus, Kegels also help with incontinence and overactive bladder issues, which is a nice bonus.\n\nSupercharge Your Erections with Hormonal Balance\n\nNow, doing these exercises is fantastic, but there\u2019s one more thing that\u2019ll make a massive difference\u2014your hormones.\n\nTestosterone is the key to improving your sexual performance, muscle growth, and overall vitality, especially if you\u2019re over 30.\n\nLower testosterone levels can lead to weaker erections, reduced libido, and even fatigue.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you covered. To maximize your Kegel exercise results, you need to optimize your hormone levels.\n\nHow? By increasing testosterone and balancing hormones like estrogen and cortisol.\n\nIt\u2019s like adding fuel to the fire. You\u2019re already doing the work, so let\u2019s make sure you get the best possible outcome.\n\nBoost Your Testosterone Naturally\n\nThere are natural ways to increase testosterone levels, and it\u2019s easier than you think.\n\nI\u2019ve got a ton of videos on how to boost testosterone through supplements, vitamins, and lifestyle changes.\n\nSimple tweaks like improving your diet, reducing stress, and adding specific supplements can supercharge your progress.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wait months to see results\u2014you can start seeing improvements in just a few weeks, sometimes even days.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line, guys.\n\nJust like going to the gym, Kegel exercises require consistency, patience, and progressive overload.\n\nYou can\u2019t do them for a week and expect to be a superstar in bed. Stick with it. Do your sets three to five times a week, keep up with the reps, and be patient.\n\nYou\u2019ll start to notice stronger erections, more control, and better sexual health within a few weeks.\n\nAnd remember, you don\u2019t need any equipment. You can do these while you\u2019re sitting at your desk, driving, or even watching TV.\n\nSo no excuses\u2014get started now and take control of your sexual health.\n\nI always say this: don\u2019t just passively watch videos or read articles\u2014take action.\n\nCheck my other videos on boosting testosterone, grab the supplements I recommend, and start your Kegels today.\n\nThe best part? You can see results in a few days to a couple of weeks if you stay consistent. Combine the exercises with a solid hormonal foundation, and you\u2019ll see massive improvements.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Take action, do the exercises, and let me know how it goes.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Now it\u2019s 2025 and up to now, I\u2019ve written a lot of articles about how to increase your testosterone levels, so you can look and feel younger. So you can have a higher libido, fix erectile problems, gain more muscle, lose fat, and have higher energy levels.\n\nHowever, today I want to write an article about one of the major causes that lower testosterone in the first place and that\u2019s stress and worry\n\nStress = Low Testosterone\n\nAs a reminder, optimal testosterone levels have both physical AND psychological/emotional benefits.\n\nIn fact, one of the best \u201canti-depressants\u201d in this world, is having higher testosterone levels.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a lot of new evidence showing how testosterone and anxious feelings interact with each other1,2\u2026 Specifically, they work in opposing ways.\n\nInterestingly, this also affects women in the same way.3\n\nIt\u2019s All About Your Hormones\n\nTo simplify everything and get right to the point,\u2026 when you are feeling anxious or have a panic attack\u2026 or you\u2019re worrying a lot,\u2026 a lot of negative changes happen to your body \u2013 many having to do with your hormones, various chemicals, and neurotransmitters.\n\nWhen your stress hormone cortisol goes up, your testosterone levels drop.4\n\nThis is because nature thinks you must be dealing with a lot of problems and this is NOT the time for you to procreate and have a baby. So, it shuts down your testosterone levels.\n\nAs your testosterone drops, your estrogen RATIO becomes more dominant. Thus, estrogen starts to take over\u2026 This further causes you more stress and \u201cmoodiness\u201d.4,5\n\nWith worry and stress, your neurotransmitter Dopamine drops! \u2026This causes a drop in your libido and will also cause an increase in your female hormone, prolactin. Which FURTHER drops your testosterone levels.6-8\n\nAlso, worry and stress, cause more adrenal production and that lowers another neurotransmitter called serotonin.9,10 Which causes depressive feelings and panic attacks, which just makes this entire process much worse.\n\nAnd finally, stress and worry cause sleep problems and we all know how important sleep is for testosterone products, growth hormone release, and just overall health.\n\nAnd all of these negative changes accelerate aging!\n\nSo what\u2019s the point?\u2026 You need to BETTER manage your \u201cstate\u201d of mind. Your THOUGHTS. Your BODY.\n\nThe Secret Is HOW You React\n\nNow, you can\u2019t always manage or eliminate stress. That\u2019s just crazy and impossible.\n\nHowever, you can and MUST manage how you REACT to stressful situations.\n\nYour MIND is extremely powerful and what you focus on, expands. What you think about more, you\u2019ll FEEL more.\n\nSo, don\u2019t watch it just yet. \u2026 Because I want you to do yourself a big favor\u2026\n\nOne of the biggest reasons people have CHRONIC stress and worry is that they mistakenly spend the majority of their time focusing on the PROBLEM\u2026 the \u201cstressful\u201d situation.\n\nWhat You Focus On Expands\n\nWhat you focus on expands and gets bigger. So if you\u2019re spending time always focusing on the problem and having \u201cnegative dialog\u201d in your head \u2013 your body is constantly going to feel stressed and anxious.\n\nInstead, you need to spend your time on the SOLUTION!\n\nI\u2019m not saying pretend nothing bad has happened. Just don\u2019t dwell on it. It\u2019s not going to fix anything, right?\n\nMost people make problems worse than they really are.\n\nI\u2019m telling you to just see it as it really is \u2013 a temporary setback, which is a part of life.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that children freak out over the smallest things. The toy breaks and they think it\u2019s the end of the world. They don\u2019t know any better. They don\u2019t know that they can just fix the toy or get a new one.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s really important is that children let things go quickly. While we adults don\u2019t!\n\nSo as an adult, you have no reason to freak out when something bad happens because you know that \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d and you\u2019ve dealt with problems in the past and you always got through it, right?\n\nHowever, like a child, you need to learn to let go and move \u201conward and upward\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s all a state of mind.\n\nThen, do something physical because \u201cmotion, creates emotion\u201d and that will improve your hormones.\n\nTake Herbs, Vitamins & Minerals\n\nAnd finally, you can take special herbs, vitamins, and minerals during times of stress and worry, which will almost immediately rebalance your hormones back to optimal levels.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/8/764.short\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X02918386\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399911003060\n\nDalley J.W. and Everitt B.J.

    "content": "Video Summary About Stress & Libido\n\nStress can come in all shapes and sizes. Physical and emotional stress is basically the same for the body.\n\nYour hormones react in the same negative action. Basically, as your stress hormones go up \u2013 such as adrenaline and cortisol\u2026 then your testosterone comes down.\n\nAnd if you think about it LOGICALLY, it makes sense.\n\nNature doesn\u2019t want you to have sex and procreate when you\u2019re under stress.\n\nYour body thinks there\u2019s a lack\u2026 lack of food, shelter, abundance, and so forth.\n\nSo, this is a very bad time to have a baby, and thus, let\u2019s DECREASE your hormones that can stimulate sex drive \u2013 such as testosterone.\n\nNOTE: This is for both men and women!\n\nIt\u2019s SURVIVAL Time \u2013 Testosterone Drops!\n\nAs you probably already know, testosterone is the primary hormone that controls your libido, sex drive and for men \u2013 erections.\n\nFor women, the desire and libido come down as testosterone drops. They also have \u201cvaginal dryness\u201d and thus, sex becomes uncomfortable.\n\nUnfortunately these days, in modern times, we are under constant stress.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m not here to tell you that you need to avoid stress \u2013 this can\u2019t be done.\n\nHowever, I am telling you that you need to better MANAGE your stress. You need to learn how to lower your stress hormones, such as cortisol.\n\nHow To Manage Stress & Lower Cortisol\n\nNow, one of the best ways to lower stress and cortisol levels is to get deep, quality sleep.\n\nIronically, as stress hormones such as cortisol go up, the sleep hormone melatonin goes down and you have a much harder time sleeping\u2026 Especially that deep, restful REM sleep.\n\nYou have a harder time falling asleep and staying asleep.\n\nSo, again, learn to manage your stress so you can decrease elevated cortisol levels and other stress hormones.\n\nOf course, I have done videos specifically about this subject \u2013 discover simple ways of instantly improving your stress hormones.\n\nWhich will of course boost your testosterone and sex drive, but will also promote better health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort...

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/refractory-period-more-orgasism-better-sex/",
    "content": "Before I continue, I want to let you know that the refractory period, hence the time or phase following your next orgasm, is totally normal and natural.\n\nHowever, how LONG this \u201crefractory period\u201d lasts depends on a variety of factors, which is what I\u2019m going to discuss, including solutions to improve and shorten the duration of the refractory period.\n\nCauses Of Long Refractory Period\n\nLet\u2019s first discuss the 3 biggest causes of the poor and long refractory periods.\n\nI know your time is valuable, so let\u2019s start with the first and primary reason, which would be hormonal changes.\n\nBefore you have sex, you\u2019re in a more \u201cdriven\u201d mode.\n\nYour goal is to have sex and hopefully have an orgasm.\n\nThis is fueled by dopamine, a neurotransmitter, and by one other super hormone, which I\u2019ll tell you about in a minute.\n\nDopamine is referred to by some people as the \u201cpleasure\u201d chemical. Others will refer to it as the \u201cpursuit\u201d chemical.\n\nSo it makes sense dopamine is high because you are now in the pursuit of sex and the pleasure of having an orgasm.\n\nDopamine is associated with sexual arousal.\n\nNow, after you have an orgasm, things change.\n\nDopamine drops dramatically, while another hormone called prolactin shoots up.\n\nIn fact, dopamine and prolactin typically work in opposite spectrums. As one goes up, the other comes down.\n\nThus, prolactin induces a feeling of sexual satisfaction and REDUCES arousal.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that both men and women\u2026 and pretty much all mammals\u2026 produce the same hormones. The main difference is ratio and amount.\n\nFor example, both men and women have testosterone and estrogen. However, men have a lot more testosterone than estrogen comparatively.\n\nAnd prolactin is typically more of a female hormone. It goes up dramatically when women are breastfeeding. It\u2019s required to produce milk.\n\nIn regards to men, high prolactin can also cause milk to come out of your nipples. This happens to some bodybuilders when taking certain drugs such as nandrolone.\n\nAnd, if prolactin and estrogen are both higher in men, you get gynecomastia, also called \u201cman boobs\u201d.\n\nOne other negative effect of high prolactin is hair loss, which most doctors and so-called hair experts will not tell you because they don\u2019t know.\n\nIn fact, this is seen in birds that are molting, which is the shedding of old feathers. And, this is triggered due to a high surge in prolactin.\n\nOne last thing, as prolactin and estrogen go up, testosterone typically will come down.\n\nI mention all of this because if you think about it, it makes sense.\n\nWhat happens as men get older?\u2026\n\nThe refractory period increases and it takes them longer to get an erection and have orgasms\n\nTheir dopamine AND testosterone levels drop.\n\nEstrogen typically rises, at least in ratio to testosterone.\n\nThey lose their hair.\n\nThey get fatty chests or man boobs or even gynecomastia in extreme cases.\n\nAren\u2019t as horny and have a harder time getting erections.\n\nAren\u2019t as driven in life\u2026 this, of course, includes sexual.\n\nAnyway, I can go on and on\u2026 But, you get the point.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the solution?\n\nWe want to increase dopamine and the superhormone I alluded to earlier, which is testosterone.\n\nYes, higher testosterone means more dopamine, which means higher libido, more drive, better erections, and yes, typically lower prolactin.\n\nAnd how do we do this?\u2026\n\nI\u2019ll talk about that in a minute because I also need to mention other causes of poor refectory period.\n\nAfter your orgasm, your body\u2019s nervous system shifts from a state of arousal to a more relaxed state. This will obviously reduce your body\u2019s response to sexual stimulation.\n\nOf course, higher testosterone will allow you to bounce back and recover faster.\n\nWe also can\u2019t forget about your psychological and emotional state of mind. Stress, fatigue, and a lack of interest can extend the refractory period.\n\nRemember how stimulated you get when you\u2019re with someone new? That\u2019s associated with higher testosterone and dopamine levels.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, you get used to the same stimuli and thus, the same person or the same sexual act or the same type of porn will NO longer shoot up your dopamine levels\u2026 And hence, less excitement and sexual arousal.\n\nAs with everything, we always have to factor in genetics, age, and physical health. Some people genetically have a longer refractory period.\n\nAging, hormonal imbalances, and poor physical health will all contribute to a longer refractory period.\n\nNow that we know the causes, let\u2019s talk about the solutions for improving and shortening the refractory period.\n\nRemember how earlier I said that the longer refractory period is caused by an increase in Prolactin? And how as prolactin goes up, dopamine levels come down?\n\nWell, the opposite is true as well.\n\nThus, we want to increase your dopamine levels. We can do this naturally or with drugs.\n\nFor example, Parkinson\u2019s drugs typically increase dopamine levels or increase your body\u2019s receptor sensitivity to dopamine.\n\nWhy? \u2026 because people with Parkinson\u2019s are lacking dopamine levels, among other neurological problems that go beyond the scope of today\u2019s topic.\n\nSo, for almost 20 years, I\u2019ve been taking a drug called Selegiline (suh-leg-juh-leen), also called Eldepryl or Deprenyl.\n\nI\u2019m not going about this drug today. However, if you want me to in future videos, please let me know.\n\nThere are other drugs that increase dopamine or are dopamine agonists. Such as bromocriptine or cabergoline. But, Selegiline is the safest in my opinion and has many anti-aging and cognitive benefits.\n\nHowever, legal disclaimer \u2013 don\u2019t listen to anything I say, always speak to your doctor before you do anything.\n\nBut, let\u2019s first start with natural ways of improving dopamine levels.\n\nOne of the best is taking L-tyrosine \u2013 an amino acid. I take 500 mg, 2-3x daily. But, start with just 500 mg on an empty stomach in the morning.\n\nIt does give you energy, so don\u2019t take it at night.\n\nAlso, taking Mucuna Pruriens Extract can help. Make suure it contain 25% L-Dopa extract. I take 200 mg daily.\n\nThis is found in AlphaViril, the testosterone-boosting, libido-enhancing, and erection-improving supplement I\u2019ve been taking for over 20 years.\n\nWhich leads to the next topic and that is:\n\nAs stated already, increasing testosterone levels will help boost dopamine levels. And of course, so many other benefits associated with naturally high testosterone.\n\nOf course, I\u2019ve written so many articles about how to naturally increase testosterone and optimize your hormones, that I\u2019m not going to do that in today\u2019s article.\n\nAnd yes, AlphaViril has numerous natural herbs and vitamins that help boost your testosterone levels.\n\nThis is why AlphaViril has been a best seller for over 20 years and my favorite supplement. Because it deals with the primary hormonal factors, that I\u2019ve discussed today \u2013 testosterone estrogen, prolactin, dopamine, and others.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Is your penis a shower or a grower?\n\nAnd the other question is, can you change it since most people would like to be a shower as it makes a good first impression before you have sex or if you\u2019re just walking around the locker room naked or whatever.\n\nAnd regardless of where you are, we all want a penis that performs better \u2013 and thus, you\u2019re able to get harder, fuller and bigger erections.\n\nRegardless of whether you\u2019re a grower or a shower.\n\nI\u2019ll get into all of this in more detail today which you\u2019ll discover how to:\n\nBecome more of a SHOWER than a grower\n\nWalk around with a bigger, fuller flaccid penis \u2013 so you\u2019ll make a more impressive first impression and feel more confident.\n\nOver time, you can even grow your penis \u2013 in both length and girth\n\nYou\u2019ll also discover how to increase your libido and sex drive and help fix erectile problems.\n\nMy Personal Experience\n\nSimply stated, if you\u2019re a grower and hence, your flaccid, un-erect penis is much smaller, it makes you feel insecure. Less manly. Especially if it\u2019s the first time you lady has seen it.\n\nSo, let\u2019s see if we can fix that in today\u2019s video so you become a shower AND you\u2019ll get harder, fuller, and bigger erections.\n\nAs far as myself, I guess I\u2019m a shower.\n\nBefore this video, I did a quick measurement and I was almost 5 inches, 4.8 to be exact. That\u2019s almost 12.5 cm for you the non-US people.\n\nThis is flaccid. Not hard or erect.\n\nHowever, if I think back to my younger days in my teenage and 20\u2019s, I don\u2019t think I was a shower. I think I was more of a GROWER.\n\nIn fact, I remember in the 9th grade when I was 14 years old. I was in the shower after a basketball game.\n\nI was always a little shy about showering in front of other guys. Anyway, I do remember that this one guy kept pulling and tugging at his penis, to stretch it out\u2026 I guess to make it look bigger or longer around the other guys.\n\nI thought it was odd.\n\nNow, thinking back, I guess he wanted to feel more secure. I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\nAs far as myself \u2013 I\u2019m sure all the changes I\u2019ve made over the years, with the supplements I\u2019ve taken, the hormone optimizations I\u2019ve made, and the penis exercises I\u2019ve done\u2026 I\u2019ve slowly turned into a SHOWER.\n\nI\u2019ve also put on more sizes down there as well \u2013 length and girth.\n\nWhat Defines A Penis Shower vs A Grower\n\nWell, if we use research, a 2018 study involving 274 males found that age played a role in whether participants were a growers or a showers.\n\nI\u2019ll talk about the age difference in a minute\u2026\n\nThe researchers defined a grower as having a flaccid to erect penile length increase of 4 centimeters (about 1.5 inches) or more, while an increase of less than 4 cm indicated that a person was a shower.\n\nSo to summarize \u2013 if your flaccid penis grew 4 cm/1.5 in or more, you\u2019re a GROWER.\n\nBut if the penis grew less than 4 cm/1.5 in to get erect, you\u2019re a SHOWER.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how they come up with the specific 4 cm cut off. But, that\u2019s what the criteria was for this study.\n\nWell, based on this research, I\u2019m a grower because I also grow more than 4 cm or 1.5 inches.\n\nThis was confusing for me because I guess I\u2019m a shower that\u2019s also a grower? I\u2019m not sure\u2026\n\nRegardless of what this study states, I think most guys want to be a SHOWER.\n\nYou don\u2019t want a turtle dick that\u2019s hiding.\n\nNow, in that same study of 274 participants, 26% were growers, while 74% were showers.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re smaller and a grower, you\u2019re not alone \u2013 about 25% of people are. Especially younger people.\n\nWhat Determines Whether You\u2019re Penis Is A Shower or a Grower?\n\nThe erectile tissue of the penis comprises\n\nAll of these allow the penis to become erect.\n\nHowever, with age, the penis can lose tissue elasticity, which may affect how it stretches.\n\nThus, based on this 2018 study, as you age, you become more of a SHOWER, rather than a grower.\n\nYour penis is just hanging longer due to gravity, because of less collagen and elastic fibers and so forth.\n\nHowever, aging also SHRINKS the penis.\n\nLower testosterone, higher estrogen/cortisol ratios to testosterone, lower growth factors such as growth hormone, and poor blood flow, slowly decrease the size of the penis \u2013 in both length and girth.\n\nIf that\u2019s not bad enough, not only does the penis shrink as you age, but you also don\u2019t get as hard of an erection and that further makes the penis look and feel smaller.\n\nOther Factors For Shrinkage\n\nAging and lowered hormone levels cause shrinkage. However, there are other factors, such as:\n\nTemperature: As every guy knows, cold temperatures or water shrinks the penis temporarily.\n\nStress: Stress and the rise in cortisol and adrenalin cause shrinkage too. Fight-or-flight causes vasoconstriction and lowered blood flow. Not only does the penis shrink during times of stress, it\u2019s much more difficult to get an erection.\n\nHow Can You Become a SHOWER, Rather Than A GROWER?\n\nLike I said, most guys want to be bigger \u2013 whether that\u2019s being erect or even flaccid.\n\nSo, let me give you some suggestions on how to be MORE of a shower and look bigger.\n\nIf you have a fat belly and extra fat in the pubic region, your penis will look smaller.\n\nI remember years ago I consulted a guy who did penis enlargement exercises. He grew his penis from 6.5 inches to almost 10 inches.\n\nThis took him almost 4 years. He was obsessed with it and would do the penis exercises daily, sometimes up to 2-3 hours a day.\n\nI give you more details about how he did this in my free Penis Enlargement Email Course.\n\nHe said how much more confident he was, how his wife liked it more, etc.\n\nHowever, he told me that because he was so overweight and had a big belly, his 10-inch penis didn\u2019t look that big and wasn\u2019t as impressive.\n\nEventually, he stopped doing the penis exercises, his penis did shrink back down to 9 inches.\n\nHowever, he got serious about his health and also lost 40 lbs of fat and he said that with the lower body fat, his 9-inch penis looked bigger than when it was 10 inches.\n\nAdditionally, being fat increases estrogen levels and decreases testosterone, which will indirectly shrink the penis muscle over time.\n\nJust like body fat, a big pushy pubic hair is going to hide the penis. Trim the pubic hair really short or even buzz it.\n\nNot only will the penis automatically look bigger. It\u2019ll look cleaner, well-kept, and more aesthetic and pleasing to your partner.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the 70\u2019s, so do some manscaping\u2026\n\nIncrease Testosterone\n\nResearch has shown that as your testosterone levels drop as you age, the penis does shrink.\n\nAnd, as you get older, estrogen levels do the opposite and they increase as do stress hormones.\n\nThis combination shrinks the penis, decreases your sex drive, and causes erectile problems.\n\nSo not only should your goal be to increase and maximize your testosterone levels. However, you ALSO want to lower elevated estrogen levels and stress hormones.\n\nI\u2019ve made a ton of videos about increasing your testosterone and optimizing your hormones.\n\nI do have a free email course about this as well.\n\nPlus, you can take a supplement called AlphaViril \u2013 which I\u2019ve been taking for almost 25 years. It does all of the testosterone boosting and hormone optimizing, naturally.\n\nLastly, doing penis exercises, especially when combined with higher testosterone levels, will increase the length and girth of your penis.\n\nDoing them daily will also cause your penis to hang longer and fuller, most of the day, and thus, you become a SHOWER, instead of a grower.\n\nThis is all similar to working out at the gym. Exercise + high testosterone levels = bigger muscles.\n\nIt\u2019s the combination of the two. Without the testosterone, you\u2019ll have girl muscle sizes.\n\nAdditionally, by doing these exercises, you\u2019ll increase blood flow to the penis, so it\u2019ll look more \u201cpumped\u201d and fuller, most of the day.\n\nSimilar to working out at the gym and your biceps look bigger for a couple of hours after you leave the gym.\n\nAdd in a supplement such as Blood Flow Optimizer to maximize the circulation to the penis, and now you have a winning formula.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the hormones and blood flow when it comes to the penis and muscle growth.\n\nGenetics, hormones, and age are important factors between penis growers vs showers.\n\nAs you age, due to gravity and lower elastin, your penis will tend to hang more and appear to be more of a shower.\n\nHowever, aging and the drop in testosterone levels, coupled with the rise in estrogen levels and stress hormones, can cause the penis to shrink.\n\nThe 4 best ways to give the elusion that you are a SHOWER and over time become a shower are\n\nIncrease your testosterone levels, while lower excess estrogen and stress hormones\n\nIncrease blood flow to the penis.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to you to actually TAKE ACTION.\n\nDon\u2019t be the majority who just watches and does nothing. You\u2019ll never achieve any goals doing that.\n\nBe the successful 5% that takes action on this valuable information.\n\nYou\u2019ll be happier, more confident, and healthier too \u2013 in and out of the bedroom.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m going to talk about masturbation and whether it\u2019s good or bad for your testosterone levels and sex drive.\n\nThus, is \u201cNoFap\u201d abstience better? Or should you just go ahead and masturbate as much as you want?\n\nI\u2019ll discuss UCLA research regarding suicidal thoughts and masturbation.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ll talk about prostate health and how abstinence affects it.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll cover sperm quality & ejaculatory volume \u2013 does abstinence improve it or make no difference?\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll reveal one of the easiest and fastest ways to increase testosterone levels, sex drive, and improve prostate, sperm quality, and ejaculatory volume\u2026 naturally \u2013 not having anything to do with your masturbation or abstinence.\n\nMasturbation & Abstinence\n\nNow, I bring this topic up because I get lots of private messages from guys about masturbation\u2026\n\nThey ask me everything about it:\n\nMy penis is shrinking\n\nShould I stop and \u201cNoFap\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019ve done a bunch of videos about the topic of masturbation, including multiple QA videos.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one question that keeps getting asked and that\u2019s about the myth that not masturbating or abstinence, will increase testosterone levels.\n\nThousands of guys are holding back, including even sex with women \u2013 thinking their testosterone levels will shoot up, by not shooting out.\n\nI guess in \u201ctheory\u201d, this might be true since you feel hornier when you hold back.\n\nSome guys are also not ejaculating for weeks or even months for betterr fertility and ejaculatory volume.\n\nWell, let\u2019s get to some clinical studies\u2026\n\nSimply stated, there\u2019s basically no real research showing that abstinence \u2013 thus, not having sex or masturbating \u2013 will increase testosterone levels.\n\nIn fact, the opposite is true.\n\nWatching porn or engaging in sexual activities\u2026 and thus, anything that turns you on, can raise testosterone levels.\n\nAdditionally, there are studies showing that in older men and women, the more often you masturbate, the higher your testosterone levels.\n\nAlso, there are studies with men who have erectile dysfunction showing that low sexual activity is associated with low testosterone while resuming sexual activities restores testosterone levels.\n\nQuestionable Clinical Studies\n\nThe NoFap community will cite the occasional study that shows higher levels of testosterone when you don\u2019t masturbate.\n\nUnfortunately, the sample size is either really small\u2026 or the increase in testosterone is tiny \u2026 or the study couldn\u2019t be replicated.\n\nSome will report better mental health with abstinence.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, many people will report better stress levels, happiness, and so forth with masturbation.\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated in previous videos, if you want a natural and proven way to boost your testosterone levels, increase your sex drive, and get harder erections \u2013 then give your body the specific nutrients it needs to have your testicles produce more testosterone.\n\nThere are specific herbs and minerals that have clinical research showing all of this can be done.\n\nAbstinence & Sperm Quality\n\nWhat about sperm quality from abstinence?\n\nWell, a review of almost 30 studies concluded that abstinence and fertility outcomes are inconclusive.\n\nA study did show an improvement in fertility from abstinence, but it plateaus after 3 days. So, don\u2019t ejaculate for 3 days for a potentially better fertility outcome.\n\nNow, there are studies showing that specific herbs such as Fadogia, Tribulus and a few others help increase fertility and sperm quality because they increase LH and FSH levels.\n\nThese and similar ingredients are found in AlphaViril \u2013 the testosterone booster supplement I\u2019ve been using since 1999.\n\nMasturbation & Ejaculatory Volume\n\nAnd how about ejaculatory volume?\n\nYes, there\u2019s an increase in volume with abstinence.\n\nStudies show that every day you wait, you can increase volume by about 10%. However, this maxes out in a week.\n\nNow, please keep in mind that this extra ejaculatory volume does NOT also mean 10% more sperm every day.\n\nSo, if you want to impress someone with more volume\u2026 In porn it\u2019s called a \u201cmoney shot\u201d\u2026 I suggest you masturbate, but do NOT orgasm.\n\nDoes this every day, for about 2-3 days.\n\nThis creates an even bigger buildup in volume.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll also cum a lot faster too because you\u2019ve been holding back.\n\nSo, keep that in mind too\u2026\n\nMasturbation & Prostate Health\n\nOne last important topic and that has to do with your prostate.\n\nHaving orgasms is good for the prostate.\n\nOne reason the prostate grows as men get older is due to a lack of orgasms because guys aren\u2019t as horny or can\u2019t get erect and thus, not having sex or masturbating as often.\n\nHowever, taking certain vitamins and minerals such as Vitamin D, zinc, copper, selenium and others all help promote prostate health.\n\nAgain, these are others are also found in AlphaViril.\n\nNoFap, Abstinence & Suicide\n\nPersonally, I think abstinence and not masturbating is not natural, at least for me. We\u2019ve been doing it since puberty.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting UCLA research showing that the men who were NoFaping and hence, were celibate\u2026 When they decided to stop being abstinent, about 30% of them had suicidal thoughts.\n\nThey felt anxiety, shame, and even depression\u2026 Especially when they participated in the NoFap online communities.\n\nObviously, masturbation can affect the physical and mental health of men. Being in such groups, and the peer pressure of the need to conform or belong to a group can make things much worse emotionally.\n\nSo, let\u2019s quickly summarize what we\u2019ve learned today.\n\nAbstinence, not masturbating, not having orgasms, NoFap, and so forth don\u2019t help increase testosterone levels.\n\nFor some men, abstinence can improve their mood, maybe give them more energy, better focus on life, and so forth \u2013 all of which are important.\n\nHowever, when it comes to increasing testosterone, there are much better ways.\n\nIn fact, in numerous studies, abstinence and not masturbating causes a decrease in testosterone levels.\n\nOne of the easiest and fastest ways to boost your testosterone levels AND promote a youthful balance in your hormones is to take specific herbs, vitamins and minerals \u2013 such as those found in AlphaViril.\n\nRemember, the goal isn\u2019t ONLY to increase your testosterone levels. It\u2019s also free of testosterone. While balancing estrogen and DHT with your testosterone levels.\n\nAs for sperm quality \u2013 again, no improvement with abstinence.\n\nNow, the ejaculatory volume does increase with abstinence, but only waiting up to 3 days. After that, no further improvements.\n\nProstate health goes down with abstinence. So, make sure you try to ejaculate at least 1-2x a week for better prostate health.\n\nNow, it\u2019s up to you whether you want to be abstinent, celibate, and practicing NoFap.\n\nIt\u2019s your life and your body.\n\nHowever, when it comes to increasing testosterone levels long term, it doesn\u2019t work. Please don\u2019t fall for the false studies and myths.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Testosterone is a crucial hormone in the male body, playing a vital role in various physiological processes.\n\nLow testosterone levels, also known as hypogonadism, can have significant negative effects on men\u2019s health, potentially leading to accelerated aging, premature death, and various health problems.\n\nThis article highlights the 5 primary negative health consequences of having low testosterone.\n\nAccelerated Aging and Premature Death\n\nMen with low testosterone levels may experience faster biological aging.\n\nStudies have shown a correlation between low testosterone and increased mortality rates.\n\nLower testosterone levels can lead to decreased muscle mass, increased body fat, and reduced bone density, all contributing to aging.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism found that men with low testosterone levels had a higher mortality rate compared to those with normal levels.\n\nLow Testosterone & Cardiovascular Health\n\nLow testosterone is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n\nMen with hypogonadism have an increased risk of developing conditions such as atherosclerosis and heart attacks.\n\nClinical studies suggest that increasing testosterone levels into the normal, healthy range can improve heart health in men with low testosterone.\n\nResearch in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology showed that men with low testosterone were more likely to suffer from cardiovascular events.\n\nTRT was associated with a reduced risk of such events.\n\nMetabolic Syndrome and Diabetes\n\nLow testosterone levels are linked to metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.\n\nHypogonadal men are more likely to develop insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.\n\nTRT has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes in men with low testosterone.\n\nA study in Diabetes Care indicated that men with low testosterone levels had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.\n\nTRT improved metabolic parameters in these men.\n\nMental Health and Cognitive Function\n\nTestosterone plays a role in mood regulation and cognitive function.\n\nMen with low testosterone levels are more prone to depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline.\n\nImproving testosterone levels through TRT may enhance mood and cognitive abilities in affected men.\n\nFindings from a study in The Aging Male suggested that testosterone supplementation in men with low levels improved mood and cognitive function, reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\nLow Testosterone & Sexual Health\n\nTestosterone is essential for maintaining libido and erectile function.\n\nLow levels can lead to reduced sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and infertility.\n\nTRT can help restore sexual function and improve the quality of life for men with hypogonadism. By improving testosterone and sexual health, relationships and the bond between two people strengthen.\n\nImproving sexual health also enhances confidence, self-esteem, and happiness.\n\nResearch in the Journal of Sexual Medicine demonstrated that TRT significantly improved sexual function and libido in men with hypogonadism.\n\nLow testosterone levels can have a profound impact on men\u2019s health, leading to accelerated aging, premature death, and various health issues. Addressing hypogonadism and improving testosterone levels naturally, can help mitigate these risks and improve overall quality of life.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/immune-system/sexiest-vitamin-in-the-world/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about the sexiest vitamin in the world because it helps:\n\nBoost your testosterone levels in both men and women\n\nIncreases your desire for sex, physically & emotionally..\n\nIncreases your energy levels, so you can have sex more often.\n\nIt helps regulate excess estrogen, which can cause erectile dysfunction.\n\nImprove blood flow, so you can have better and bigger erections.\n\nIt helps produce lubrication in women.\n\nAs an added bonus, it also helps boost your immune system.\n\nUnfortunately, 90% of people, both men and women, have suboptimal levels of this vitamin. And many are actually deficient in it.\n\nI also used to be deficient in this vitamin.\n\nWhat\u2019s This Super Sex Vitamin?\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following me for a while and are subscribed to my channel, you\u2019ve heard me talk about the sexiest MINERAL of all \u2013 which is ZINC.\n\nBut, when it comes to Vitamins, D is even sexier.\n\nAnd most people don\u2019t know, but vitamin D is not technically a vitamin, it\u2019s actually a steroid hormone.\n\nIt has the same base structure of testosterone and estrogen \u2013 both being steroid molecules.\n\nThat\u2019s why Vitamin D is so powerful.\n\nMost People Are Deficient In This Vitamin\n\nOver a decade ago, I did a blood test and noticed my Vitamin D levels were low. I was honestly very surprised since I was always outdoors.\n\nI mention outdoors because sunlight is required for vitamin D production in your body. You can\u2019t get much vitamin D from food.\n\nAnd back then, I did take a multivitamin thinking that was enough, but it clearly wasn\u2019t because they only contained the bare minimum amount.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve seen hundreds of blood tests, and over and over again, I see sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D. Many times, even BELOW normal levels.\n\nAgain, I was very surprised since I live on the West Coast where it\u2019s always nice and sunny.\n\nSo, just imagine how low vitamin D levels must be in places where it\u2019s not as sunny?\u2026\n\nEspecially these days because we are indoors most of the time.\n\nAlso, the production of vitamin D drops as you age, when you have higher body fat levels and the darker your skin.\n\nThis is why we need to supplement extra Vitamin D.\n\nNot Just Normal \u2013 But Optimal Levels\n\nWhen I do a blood test, I try to keep my levels on the higher end, over 70 ng/mL.\n\nThere\u2019s no toxicity to vitamin D. But the minimum your blood test should be is 50 ng/mL\n\nRemember, the goal is not \u201cnormal\u201d levels, but OPTIMAL levels.\n\nI personally take 5000 units / 125 mcg of Vitamin D3 daily in the summer and double that in the winter, at 10,000 units/250 mcg.\n\nAgain, a blood test will give your best requirements.\n\nYou should also take Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K2 to help improve absorption into the bones where it should be, rather than the arteries where it can go if you take too much Vitamin D by itself.\n\nI take Perfect Vitamin D3 + K2 because it has the correct ratio.\n\nMost importantly, unlike other Vitamin D sources where it\u2019s in a cheaper, oil-based form derived from bodily fluids secreted by sheep\u2019s glands and wool\u2026 which is not cool.\n\nPerfect Vitamin D3 is 100% plant-based. It\u2019s micro-encapsulated for 2x improved absorbability and freshness when compared to the usual, cheaper oil-based Vitamin D on the market.\n\nThis is a very low-cost, high-value, and essential supplement for all people, especially men.\n\nA bottle of Perfect Vitamin DK lasts 3 months, which is less than 25 cents daily. Just one quarter a day dramatically improves your health, fitness & longevity\u2026 And your manhood.\n\nTry it and let me know how it works for you\u2026\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

    "content": "Hey guys, Dr. Sam Robbins here, and today I\u2019m diving deep into TRT, or Testosterone Replacement Therapy.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation floating around, so I\u2019m here to set the record straight and share my expertise on this subject.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s been in this field for quite some time, I\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to TRT. So, let\u2019s get started.\n\nWhat Is Testosterone?\n\nTestosterone is a crucial hormone that both men and women produce.\n\nMen primarily produce it in the testicles, while women produce it in smaller amounts in the ovaries and adrenal glands.\n\nTestosterone plays a key role in various bodily functions, including muscle mass, bone density, and sex drive.\n\nAs we age, testosterone levels naturally decline, which can lead to a host of symptoms.\n\nThe Misconceptions About TRT\n\nMany doctors and TRT clinics are prescribing testosterone incorrectly.\n\nThey either overdo it or underdo certain aspects, leading to numerous side effects and unnecessary costs.\n\nTRT is not a magical solution that will transform you into a superhuman overnight.\n\nThere are myths and misconceptions about its benefits that need to be addressed.\n\nWhat TRT Won\u2019t Do for You\n\nInstant Muscles: TRT alone won\u2019t give you the physique of a bodybuilder without proper diet and exercise.\n\nFix All Health Issues: It\u2019s not a cure-all for problems like poor sleep, high blood pressure, or cholesterol issues.\n\nEternal Youth: TRT can\u2019t reverse aging. It helps manage some symptoms of low testosterone but doesn\u2019t turn back the clock.\n\nThere are specific scenarios where TRT is not recommended:\n\nLack of Symptoms: If you don\u2019t have significant symptoms of low testosterone, TRT might not be necessary.\n\nFertility Concerns: TRT can affect fertility by reducing sperm production.\n\nGenetic Predispositions: Those prone to hair loss, gynecomastia, or prostate issues may find these problems exacerbated by TRT.\n\nTRT can have several side effects, especially if not managed correctly:\n\nHair Loss: Increased testosterone can accelerate hair loss in genetically predisposed individuals.\n\nProstate Issues: There\u2019s a risk of prostate enlargement or cancer.\n\nMood Swings: TRT can cause emotional fluctuations, including aggression or depression.\n\nSkin Issues: Acne and oily skin can become problems.\n\nCardiovascular Risks: Blood pressure and cholesterol levels can be negatively affected.\n\nIf you decide to proceed with TRT, it\u2019s crucial to find a knowledgeable doctor and use the correct forms and dosages:\n\nInjections: The most common form. Injections are typically given weekly but can be more frequent to maintain stable levels.\n\nTopicals: Creams and gels are applied daily. They\u2019re less effective than injections and can be messy.\n\nPellets: Implanted under the skin and release testosterone over several months. They\u2019re convenient but hard to adjust.\n\nMy Personal Experience\n\nI started exploring testosterone optimization at 19, not because I needed it but out of curiosity and a desire to understand my body better.\n\nMy levels were within the normal range, but not optimal.\n\nThrough diet, supplements, and lifestyle changes, I managed to significantly increase my testosterone levels naturally.\n\nKey Supplements and Lifestyle Changes\n\nZinc: Helps balance testosterone levels.\n\nVitamin D: Essential for hormone production.\n\nHealthy Fats: Found in foods like eggs, help maintain hormone levels.\n\nRegular Exercise: Particularly resistance training.\n\nBefore considering TRT, I always recommend trying to boost your testosterone levels naturally. This includes:\n\nDiet: High in proteins and healthy fats.\n\nExercise: Regular strength training and cardio.\n\nSupplements: Zinc, vitamin D, and herbal supplements like Ashwagandha and Fenugreek.\n\nSleep: Ensuring 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n\nStress Management: Practices like meditation and yoga can help reduce stress, which negatively impacts testosterone levels.\n\nTRT can be beneficial for those who truly need it, but it\u2019s not without risks and should never be the first line of treatment.\n\nAlways consider natural methods to boost your testosterone levels first.\n\nIf you do opt for TRT, ensure you\u2019re working with a knowledgeable professional and are well-informed about the potential side effects and long-term commitments.\n\nRemember, the goal is to achieve your health goals safely, efficiently, and effectively.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult your doctor before starting any treatment.\n\nBy following this guide, you\u2019ll be better equipped to make informed decisions about TRT and testosterone health.\n\nFor more detailed insights and personal experiences, check out my other videos and articles. Stay healthy and informed!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Looking to improve your libido and sex drive?\n\nWant to tackle erectile problems and enhance blood flow to the penis and clitoris?\n\nToday I\u2019ll reveal a simple method that offers a different approach from Viagra and Cialis and is especially effective for those who don\u2019t respond well to these medications.\n\nFurthermore, I\u2019ll share my personal experience with this solution.\n\nMelanotan II Peptide & PT-141\n\nSex drive is primarily controlled by testosterone, in both men and women.\n\nViagra and Cialis are common treatments for erectile dysfunction, but they don\u2019t work for about 35-40% of men due to low testosterone.\n\nIronically, they work better in younger men because they have higher testosterone.\n\nHowever, there is another drug or solution for those that don\u2019t respond and it works in 4x the people\u2026 it\u2019s PT-141.\n\nLet me briefly explain what it is and how it was developed.\n\nMelanotan II Peptide was originally developed as a sunless tanning agent. It works by stimulating alpha-melanocyte receptors, which promote the formation of melanin in response to sun exposure.\n\nYou take about 1 mg a day and you\u2019ll get tanner. If you add in a little bit of sunlight or a tanning bed, you\u2019ll accelerate the process. It can literally make you almost black if you take enough of it. It can also darken moles.\n\nNow, one of the side effects of this drug is erections. Far more powerful than Viagra and Cialis.\n\nOf course, if you use it just for sexual reasons, you\u2019ll be super dark.\n\nPT-141 was discovered later as a derivate of Melanotan II.\n\nUnlike Melanotan II, PT-141 enhances libido without the tanning effect.\n\nIt activates melanocortin receptors in the brain, boosting dopamine and oxytocin levels, which are essential for sexual arousal and bonding.\n\nMy Personal Experience\n\nYears ago, I experimented with Melanotan II and PT-141.\n\nThe results were impressive \u2013 stronger erections and increased libido.\n\nHowever, timing and dosage are critical. PT-141 takes about 4-6 hours to kick in, unlike the quicker action of Viagra.\n\nMy first experience was intense, with effects lasting several hours.\n\nI recommend starting with a low dose to avoid side effects like nausea and prolonged erections.\n\nNasal Spray For Erections?\n\nPT-141 can be administered via injection or nasal spray. While injections offer precise dosing, nasal sprays are convenient but may degrade faster.\n\nAlways consult your doctor before trying PT-141.\n\nMaintaining optimal testosterone levels enhances PT-141\u2019s effectiveness, allowing lower doses and reducing side effects.\n\nPT-141 is a promising solution for enhancing libido and addressing erectile dysfunction, especially for those who don\u2019t respond to traditional medications.\n\nRemember, a healthy hormonal balance is key to maximizing its benefits.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

These are the best absorbed, least insulinogenic and non-inflammatory and lectin-free sources.\n\nYour FATS should come from extra virgin coconut and olive oil, macadamia, hemp and flaxseed oil. Having about 20%-25% of your diet from a mixture of these fats creates optimal hormones, and minimizes inflammation.\n\n2 \u2013 Exercise To Increase Testosterone\n\nExercise is extremely important.\n\nUnfortunately, most people do too much or the wrong forms, which causes an increase in stress hormones and lowers testosterone.\n\nYou need to lift weights \u2013 do so 3-4x weekly or every other day.\n\nKeep your workouts to less than an hour, including the warm-up.\n\nThis is because too much high-intensity exercise increases stress hormones and lowers testosterone.\n\nAs far as cardiovascular, the best is daily brisk walks for 20-30 min or you can do them on your \u201coff\u201d days. The worst is strenuous cardio such as running or similar intense activities.\n\n3 \u2013 Stress Management To Increase Testosterone\n\nMost people leave out this part of the equation.\n\nWhen stress hormones go up, testosterone levels go down and so do other youthful hormones.\n\nMake sure you improve your sleep and get what you need. Deep, restful sleep improves all of your hormones.\n\nGo to bed before 11 pm and try to take a nap or simply relax or meditate 30 min during the day.\n\nAlso, reduce negativity in your life \u2014 thoughts, friends, information that comes to you and so forth.\n\nStress is both physical and emotional.\n\n4 \u2013 Supplements To Increase Testosterone\n\nMost of us are lacking in plant extracts, herbs, vitamins and minerals.\n\nThe way foods are made and raised these days, the lack of nutrients in the soil and the extra stressful lifestyle we all live\u2026 causes deficiencies.\n\nAdd in the fact that the older you get, the worse your absorption becomes and you MUST add in supplements to your diet.\n\nAfter lots of testing, blood work, and clinical studies, I\u2019ve noticed that the most effective supplements that help boost your testosterone and optimize your \u201cyouth hormones\u201d are:\n\nTestofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract (Trigonella foenum-graecum; 50% fenusides, 50% Saponins)\n\nAvena Sativa Extract (Oat Straw 100:1)\n\nTongkat Ali Extract (Eurycoma Longifolia Jack 100:1)\n\nMaca Root (6% Extract)\n\nBulgarian Pro-Tribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract (90% Sapongenins + 40% protodioscin)\n\nStinging Nettle (95% Extract) (Urtica Dioica)\n\n\u2026 and actually a few more.\n\nThere you have it \u2013 4 clinically proven ways to increase your testosterone and optimize your youthful hormones naturally.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26839520\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21709300\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9345114\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14501599\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15889125\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7714119\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3360302\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10355847\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14988451\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1984562\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9029197\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21855365\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3360302\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2526906\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6538617\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22234399\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15204068\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10454175\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16298085\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9629234\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20537171\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21242800\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19321573\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2726624/\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154195\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20050857",

    "content": "If you\u2019ve seen my previous articles, you know that hormonal imbalances are a primary cause of erectile dysfunction and a decrease in your libido and sex drive.\n\nHowever, most people don\u2019t realize that having high blood pressure ALSO causes erectile problems.\n\nIn fact, high blood pressure also causes a decrease in libido and loss of interest in sex for women as well!\n\nThis is important to know because, in 2025, 33% of Americans over the age of 20, have high blood pressure. And 90% have hypertension by age 65.\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse, 72% of people don\u2019t even know they have high blood pressure.2\n\nSo statistically speaking, if you\u2019re watching this video \u2026 you probably do NOT have \u201coptimal\u201d blood pressure levels.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re experiencing any form of erectile dysfunction \u2026 or a decrease in your libido \u2026\n\nOr you simply want to improve your \u201cperformance\u201d in the bedroom, it\u2019s extremely important that you support healthy blood pressure.\n\nHypertension & Physical Causes\n\nBlood vessel damage from high blood pressure (HBP or hypertension) reduces blood flow throughout your body.\n\nLower blood flow to the pelvis can negatively affect the sex lives of both men and women.\n\nMen \u2013 High Blood Pressure and Erectile Dysfunction\n\nIn a man, the effects of high blood pressure on sexual function are more physically apparent than they are in women. Erectile dysfunction happens when there\u2019s not enough blood flow to the penis to allow for an erection.\n\nBasically, a common cause of erectile dysfunction (impotence) is damage to the lining of the arteries to the penis. Because of this, there\u2019s less blood getting to the penis and thus, you end up having a \u201climp dick\u201d.\n\nBlood pressure can damage your arteries by causing them to become thicker, or even to burst. This can restrict blood flow to your penis, which can cause impotence.\n\nWomen \u2013 High Blood Pressure, Loss of libido & Interest\n\nWomen with high blood pressure may have lower libido and less interest in sex, especially if the condition is contributing to fatigue.\n\nIf a woman\u2019s blood flow to her vagina is reduced, it may also affect how her body responds both before and during intercourse.\n\nBlood Pressure Drugs and Impotence\n\nSo if high blood pressure wasn\u2019t bad enough for your sex life, the typical solutions are even worse!\n\nUnfortunately, most doctors will simply prescribe blood pressure drugs, which are known to cause erectile dysfunction.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s estimated that over 70% of men who take blood pressure medications, decide to get off of them because of these negative side effects.\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated in all of my videos, you do NOT need to take drugs to help fix your health challenges. Nature already has the solutions.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re a man or woman and you want to improve your sex drive, and libido and help fix any erectile problems, make sure you optimize your hormones and support healthy blood pressure.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nNwankwo T, Yoon SS, Burt V, Gu Q.

Soy also increases female hormones and decreases thyroid levels.\n\nRefined Carbs Cause negative hormonal changes\u2026 Such as a decrease in testosterone, thyroid, LH/FSH, and growth hormone\u2026 while increasing female hormones.\n\nAlcohol Alcohol screws up your hormones \u2013 both the \u201cfemale\u201d and \u201cmale\u201d hormones and adrenal hormones. Alcohol also decreases blood flow to the penis and increases angiotensin \u2014 a hormone linked to ED.\n\nProcessed Meats These meats and animals have lots of negative hormones in the body, drugs, antibiotics, and the wrong form of pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats\u2026 ALL of which leads to hormonal imbalances, poor blood flow, and erectile problems.\n\nDairy Dairy is also loaded with hormones, drugs, antibiotics, and incorrect types of inflammatory and arterial-blocking fats. All of these lead to hormonal imbalances, poor blood flow, and erectile problems.\n\nRemember, lifestyle is very important and food is a major cause of how you look and feel because food can change your hormones.\n\nTry to reduce some of the foods I mentioned today, so you can reduce the damage and harm to your body and more specifically, your penis.\n\nHowever, if you can\u2019t make the changes or you want faster results, utilize the specific vitamins to help your body naturally fix itself and improve your hormones.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416779",

    "content": "In today\u2019s article, I\u2019m going to discuss \u201cED\u201d, which stands for erectile dysfunction. I\u2019m doing this topic because I get a lot of questions about it\n\nWhat\u2019s the true definition?\n\nWhat are the best solutions?\n\nAnd the truth is, that if you\u2019re a guy reading this article, I don\u2019t want you to feel \u201calone\u201d or \u201cashamed\u201d. Trust me, this is a lot more common of a problem than most guys admit, especially in today\u2019s modern life-style of\n\nBad foods and pollutants\n\nToo much radiation from electronic devices.\n\nAll causing an imbalance in your hormones.\n\nIn fact, statistics show that 20% of men in their 20\u2019s have ED, 40% of guys in their 40\u2019s, 60% of men in their 60\u2019s and so forth.\n\nErectile Dysfunction Defined\n\nErectile dysfunction, or ED, is the \u201cinability to achieve or sustain an erection, suitable for sexual intercourse.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you have to be completely \u201cimpotent\u201d, where you can\u2019t even get hard.\n\nAnd this also includes times when you physically feel fine, you\u2019re still horney, and you can get erections,\u2026 but something is happening in your BRAIN that causes you to \u201cgo limp\u201d, either before or during intercourse.\n\nUnfortunately, your penis has a mind of its own and there\u2019s never one simple answer.\n\nThe truth is, \u201cED\u201d problems are not just experienced by \u201colder guys\u201d. Young guys deal with it as well. It\u2019s called \u201cperformance anxiety\u201d because they\u2019re thinking about it too much.\n\nThey don\u2019t have enough experience or confidence or something else \u201cemotionally\u201d is happening, which causes the penis to not work like it *should* or in private when you\u2019re masturbating and everything seems perfect!\n\nIf \u201cED\u201d problems happen once in a while, then it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s normal and it happens to all men at some point.\n\nHowever, if it happens more often than you\u2019d like, then this can be a \u201cwarning\u201d sign of health problems.\n\nWhat Causes Erectile Dysfunction?\n\nSo, there are a lot of reasons for erectile dysfunction.\n\nAs I said, your penis has a mind of its own and sometimes, it\u2019s completely disconnected from your \u201cbig brain\u201d.\n\nThere are \u201cmedical\u201d causes, such as certain drugs \u2014 prescription, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, stimulants (caffeine), etc. \u2014 This can affect any man, at any age because these drugs lower your testosterone and/or cause blood flow problems.\n\nThen \u201cphysical\u201d causes, such as poor blood flow, chronic illnesses, fatigue, wearing a condom, etc. \u2014 happen more to older guys.\n\nThere are also \u201cemotional\u201d causes, such as feeling insecure, lack of experience, worrying about stress, performance anxiety, problems with your partner, etc. \u2014 This can happen at any age. Stress is more for \u201colder\u201d guys, while anxiety is more for \u201cyounger\u201d guys.\n\nFinally, there are \u201chormonal\u201d causes, such as low testosterone, high estrogen, prolactin, progesterone, and cortisol levels \u2014 This used to be more towards \u201colder\u201d guys, but these days it\u2019s affecting younger guys as well, as early as their mid 20\u2019s.\n\nHowever, almost all the \u201ccauses\u201d \u2013 whether physical or emotional \u2013 cause a NEGATIVE change in your hormones!\n\nWhat Are The Solutions?\n\nThe solution has to be based on the PROBLEM.\n\nNow, if the problem is emotional, then this is something you need to personally examine by having an adult conversation WITH YOURSELF!\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling anxiety or low confidence or something similar, I guarantee that the person you\u2019re with is also having similar thoughts and feelings. TRUST ME, we all have insecurities and women have even more than men.\n\nPlease STOP beating yourself up about it. Focus more on the other person. Give more to them. Use your mouth, tongue, and fingers. She\u2019ll appreciate it very much and you\u2019ll give your brain a break and let more blood flow to your penis.\n\nRemember, even emotional issues such as anxiety or depression cause a NEGATIVE change in your hormones, which manifests in physical symptoms such as erectile dysfunction.\n\nStress and worry are NOT your friends and will lower your testosterone and decrease blood flow.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "If you\u2019re a man or know a man over the age of 45 and definitely older than 50, then this topic is for you.\n\nToday I want to quickly give you the top 5 warning signs and symptoms of prostate problems.\n\nAnd I\u2019m doing this topic today as Benjamin Franklin once said, \u201cAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\u201d.\n\nThus, it\u2019s much better to help you avoid and prevent a bad health problem, than to try and fix and reverse it later when it\u2019s much bigger.\n\nAnd, I\u2019m sure you can agree to this, especially the older guys.\n\nAnd if you didn\u2019t know, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death in men, slightly behind lung cancer \u2013 which can be almost avoidable for the most part, by NOT smoking.\n\nProstate problems can start in men around the age of 40, but typically around the age of 50 and older.\n\nThe longer you live, the more likely you will have prostate problems.\n\nNow, before I list the top 5 warning signs, let\u2019s first start with the top 5 risk factors.\n\nAGE: You\u2019re over the age of 50.\n\nGENETICS: You can do a DNA test to see. However, if you have a family history of prostate cancer, then you have a higher risk.\n\nRACE: Prostate cancer is higher in African-American men, while the lowest in Asian-American.\n\nBODY FAT: the higher your body fat and the bigger your waist circumference, the higher the risk. This is typically due to higher levels of estrogen.\n\nHAIR: Hair loss/balding, and excess body hair are all signs of higher DHT levels, which is linked to prostate growth, especially with elevated estrogen levels due to higher body fat and aging.\n\nOf course, lifestyle makes all of this worse \u2013 bad eating, lack of exercise, high stress levels/hormones, and so forth.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re already dealing with these risk factors, you\u2019re off to a bad start.\n\nHowever, the good news is that other than genetics, all of these risk factors are HORMONE-related and can certainly be improved, naturally.\n\nNow, there are lots of different warning signs. But, let me first discuss the top 5\u2026\n\nRemember, the goal is to be mindful so we can prevent or avoid prostate problems altogether \u2026 or at least, to spot the problem early, so it can be quickly fixed.\n\nA painful or burning sensation during urination or ejaculation\n\nFrequent urination, particularly at night\n\nDifficulty stopping or starting urination\n\nSudden erectile dysfunction, impotence\n\nBlood in urine or semen \u2014 this requires immediate attention\n\nNow, if you have all of these issues or many of them, it\u2019s time to go to your doctor and get a blood test with all of your hormones, including a PSA test.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s a good idea to also do a prostate exam, as uncomfortable as that may sound.\n\nIt\u2019s much easier to avoid or prevent than to cure or reverse.",

    "title": "What Causes Low Testosterone? | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/what-causes-low-testosterone/",
    "content": "Low testosterone is one of the worst issues that a guy can face, but even women can suffer from having too little of this hormone. It is produced naturally from DHEA and helps to drive a person\u2019s libido while helping men and women to boost muscle mass. Testosterone is even responsible for some of the hair that is on everyone\u2019s bodies right now. For guys, however, low T levels can be a lot more serious than just not feeling like having sex at the drop of a dime.\n\nEffects of Low Testosterone\n\nWith low levels of testosterone, guys can actually feel weak. Their muscles will feel like they are fatigued all of the time and there can even be cramping like you\u2019d get after a long period of exercise without enough fluids. It can mimic the symptoms of some very serious diseases like multiple sclerosis or ALS and that can cause added stress to people as well.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to be able to produce more levels of testosterone than your body can naturally produce without prescription hormone therapy, but you can max out your natural T levels with a few natural steps. This way you can make sure that you\u2019re getting the right amount of this necessary hormone so that life can really be lived to its fullest. Let\u2019s take a look at the ways low testosterone can be fixed naturally.\n\nWays to Increase Testosterone\n\nLose Weight The first step that a lot of guys need to take to fix their hormone balance is to lose weight. Even being just a couple percentage points into the overweight scale on the BMI charts can be enough to throw testosterone levels off. Once BMI levels hit 30 because of fat content on the body instead of muscle content, testosterone is even more likely to be not working as well as it should be. By losing weight, even as little as 10 pounds, many find that they begin to feel better and get a balance restored to their system.\n\nChange Your Exercise A lot of people do tons of cardio work or strength training every day to stay in shape. It\u2019s true that strong is the \u201cnew thin,\u201d but that strength comes at the price of your testosterone levels. The human body utilizes testosterone to help build the muscle mass and improve the resistance of the fibers in those muscle tissues that help provide real strength. The longer the exercise routine, the more likely that it will affect hormone levels in a negative way. Try using short, intense exercise programs that focus on high intensity efforts instead of prolong aerobics, like long jogs. The same is true with strength training. Focus on high intensity bursts using high weights and you\u2019ll boost hormone levels. It\u2019s not necessarily about speed to achieve high intensity. Slow movements with high weights can create high intensity workouts too.\n\nTake Zinc If you\u2019ve got low zinc levels, then you\u2019ve got low testosterone levels. Period. The good news is that in as little as 6 weeks, higher zinc levels will help to balance out or even maximize the T levels in the human body. When taken as a supplement to the dietary changes that you may need to make sure you\u2019re getting enough of this mineral, it can even protect against reductions of testosterone that are caused by excessive exercise.\n\nGet Sunshine You can get your Vitamin D from a number of different sources. It\u2019s even in the milk that you drink! The most effective method of getting this necessary vitamin, however, is through sunlight exposure on the skin. It is essential because it helps to develop the reproductive process within guys and naturally increases T levels when there is more of it being made. Any sunlight exposure is going to be beneficial, but try to get at least 30 minutes of consistent exposure in the morning before UV rays reach their peak so you don\u2019t have to worry so much about burning.\n\nPrevent Stress There are a number of natural stress reducers that can help to also boost testosterone levels. Stress creates a different kind of hormone within the body called Cortisol. This stress hormone actually blocks the positive effects of testosterone and can even create symptoms of low T even when testosterone production has been maximized. There are a number of herbs and vitamins that can help you naturally lower physical stress levels, while emotional stress can be handled with some basic coping mechanisms. Deep breaths, exercise, or even just yawning can all lead to lower overall Cortisol levels.\n\nReduce Sugar Any time you eat sugar, you decrease your testosterone levels. That\u2019s because insulin actually blocks the production of the hormone. Diabetics suffer from naturally lower levels of testosterone because of this very reason! The average person eats about 4 tablespoons of sugar every day. Even reducing that by 25%, or by just three teaspoons, can help to boost overall levels of testosterone in the body. Eliminating sodas, energy drinks, and other sugary items can help as well. Go with natural sugar substitutes instead instead of artificial sweeteners to maximize your efforts in this area.\n\nEat Healthy Fats Did you know that a fat free diet can be just as bad as eating too many fats? The human body even needs saturated fats in order to produce the right amount of testosterone. Most research indicates that a diet needs at least 40% of its energy from fats in foods like nuts, avocados, and even coconuts in order to produce the right amount of testosterone. Lower than that and the body just doesn\u2019t have enough to maximize hormone production.\n\nBy focusing on these specific efforts, testosterone levels can quickly be maximized and hormone levels restored to where they should be. These efforts are more effective than adding DHEA to the body because it gives you more control over the testosterone being made. DHEA can also be turned into estrogen, and for guys that\u2019s not such a good result if it happens. Take these steps, improve your hormone levels, and start feeling normal once again.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/how-to-decrease-lower-body-fat-legs-in-men-women/",
    "content": "So I\u2019ve had a few guys ask me how to decrease their lower body fat, meaning their legs. This is typically a question women ask because that\u2019s where they put a lot of their fat \u2014 on their legs and butt.\n\nWhile guys usually put it around their stomachs.\n\nAnd the good news is that there is most definitely a fix for this \u2013 for both men and women and I\u2019ll tell you how in a minute. In fact, I did this for myself.\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not liposuction, even though that is the most permanent solution. But for sure not the best because it\u2019s hard to lipo out the fat on the lower body because of all the muscles, joints, knees, ankles, and so forth.\n\nUnlike stomach fat, which is much easier for liposuction.\n\nMy Own Struggles With \u201cFat\u201d Legs\n\nWhen I was in my teens, I used to cycle and race. So, you shave your legs to prevent too much damage when you fall. Plus, because I was also into bodybuilding and so forth, I shaved my hairy legs or just trimmed them with a buzzer, so I can see how they are coming along \u2013 shape, definition, muscle growth, etc.\n\nWell, for years I had smooth legs. They weren\u2019t fat or soft like a girl. But they weren\u2019t manly either. They were just smooth.\n\nMy body fat wasn\u2019t high either.\n\nI knew plenty of guys who were fatter than me but had really lean legs with veins. It didn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s like none of their fat went to their legs.\n\nBut, not me. I didn\u2019t like it. It felt feminine. Plus with the shaved legs, it felt even more \u201cgirly\u201d.\n\nOf course, because I was so into hormones and so forth at a young age, I had my doctor do a full hormone blood panel when I was 19 or 20, even though he didn\u2019t think it was necessary.\n\nThe results were shocking.\n\nHigh DHT \u2013 the hair loss hormone\n\nHigh Estrogen \u2013 the female hormone\n\nAll were in the \u201cnormal\u201d range, but NOT optimal.\n\nI asked the doctor to help me fix it and he said, \u201cThese are in normal ranges, don\u2019t bother\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m barely 20 years old \u2013 this is as good as it\u2019s going to get\u201d\n\nHe again just ignored me and told me to go home.\n\nI Optimized My Hormones & Fixed The Problem \u2013 PERMANENTLY!\n\nSo after many months of research at the library (there was no internet back then) and testing and playing with different foods, supplements, and very low dose medications, I completely fix and optimized my hormones.\n\nOne year later I had:\n\nAll in the normal ranges, but optimal balance.\n\nAnd slowly but surely, my legs started to get leaner and leaner. They started having veins and looked manly. My body fat did improve, but balancing out my hormones, especially my estrogen levels, allowed my lower body fat to just melt off.\n\nThe Lower Body Fat Hormone\n\nSo getting right to the point, the primary hormone that causes lower body fat is estrogen, the female hormone.\n\nOf course, we all have estrogen, just that women have more of it.\n\nAnd guys with lower body fat and/or if you have \u201cman boobs\u201d (gynecomastia), you for sure have more estrogen.\n\nIn fact, these days I see more and more often, guys having too much estrogen.\n\nfat gain (all over the body)\n\ndepression and moodiness\n\nlowered testosterone (less muscle, sex drive, happiness, etc.)\n\nSo for men, fixing elevated estrogen is most beneficial and I\u2019ll show you how in a minute.\n\nWomen And Lower Body Fat\n\nWomen have lower body fat due to genetics, various receptor sensitivity issues, and of course, too much estrogen.\n\nAgain, lowering estrogen will allow you to quickly decrease lower body fat and in many ways, be healthier, leaner, and happier too.\n\nRemember, estrogen is the primary cause of cancer in women, especially in breasts.\n\nRegardless of male or female, you do not want \u201clow\u201d estrogen, just lower levels.\n\n3 Best Ways To Lower Estrogen\n\nI\u2019m going to keep this section short and to the point and if you want more details for a future article, let me know.\n\nBut here are the 3 best ways to lower estrogen, in a natural and healthy way.\n\nLose body fat \u2014 fat cells produce estrogen. More fat, more estrogen. This is also why it\u2019s harder to lose fat when you\u2019re fat. Your hormones are imbalanced.\n\nStay away from foods that have estrogenic qualities. This would be: Flaxseeds because of the lignans Soy products \u2013 beans, tofu, tempeh, etc. Wheat products Cruciferous Vegetables \u2013 cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage Dairy and hormone-treated meat\n\nSupplements that lower estrogen and prolactin, another female hormone DIM White Button Mushroom Extract Vitex Agnus B6 Curcumin Resveratrol\n\nThis is a good start.\n\nFor the ladies reading, there\u2019s more I can say, it can get a bit more complicated and if you\u2019re interested, let me know and I\u2019ll do a detailed article just for women.\n\nFor the guys reading this, using a product such as AlphaViril will quickly fix this, naturally \u2014 while also improving your testosterone and other hormones.\n\nAlphaViril is what I\u2019ve been using for 20 years and it for sure has helped me balance and optimize my hormones. This is needed if you\u2019re over 30 and especially age 40 and beyond.\n\nManaging your estrogen and having optimal hormone levels, will result in:\n\nmore muscle and strength,\n\nless body fat (abs, lower legs, man boobs, etc.)\n\nand of course, a much higher sex drive and stronger erections\n\nKeep in mind that all of this takes time. It can take a few weeks or months to slowly burn off the lower body fat.\n\nThus, the sooner you start, the sooner you\u2019ll get results.\n\nRemember, you need to lose body fat, this will help produce less estrogen from the fat cells.\n\nStay away from the foods I mentioned.\n\nAnd take specific supplements, herbs, and vitamins that will help balance out your hormones.\n\nMore details about all of these ingredients, as well as AlphaViril \u2013 the solution I\u2019ve been using for 20 years, in this special link!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "A little over 20+ years ago, both my parents had cholesterol problems and were given statin cholesterol-lowering drugs. I discuss this in another article, which I\u2019ll give you the link at the end of today\u2019s article.\n\nNow, back then I had very little knowledge about this topic. In fact, most of the research and the doctors knew very little other than \u201ccholesterol is very bad and lower it as much as you can.\u201d\n\nHowever, over the past 20 years, because of my parents and all the newest research and by NOT listening to most physicians, I\u2019ve learned that the topic of cholesterol and lipid levels is very complicated.\n\nThe good news is that I\u2019ve now been able to simplify it down to the basics.\n\nVery high cholesterol (over 260+ and for sure over 300+) isn\u2019t good for your body. It causes damage to the arteries and blood vessels. It also causes erectile problems, memory loss, and of course a heart attack or stroke.\n\nHowever, very low cholesterol (140 or lower), especially when artificially lowering it with a statin, cholesterol-lowering drugs \u2014 can be even WORSE for your health.\n\nIt\u2019s clinically linked to blood sugar problems, lowered testosterone and libido levels, memory problems, and yes, again \u2013 heart problems.\n\nThus, you want balanced, healthy levels.\n\nLastly, there are many other indicators that are even more important. Such as HDL/LDL ratios, particle size of LDL, homocysteine Levels, triglyceride levels, and liver health, where over 80% of your cholesterol is made from and NOT from the dietary cholesterol you eat.\n\nAnd of course, many other lifestyle factors \u2014 what kind of foods you eat, exercise, stress, sleep, and the biggest one \u2014 genetics and your hormones.\n\nAgain, I discuss all of this in detail, including a natural option my parents have been using for over 20 years which helps fix all of these problems with just ONE easy, convenient solution.\n\nThe link to that solution is below.\n\nIs Cholesterol Bad For Me?\n\nHowever, I bring up this topic because I get a lot of people, especially men, telling me about their problems, and many times, after digging around and asking lots of questions, I see that cholesterol is one MAJOR factor they haven\u2019t addressed or even thought about.\n\nThis is a shame because cholesterol is needed by every cell in your body.\n\nCholesterol is required to make so many of your hormones. Thus, lowering cholesterol and using cholesterol-lowering drugs are linked to so many health issues \u2013 for both men AND women.\n\nAnd doctors just blindly and stupidly prescribe them to everyone.\n\nThen, over the next few weeks, months, and years, people start to complain about so many health problems. This is great for BOTH the prescribing physician and the pharmaceutical companies because the patient keeps coming back and they get prescribed more and more drugs for\n\nBlood pressure problems\n\nAnxiety and depression\n\nALL of them, are linked to cholesterol problems and the use of these horrible drugs.\n\nRemember, genetics aside, your HORMONES control how you look and feel.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re dealing with any of these issues, especially if you\u2019re over the age of 40, then you need to stop and think about your cholesterol levels AND lipid levels.\n\nObviously, if they are really high \u2013 you need to lower them back to healthy levels.\n\nAnd please, I\u2019m begging you, do NOT use these toxic, cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. My parents both used them for almost 6 months and it aged them like 10 years and it does the same to other people.\n\nBut, they just accept it as \u201cpart of life\u201d.\n\nYou can support healthy levels naturally and live a much healthier and longer life and feel GOOD \u2013 both physically and naturally.\n\nAnd remember, your focus should NOT be just to improve your total cholesterol levels. But also to improve your:\n\nthe particle size of LDL\n\nand liver health, where over 80% of your cholesterol is made from and NOT from the dietary cholesterol you eat.\n\nAnd again, I cover all of this in a short article about my parents and also the convenient and easy solution they\u2019ve used for the past 20+ years.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and as you may know, testosterone is a good thing and \u201chigher\u201d testosterone helps you feel and look younger.\n\nYou\u2019re also much healthier because youthful testosterone levels improve cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, and many other health ailments.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve spoken about a variety of ways of naturally increasing your testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, it does you no good to increase testosterone, if you\u2019re still doing things that are KILLING and lowering your testosterone levels, right?\u2026\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss the top 10, clinically proven testosterone killers you must avoid.\n\nAnd in future articles, I\u2019ll discuss each one in more detail.\n\nPlus, at the end of today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll also reveal one of the most potent ways of naturally increasing your testosterone in minutes and more importantly, KEEPING it high so you continue to get the benefits day after day, month after month.\n\nTop 10 Things That Reduce Testosterone\n\nIncreased and chronic stress is one of the biggest testosterone killers.\n\nIn fact, don\u2019t sleep for one night and then take a testosterone blood test the next morning and I guarantee that your testosterone will easily be at least 50% lower.\n\nWhen under a lot of stress, your body releases high levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. Cortisol blocks the positive effects of testosterone.1\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that most people think that the opposite hormone to testosterone is the female hormone estrogen \u2013 but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s Cortisol.\n\nNow, you can\u2019t eliminate stress, but there are lifestyle changes and specific vitamins and herbs that you can take, that will help lower Cortisol levels and decrease your stress.\n\nDiet plays a major impact on your health, especially all of your hormones, including your testosterone.\n\nYou want to avoid packaged foods, soy, low fat, and low carbohydrate diets.\n\nYou want to reduce your sugar intake, especially high fructose corn syrup.\n\nMost of us eat enough protein, but we eat too many of the wrong kinds \u2013 such as dairy, and non-organic, non-free-range meats.\n\nYour diet should consist of at least 25% of healthy fats \u2013 including saturated fats such as egg yolks and coconut oil.\n\nAlso, forget about low or no-carb diets. Eat carbs every day, especially vegetables. Too low or high both decrease testosterone.\n\nNutritional Deficiencies\n\nEven with a \u201chealthy\u201d diet, most people are not taking enough nutrients to reach peak efficiency and increase testosterone.\n\nThe combination of poor food choices, over\u00ad-processed foods, and poor farming practices has resulted in a food system that provides sub\u00adstandard nutritional support.4\n\nThere are supplements, herbal extracts, and nutrients that help fill in the nutritional gaps in your diet \u2013 from general components of your daily vitamins and minerals \u2013 to the nutritional support of clinically proven herbs, like testosterone boosters and hormone balancers.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to boost testosterone production is with exercise.\n\nSimply put, the RIGHT form of exercise increases testosterone.2\n\nJust the same, the WRONG form kills testosterone.\n\nYou want to lift weights and build muscle \u2013 that increases testosterone.\n\nYou want to eliminate strenuous cardio sessions, like running \u2013 which lowers testosterone. Fast walking, weights and yoga all help improve your hormones.\n\nHaving too much body fat has a lot of negative consequences for your health.\n\nOne of the main problems with higher body fat is that your fat cells produce estrogen and estrogen lowers testosterone5\n\nSadly, the older we get the slower our metabolism and harder it is to lose body fat.\n\nAs your liver processes alcohol, it produces compounds that inhibit the release of testosterone.6\n\nUnfortunately, just one or two drinks result in a decrease in testosterone levels, as well as an increase in estrogen and cortisol levels.\n\nAlso, beer is the worst because the hops in beer contain more estrogen (estradiol) than almost any other plant on Earth.\n\nSo if you\u2019re going to drink, don\u2019t overdo it and stay away from beer.\n\nThe side effects of many popular medications are definitely adding to the rapid decline in testosterone levels.\n\nSome commonly prescribed medications, such as statin drugs used to lower cholesterol, are indirectly contributing to Low T.7\n\nBlood pressure, anxiety, antidepressant drugs, antacids, heartburn meds, and so many other prescription drugs all reduce testosterone.8\n\nIn addition, a lot of estrogen-\u00adbased medications used by women end up (such as birth control pills) in our water supply, which unknowingly impacts men.9\n\nIt is essential to be aware of your intake of medications and their potentially unintended impacts.\n\nSex is a natural way of keeping your endocrine system stimulated and boosting your T levels.10\n\nWith a lack of sex, your body is missing out on the opportunity for these natural surges in testosterone.\n\nIn fact, simply having an erection can quickly boost your testosterone levels.\n\nAnd yes, this also works for elderly men.\n\nOne study showed that elderly men who had more sex also had higher testosterone.\n\nFemale Hormone Mimickers\n\nFemale hormone mimickers (xenoestrogens) \u00ad\u00adare found almost everywhere: from skincare and personal care to household cleaning and outdoor products.\n\nIn addition, they are found in our food \u2013 commercially raised meats and poultry, soy products, flax seed, as well as food wraps and plastics.\n\nThese feminizing chemicals mimic estrogen, which of course limits your body\u2019s production of testosterone.\n\nIn one study, atrazine, a feminizing chemical in a commonly used weed killer, affected animals at doses as small as 0.1 parts per billion.11\n\nBe cautious around such products and choose organic meats and natural body care products.\n\nOne inescapable influence on your testosterone level is aging.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, \u201cTestosterone peaks during adolescence and early adulthood. As you get older, your testosterone level gradually declines \u2013 typically about 1-3% a year after age 25.\u201d12\n\nBy your mid-40s, your only producing 50% of what you used to.\n\nBy the time you\u2019re 60, your testosterone levels are less than 1/3 of what you had in your 20s.\n\nBy the time you hit 80, you may have only 15-20% of what you had when you were young.\n\nHowever, normal aging is only one component of the many lifestyle factors that lower testosterone. It is still in your control to boost your testosterone at any age!\n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t stop aging.\n\nHowever, you CAN make all the improvements I\u2019ve suggested today, to slow down the aging process tremendously.\n\nMy suggestion is FOR SURE to improve your diet, start exercising better and manage your stress levels (sleep better!).\n\nAnd to get faster results, with less effort, try an \u201call-in-one\u201d herbal solution that I\u2019ve been using for 25+ years.\n\nWhich is also why my private clients use as well.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://news.utexas.edu/2010/09/27/stress-hormone\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2796409\n\nhttp://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(01)45314-X/abstract\n\nhttp://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=195039\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2579652/\n\nhttp://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh25-4/282-287.htm\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01698.x/abstract\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8197251\n\nhttp://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/contaminant/contaminantOverview.do?contaminantId=-1013719332#\n\nhttp://healthcare.utah.edu/healthlibrary/related/doc.php?type=6&id=697312\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842049/\n\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/testosterone-therapy/art-20045728",

Unfortunately, most do it incorrectly.\n\nKegel exercises are done to strengthen the perineal muscles. To \u201cflex\u201d this muscle, it\u2019s very simple.\n\nOne way to describe how to do it is, by contracting your anus muscle as if you\u2019re trying to hold in gas. Go ahead and give it a try now\u2026\n\nAnother way to do it is to stop peeing midway through. Thus, as you\u2019re peeing, \u201ccontract the muscle\u201d that will STOP the pee, midway through.\n\nThat\u2019s it \u2013 that\u2019s a kegel exercise. Super simple, but extremely effective.\n\nYou can literally do it anywhere, anytime and nobody would know.\n\nYou should do kegel\u2019s about 3x a week to start with.\n\nOver time, slowly build up to 5x weekly. Just don\u2019t do it every single day because like any muscle, it requires rest to gain strength.\n\nContract the muscle (holding in gas or stop peeing) and hold for 3-5 seconds.\n\nRelax for 1-2 seconds.\n\nThat\u2019s ONE repetition\n\nDo 10 of these, for 10 repetitions.\n\nDo one set of 10 repetitions, 3x weekly. Then maybe the next week do 2 sets of 10 reps and work up to 3 sets of 10 reps, 3x weekly.\n\nYou can do it all at once, or break it up 2-3x daily. Nothing is set in stone.\n\nWhat matters is consistency, persistence, and patience.\n\nThere are lots of benefits when this muscle is strong\n\nStronger, full erections\n\nLast longer, more stamina, and the avoidance of premature ejaculation.\n\nImprovement for those who have overactive bladder or urinary incontinence.\n\nHow To Improve Results\n\nOf course, doing the right exercises is a great start.\n\nHowever, the bottom line is that you need to have optimal levels of your anti-aging, \u201cpro-sexual\u201d hormones such as total and free testosterone levels.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re over the age of 30, then I can guarantee that your \u201cyouth\u201d hormones just aren\u2019t where they used to be and are going lower and lower each year.\n\nSo make sure you take a quick look if this is a part of your life you want to improve and fix once and for all.\n\nClick here to read frequently asked questions about this topic.\n\nMore importantly, take action NOW \u2014 start doing Kegels and increase your testosterone levels before things continue to get worse.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

This includes physical and/or emotional drive.\n\nSo, don\u2019t think it\u2019s just limited to erectile dysfunction or a physical \u201curge\u201d.\n\nThe lack of emotional \u201cdesire\u201d is also a sign because your brain has lots of testosterone receptors.\n\n2 -Depression or Feeling \u201cUnmotivated\u201d\n\nLike I said, your brain has testosterone receptors also and thus, low testosterone leads to a lack of drive in life, not just sex.\n\nYou\u2019re not as motivated, and you\u2019re more irritable and \u201cgrumpy\u201d.5\n\nYou might have more anxiety or feel down or depressed at times.\n\nBasically, you feel \u201cblah\u201d and don\u2019t want to do much or socialize.\n\nI\u2019m sure you already know that testosterone plays a big role in muscle size.\n\nIf you are exercising and not gaining muscle\u2026 or you\u2019re slowly losing muscle each year, then you have low testosterone.\n\nAlso to a lesser degree, loss of strength is also an indicator of low Testosterone.3\n\nLow testosterone is also a big indicator of higher body fat, especially unhealthy belly fat and \u201clove handles\u201d.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re starting to get \u201cman boobs\u201d, then for sure you have low T and higher estrogen.\n\nHave you ever noticed that men typically require less sleep than women? Well, testosterone plays a big role here.\n\nAnd if you are tired and need naps and can barely get through the day, let alone have the energy to exercise or do much of anything else \u2013 then you probably have low testosterone.\n\nAgain, remember that the brain has many receptors for \u201csex hormones\u201d such as testosterone, cortisol, estrogen, and other female hormones.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s interesting is that your brain\u2019s memory centers are loaded with testosterone receptors.4\n\nSo if you seem to be forgetful and are worried about memory problems later in life, then you better improve your testosterone levels.\n\n7 \u2013 Accelerated Aging (hair loss, wrinkles, etc.)\n\nHave you ever noticed how some \u201colder\u201d men just look younger than someone their same age \u2014 better skin, more head hair, and so forth?\n\nThis is because testosterone is a \u201cyouth\u201d hormone and it plays a very important role in skin and hair production.\n\nMost people erroneously believe that hair loss is due to having \u201chigh\u201d testosterone \u2014 however, the opposite is true \u2014 it\u2019s from low testosterone.\n\nIF \u201chigh\u201d testosterone was the reason, then all the teenagers and guys in their 20\u2019s would be bald, but that\u2019s obviously NOT the case, right?\n\nTestosterone also improves skin collagen and elasticity, joint health, and prostate size.\n\nSo if you\u2019re starting to look older than your age, time to increase your testosterone.\n\nThere you have it \u2013 7 warning signs that you probably have low testosterone.\n\nIt\u2019s great to do a full blood test panel with all of our hormones\u2026 But, your doctor probably won\u2019t give you such a test and getting it on your own can be expensive.\n\nThe \u201cwarning signs\u201d I gave you today, is a good indicator if your testosterone levels are \u201coptimal\u201d or not.\n\nThe MOST IMPORTANT thing is how you look and feel, right?\n\nWhat you need to do is to improve your testosterone naturally, which can be done easily and effectively.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.urologyhealth.org/urologic-conditions/low-testosterone-(hypogonadism)\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/men/what-low-testosterone-can-mean-your-health#1\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5031462/\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/10/27/low-testosterone-linked-with-memory-loss.html\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770847/",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and more guys than ever, complain about having erectile problems. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be covering today \u2013 causes and best solutions.\n\nToday\u2019s question is from Rick and he asks:\n\n\u201cAre there any natural treatments for erectile dysfunction?\u201d\n\n\u2026 which is also known as \u201cED\u201d or \u201cimpotence\u201d or even \u201clow sex drive\u201d.\n\nThe good news for you is, YES!\u2026\n\nThere are a few natural remedies for erectile dysfunction that work really well and I\u2019ll reveal them to you afterward.\n\nThe bad news is that MOST of the products you hear about do NOT work and are basically a waste of your time and money.\n\nToday I\u2019ll quickly discuss natural herbal remedies and in future articles, I\u2019ll cover natural \u201cdiet\u201d and \u201cexercise\u201d solutions for improving your erections and sex drive.\n\nMost Products Don\u2019t Work!\n\nAs stated, most products do NOT work and this is because\n\nThey\u2019re using the WRONG ingredients, which have no clinical or scientific research in HUMAN studies.\n\nThey\u2019re using LOW dosages of \u201cright\u201d ingredients and thus, it\u2019s worthless. And this is done to save money.\n\nIt\u2019s a poorly designed formula that doesn\u2019t address and fix ALL the primary causes of erectile dysfunction and impotence.\n\nFor those that don\u2019t know, I\u2019m an anti-aging and endocrinology doctor\u2026 which is the study of HORMONES.\n\nAnd thus, why most people come to ME to help fix this problem because \u201cerectile dysfunction\u201d or \u201cimpotence\u201d is primarily an imbalance in your hormones, due to aging\u2026\n\nWhich can be easily \u201cfixed\u201d or greatly improved at ANY AGE, which is what you\u2019ll discover today.\n\n1. Increase Your Testosterone Levels\n\nThe first thing you want to do is increase your primary \u201csex drive\u201d hormone, which is testosterone\u2026 which declines dramatically after the age of 25.\n\nThe best, clinically researched ingredients are:\n\nTestofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract (Trigonella foenum-graecum; 50% fenusides, 50% Saponins) Avena Sativa Extract (Oat Straw 100:1) Tongkat Ali Extract (Eurycoma Longifolia Jack 100:1) Maca Root (6% Extract)\n\nTestofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract (Trigonella foenum-graecum; 50% fenusides, 50% Saponins) Avena Sativa Extract (Oat Straw 100:1) Tongkat Ali Extract (Eurycoma Longifolia Jack 100:1) Maca Root (6% Extract)\n\nTestofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract (Trigonella foenum-graecum; 50% fenusides, 50% Saponins) Avena Sativa Extract (Oat Straw 100:1) Tongkat Ali Extract (Eurycoma Longifolia Jack 100:1) Maca Root (6% Extract)\n\nTestofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract (Trigonella foenum-graecum; 50% fenusides, 50% Saponins)\n\nAvena Sativa Extract (Oat Straw 100:1)\n\nTongkat Ali Extract (Eurycoma Longifolia Jack 100:1)\n\nMaca Root (6% Extract)\n\nPlease note that these are all EXTRACTS containing the active ingredients, not \u201croot powder\u201d which is dead, worthless and cheap.\n\n2. Increase Your \u201cFree\u201d Testosterone\n\nMost of your \u201ccirculating testosterone\u201d is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). So your goal is to \u201cfree up\u201d this \u201cbounded\u201d do NOT work and this done by lowering your SHBG utilizing the following clinically researched ingredients:\n\nBulgarian Pro-Tribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract (90% Sapongenins + 40% protodioscin) Stinging Nettle (95% Extract) (Urtica Dioica)\n\nBulgarian Pro-Tribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract (90% Sapongenins + 40% protodioscin) Stinging Nettle (95% Extract) (Urtica Dioica)\n\nBulgarian Pro-Tribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract (90% Sapongenins + 40% protodioscin) Stinging Nettle (95% Extract) (Urtica Dioica)\n\nBulgarian Pro-Tribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract (90% Sapongenins + 40% protodioscin)\n\nStinging Nettle (95% Extract) (Urtica Dioica)\n\n3. Increase Nitric Oxide (NO) and Blood Flow\n\nOne of the primary ways Viagra, Cialis, and similar \u201cED\u201d drugs work, is by increasing \u201cnitric oxide (NO)\u201d levels. This causes your penis to dilate and increase blood flow, causing a harder and fuller erection.\n\nThis can be stimulated naturally by utilizing the following clinically researched ingredients:\n\nAAKG (L-Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate) Ginger Extract (Zingiber Officinale)\n\nAAKG (L-Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate) Ginger Extract (Zingiber Officinale)\n\nAAKG (L-Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate) Ginger Extract (Zingiber Officinale)\n\nAAKG (L-Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate)\n\nGinger Extract (Zingiber Officinale)\n\n4. Reduce The \u201cStress Hormone\u201d, Cortisol\n\nAs you may know, \u201cstress\u201d is a major problem for your health and even more so for your penis. This is because the \u201copposite\u201d hormone to testosterone is NOT estrogen (the female hormone), but CORTISOL \u2014 the \u201cstress\u201d hormone.\n\nOne of my favorite ingredients to use is Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium; Icarrin 20% Extract) because it\u2019s clinically proven to help reduce cortisol AND increase your total and free testosterone levels.\n\n5. Lower Your \u201cFemale\u201d Hormones \u2014 Estrogen & Prolactin\n\nAs men get older, our \u201cfemale\u201d hormones estrogen and prolactin levels go higher, which then causes your testosterone levels to go down.\n\nThis is the OPPOSITE of what you want. You can help lower estrogen by using DIM and lower prolactin using Vitex Agnus Castus (1.5% Agnusides)\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter\u2026 It helps you feel \u201chappier\u201d and more confident.\n\nThus, very important for your mindset, which obviously affects your libido.\n\nOne of my favorite ingredients that helps increase Dopamine naturally is Macuna Pruriens (25% L-Dopa)\n\nAs you can see, the human body is complicated.\n\nTaking drugs such as testosterone injections, Viagra or similar drugs addresses only ONE of the \u201csymptoms\u201d, which can cause Erectile Dysfunction \u2026 Thus, only being a temporary and short-term \u201cfix\u201d.\n\nWhat you want is an all-in-one solution that helps address ALL the primary CAUSES of impotence, so your sex drive goes up and STAYS up, naturally.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019ve spoken a few times about different foods and herbs that can help boost your testosterone levels. I\u2019ll give you links to these other articles at the end of this one.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve also gotten lots of questions asking if there are less expensive foods than the ones I\u2019ve recommended. That\u2019s why I decided to update and redo this topic in 2025\n\nThe person might be on a tight budget or in school, and can\u2019t always afford to get the grass-fed bison or pasture-raised eggs, for example\u2026 as I\u2019ve suggested in the past.\n\nLess Expensive Options\n\nKeep in mind that I\u2019ve the quality of your protein is more important than the quantity. For example, animal protein is better quality than vegetable protein.\n\nHowever, I totally get looking for less expensive options because I had the same financial struggles in my early years.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to keep it super simple and give you the 3 best and most affordable foods that are scientifically proven to increase testosterone levels.\n\nWhole eggs are great because of the Vitamin D and mainly the cholesterol found in the yolks.\n\nRemember, cholesterol is needed to produce many hormones, especially testosterone.\n\nNow, I get free-range, pasture-raised eggs. I know these are much more expensive.\n\nSo instead, just go grab any of the regular eggs. You can go to Costco and they\u2019re even cheaper there.\n\nRemember, try to keep the yolk runny when eating them. Sunnyside up for example or just eat them raw like Rocky.\n\nSalmon is probably the best seafood you can eat. It\u2019s good enough for bears, right?\n\nSalmon is high in healthy omega-3 fats and low in mercury \u2013 unlike tuna.\n\nOf course, wild-caught salmon is expensive and the farmed-raised stuff is junk.\n\nSo what I do is get wild-caught salmon, in a can.\n\nIt\u2019s easy, convenient, and costs much less than fresh or frozen. It also requires no prep time.\n\nThere is other seafood such as oysters, but they cost more or aren\u2019t nearly as healthy as salmon.\n\nAnd yes, I know \u201cin a can\u201d isn\u2019t the best, but it\u2019s fine.\n\nThere was a study done on four different types of fats \u2013 soy, olive, coconut, and grapeseed oil.\n\nCoconut oil caused the highest increase in testosterone, followed by Olive oil.\n\nI suggest you use both since they contain different types of fats.\n\nTry one tablespoon of each, daily.\n\nI suggest you eat them raw and not cook with them, if possible.\n\nNow, for these two, I advise you to get the organic versions of both, especially the extra virgin olive oil.\n\nIt costs a little more than the regular, but a bottle will last you so long that at the end of the month, you barely save a few dollars. So, don\u2019t cheap out \u2013 get organic.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that these 3 foods have one thing in common \u2013 they are high in fat.\n\nFor higher testosterone levels and optimal hormonal balance for both men and women \u2026 For building muscle, losing fat, and just overall health, fitness, and longevity \u2013 at least 20% of your diet should consist of healthy fats.\n\nAnd the 3 foods I mentioned today, deliver 3 fats your body needs \u2013 Saturated, Monounsaturated, and Omega 3\u2019s.\n\nIf you want faster \u201ctestosterone boosting results\u201d, using something easy, convenient and has a 25+ year proven track record, click here \u2013 it\u2019s what I use daily.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Improve your hormones and you\u2019ll greatly improve your life, I guarantee it!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be covering today \u2013 causes and best solutions.\n\nToday\u2019s question is from Joseph and he asks\n\n\u201cWhat are the top erectile dysfunction remedies? I need something that works quickly, it\u2019s safe for long-term use, and proven!\u201d\n\nI get a lot of questions about this topic and if you\u2019re watching this video right now, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nThe older a man gets, the worse this problem becomes and it starts as early as his mid 20\u2019s when testosterone levels begin to decline.\n\nSo it\u2019s very important for you to take action NOW, to help it from getting worse and fix it naturally.\n\nIn regards to Joseph\u2019s question, it\u2019s a little vague because there are numerous remedies.\n\nFor example, we have \u201cdrug\u201d remedies, such as:\n\nExogenous (outside) testosterone (injections, creams, etc.)\n\nPDE5 (phosphodiesterase type 5) inhibitors that increase Nitric Oxide levels (Viagra, Cialis, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, these are NOT long-term, safe solutions and should be your LAST resort\n\nThen we have \u201cdiet\u201d remedies.\n\nYou should have more cholesterol such as whole eggs, which is needed to produce testosterone.\n\nYou need to eat less protein and soy, because they tend to have high levels of estrogen, which lowers testosterone.\n\nA diet higher in fat, about 25% of your calories\u00b2 also helps increase testosterone.\n\nEliminate processed foods and sugars.\n\nDiet is important for general health if nothing else.\n\nUnfortunately, diet changes can take a long time before you see positive results and sadly, most people do NOT stick to this diet long-term.\n\nThat\u2019s why I always start guys on a proven herbal/vitamin solution that\u2019s easy and provides fast results.\n\nLifting heavy weights (6-10 repetitions). But only about 3-4x weekly because too often will do the opposite because it\u2019ll increase your stress hormone, Cortisol\n\nEliminate intense cardio such as running because it lowers testosterone and increases Cortisol\n\nJust like \u201cdiet\u201d, exercise is important for general health.\n\nUnfortunately, exercise can also take a long time before you see positive results and sadly, most people do NOT stick to a plan long-term.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s why I always start guys on a proven herbal/vitamin solution that\u2019s easy and provides fast results.\n\nHow Life-Style changes your Testosterone Levels\n\nLifestyle changes have to do more with stress management and rest.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m going to quickly discuss the 4 clinically proven ways to increase testosterone levels, naturally\u2026 from within your own body (\u201cendogenously\u201d)\n\nThis is an important topic for men, but for women as well!\u2026 Remember, both sexes have the same hormones, but only in different amounts.\n\nHealthy increases in testosterone levels are important for optimal health, bone density, positive mood, sex drive, maximum muscle and strength, and also health problem prevention for BOTH sexes.1,2,3\n\nThe good news is that many people, including doctors, are aware of the numerous benefits of optimal testosterone levels.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are looking for a quick fix with \u201cexogenous\u201d (outside) testosterone \u2014 such as injections and creams that contain testosterone.\n\nThe problem is that when you add testosterone into your body (like an injection), it has many negative side effects if it\u2019s not managed properly. It can actually cause the OPPOSITE effects over time.\n\nDoing it naturally (diet, exercise, supplements) is much better because you won\u2019t have the negative effects and you\u2019ll easily be able to maintain all the benefits long-term.4,5\n\nIt\u2019s always best to do it naturally BEFORE you try \u201cdrugs\u201d.\n\nBesides, even if you wanted to take exogenous testosterone (injections, creams, etc.), by utilizing today\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d methods will only ENHANCE the positive effects and give you even more benefits.6\n\nIncrease Testosterone \u2013 Diet\n\nWhat you eat, is just as important as what you DON\u2019T eat. Food controls your hormones.7\n\nAbout 25-35% of your protein source should be from fish, eggs, and free-range, grass-fed bison/buffalo. All the other sources, even the \u201cfree-range\u201d chicken and cow/beef, still have lots of negative hormones \u2014 despite what the government or \u201clabel\u201d tells you.8,9,10\n\nMake sure you also have WHOLE eggs daily because cholesterol is needed to produce testosterone and other sex hormones. About 2-3 daily is fine.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t increase your cholesterol levels. That\u2019s a myth for the most part.\n\nJust make sure it\u2019s free-range eggs. Try to have it raw and if not, keep the yolk a bit runny and soft.\n\nDon\u2019t overcook your protein or fry it. And stay away from Soy. It causes an increase in estrogen levels.\n\nHave about 40-50% of your diet from healthy carbohydrates \u2014 vegetables, fruits, lentils, yams, quinoa, and some white rice is fine in small amounts.11\n\nEliminate or reduce all sugars, man-made carbs, and processed foods (chips, pasta, bread, etc.)12\n\nMake sure you have some healthy fats, about 25-30% of your diet. It helps produce many of your sex hormones, including testosterone. Most people eat the WRONG forms of fats, which can lower testosterone.13,14,15\n\nGood fats are RAW coconut oil, macadamia oil, hemp oil, avocado, raw nuts/seeds, and egg yolks.\n\nIncrease Testosterone \u2013 Exercise\n\nThe RIGHT type of exercise can have dramatic effects on your hormones \u2014 positive OR negative.\n\nLifting heavy weights (6-12 repetitions) increases testosterone. You only need 3-4x weekly because too often will do the opposite because it\u2019ll increase your stress hormone, Cortisol16 and keep your workouts to 45-60 mins or less.\n\nEliminate intense cardio such as running because it lowers testosterone and increases Cortisol, your stress hormone. If you want to run, keep it less than 20 or 30 min max. Anything over that and your testosterone drops.\n\nIt\u2019s better to take a brisk, 30 min walk 3-5x weekly, preferably outside in the sun.17\n\nIncrease Testosterone \u2013 Life Style\n\nLifestyle changes have to do more with stress management and rest.\n\nSleep is very important. Most of us don\u2019t get enough. So try to get to bed earlier. Squeeze in a little nap in the day as well if you can.18\n\nTry to reduce negativity in your life because it increases your stress hormone, cortisol, and burns out your adrenal glands. 19,20\n\nThis means negative thoughts, information, media \u2026 as well as negative people. You can\u2019t eliminate it, but you can certainly REDUCE some of the negatives in your life.\n\nIncrease Testosterone Supplements \u2013 Herbs & Vitamins\n\nMost of us are deficient in numerous herbs, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s estimated that we would need to eat at least 27,575 calories daily21 to get all the nutrients our bodies need.\n\nAnd even HIGHER as we age, due to poor absorption\n\nBecause of this, I HIGHLY suggest you take specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals to help boost your testosterone levels naturally, from within.\n\nNot only will your libido and sex drive increase, but you\u2019ll feel younger, have more energy, increase your muscle mass and lose belly fat because of the naturally higher testosterone levels.\n\nAnd because this all happens naturally from WITHIN your own body, it\u2019s safe for long-term use.\n\nSome of the most effective and clinically researched herbal remedies for boosting your testosterone are: 22,23,24,25,26\n\nTestofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract (Trigonella foenum-graecum; 50% fenusides, 50% Saponins) Avena Sativa Extract (Oat Straw 100:1) Tongkat Ali Extract (Eurycoma Longifolia Jack 100:1) Maca Root (6% Extract) Bulgarian Pro-Tribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract (90% Sapongenins + 40% protodioscin) Stinging Nettle (95% Extract) (Urtica Dioica) L-Arginine Zinc + Copper \u2026 and actually a few more.\n\nTestofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract (Trigonella foenum-graecum; 50% fenusides, 50% Saponins)\n\nAvena Sativa Extract (Oat Straw 100:1)\n\nTongkat Ali Extract (Eurycoma Longifolia Jack 100:1)\n\nMaca Root (6% Extract)\n\nBulgarian Pro-Tribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract (90% Sapongenins + 40% protodioscin)\n\nStinging Nettle (95% Extract) (Urtica Dioica)\n\n\u2026 and actually a few more.\n\nIncrease Testosterone \u2013 Summary\n\nEating better, exercising daily, and managing your stress levels take time, so please be patient.\n\nTry to make small improvements daily and over the next few weeks and months, you\u2019ll have new habits, a healthier body, and optimal testosterone levels.\n\nIf you want to speed up the process and you\u2019re looking for faster results, adding specific supplements, herbs and vitamins can make dramatic improvements. Plus, it\u2019s easy and convenient.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26839520\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21709300\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9345114\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14501599\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15889125\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7714119\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3360302\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10355847\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14988451\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1984562\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9029197\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21855365\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3360302\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2526906\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6538617\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22234399\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15204068\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10454175\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16298085\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9629234\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20537171\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21242800\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19321573\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2726624\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2526906\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2526906",

Or, try to eat grass-fed beef.\n\nAbout 40%-50% should come from healthy, natural carbohydrates such as vegetables, fruits, white rice, and yams.\n\nEliminate or reduce all man-made, processed carbs and sugars.\n\nMost people just don\u2019t eat enough good, healthy fats and eat too much of the wrong, processed fats.\n\nAbout 25%-30% of your diet should be from whole eggs, RAW coconut oil, macadamia oil, extra virgin olive oil, avocados, and raw nuts/seeds such as walnuts.\n\nI would also add in about 2-4 grams of fish oil daily.\n\nStay away from all vegetable/seed oils \u2026 or try to minimize them.\n\nMost people exercise too much, too long, and do the wrong form.\n\nLift weights, 3-4x weekly and no more, or else your stress hormone cortisol goes up and testosterone goes down.\n\nBut, this means training hard. Don\u2019t just go in and \u201cgo through the motions\u201d.\n\nOne week do 6-10 reps and the next week do 10-15 reps.\n\nKeep your workouts short, fast and intense \u2013 no more than 60 min.\n\nEliminate all intense cardio such as running, jogging, and so forth \u2013 they lower testosterone. Just walk 20-30 min 3-5x weekly\n\nWhen stress hormones such as cortisol go up, testosterone comes down.\n\nSleep is one of the BEST ways to optimize your hormones.\n\nA positive, happy attitude is just as important \u2013 so stop your negative thoughts and complaining. It castrates you\u2026 And so do negative people in your life.\n\nSupplements \u2013 Natural Herbs & Vitamins\n\nMost of us are deficient in numerous herbs, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s estimated that we would need to eat at least 27,575 calories daily to get all the nutrients our bodies need.\n\nAnd even HIGHER as we age, due to poor absorption.\n\nUnfortunately, most supplements don\u2019t do anything and are a waste of money.\n\nHowever, that are specific herbs, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that are clinically proven to increase testosterone levels.\n\nAnd when combined together in the proper, scientifically researched dosages, you can literally optimize and magnify, your \u201cyouthful\u201d, testosterone-boosting hormones.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how quickly the right combinations work and the best part, no side effects.\n\nBut again\u2026 You need to improve your diet, exercise and stress management.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/can-eating-this-fix-your-erectile-dysfunction/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve had a few people constantly ask me if eating watermelon can fix, reverse, and even \u201ccure\u201d erectile dysfunction? Is this true or just some myth?\n\nWell\u2026 the truth is that, NO this is NOT a \u201ccure\u201d for erectile dysfunction. Far from it.\n\nHowever, it is true that a substance in watermelon can improve your erections by increasing your blood flow, directly to the penis, with higher levels of Nitric Oxide.\n\nAnd this is done because watermelon contains an amino acid called L-Citrulline1, which converts to and metabolizes to another amino acid called L-Arginine \u2026 Both of which can increase Nitric Oxide levels and thus, improves blood flow to your penis.\n\nHowever, to really make this work \u2013 you\u2019d have to ingest at least 5 big watermelons daily (the pulp AND the juice) to get the required 10-15 GRAMS (10,000+ milligrams) of L-Citrulline.\n\nObviously, nobody is going to eat this much watermelon, let alone daily.\n\nSo, this is the first problem and why eating this fruit won\u2019t work.\n\nIt\u2019s much easier to just take L-Citrulline and Arginine in supplement powder form \u2014 which by the way, tastes like crap!!!\n\nTaking it in pill form will be extremely expensive, that\u2019s why I suggested powder.\n\nProblem #2 that most people don\u2019t know is that when you take L-Citrulline and/or Arginine, your Prolactin levels ALSO increase.\n\nProlactin would be considered a \u201cfemale\u201d hormone, even though both men and women produce it.\n\nHowever, in women, Prolactin shoots up after birth, to produce milk to feed the baby.\n\nIn men and in women, prolactin causes\n\nbreasts to grow (man boobs!)\n\nit lowers testosterone\n\nhair loss/balding \u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nAND it decreases sex drive and causes impotence!!!\n\nYes, you heard that correctly!!!\n\nNow, this is nature\u2019s way to prevent a new mother from having another baby and procreating. So she can focus only on the newborn baby.\n\nBut, this is a problem for men.\n\nSo taking L-Citrulline and Arginine can initially increase blood flow when used at the correct higher dosage (5 grams or more). But after the increase in Nitric Oxide and also some growth hormone, your body then does the OPPOSITE by increasing the female hormone, Prolactin.2-4\n\nThis is why I tell people to NOT take Citrulline and Arginine unless you only do so 2-3x weekly at the most \u2014 Or else you\u2019re going to increase your Prolactin, which lowers your testosterone, causes accelerated balding, lowers your libido, and can cause impotence.\n\nA Better, More Complete Solution That\u2019s Clinically Proven To Work\n\nIf your goal is to avoid erectile problems, or reverse it or simply increase your libido, then you need a total solution. One that optimizes and balances out multiple hormones \u2014 increasing total and free testosterone, while decreasing female (estrogen, prolactin, progesterone) and stress (cortisol) hormones\u2026 and of course, increasing blood flow as well.\n\nAnd for this, you can copy a proven formula that has worked for thousands of guys, around the world, since 1999.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17352962\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1249182\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10739497\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937800800046",

    "content": "\u201cLow-Intensity Shockwave Therapy\u201d or (LiSWT) is a non-invasive therapy that\u2019s been used in orthopedics for years to help heal broken bones, injured ligaments, and tendons.\n\nSo, this isn\u2019t new technology. However, it is new for use in treating erectile problems.\n\nLiSWT uses targeted high-energy sound waves to improve wound healing and can speed up tissue repair and cell growth. So, it primarily works by supporting healthy blood flow circulation.\n\nIn order to get a strong erection, you need healthy blood flow.\n\nShockwave therapy is administered with a wand-like device placed near different areas of the penis for about 15 minutes, while it emits gentle pulses. No anesthesia is needed.\n\nHowever, there is slight pain for about 1-2 days after.\n\nThe pulses trigger improved blood flow and tissue remodeling in the penis.\n\nThere\u2019s currently no established recommendation for the treatment period or frequency.\n\nClinical trials found that the most common treatment plan was twice weekly for about 6-9 weeks. The results can last up to a year.\n\nThe main problem is that shockwave therapy tends to work best for men with vasculogenic ED, which is a blood vessel disorder that affects blood flow to the tissue in the penis.\n\nUnfortunately, the therapy\u2019s effectiveness with other causes of ED remains to be seen.\n\nAnother problem is that it\u2019s expensive. It\u2019ll cost you anywhere from $500 to $1500 per ONE session. So for 2 sessions a week for 6 week period, that\u2019ll cost you between $6,000 to $18,000.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is worth it when there are natural ways to help fix ED.\n\nBetter (And Cheaper) Solution\n\nThe primary issue with getting an erection is poor hormonal balance \u2013 low testosterone levels, and high female and stress hormones.\n\nAging and other hormones do decrease blood flow circulation to the penis \u2013 so, the goal is to improve BOTH hormones and blood flow at the same time.\n\nTHIS will quickly improve your sex drive and libido, cause better, harder, and fuller erections, and improve performance and sensitivity.\n\nIt\u2019ll also help support healthy prostate function as well \u2013 which is another factor that negatively affects your ability to get an erection.\n\nThe results will be quick and best of all, LONG LASTING.\n\nOh, and it\u2019ll cost a fraction of the price.\n\nI\u2019ve listed two natural solutions that\u2019ll support healthy hormones and blood flow.\n\nIt\u2019s what I personally use.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about how high blood pressure is linked to hair loss and erectile problems.\n\nOf course, high blood pressure is linked to lots of other health problems, but today will stick to hair and erections.\n\nThe real cause of high blood pressure\n\nHow blood pressure drugs cause hair loss and erectile problems\n\nThe TWO blood pressure drugs that can actually GROW head hair and give harder erections\n\nNatural ways to have healthy blood pressure.\n\nAnd this all starts from a subscriber question:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 I have hypertension. I\u2019ve had high blood pressure for a couple of years and now my doctor has put me on medications for it. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve noticed hair loss from it. I was already losing my hair, but ever since taking the drugs for hypertension, the hair loss has sped up. Oh, one other problem\u2026 My erections are very soft now. It\u2019s embarrassing. Should I get off the drugs? I like having hair and good erections. But I also don\u2019t want to get a heart attack or stroke. Is there a connection or am I just being paranoid?\n\nThis is an interesting question for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, I have a family history of high blood pressure \u2013 so, this has been a very important topic for me for over 20 years. I\u2019ll give you the specific natural solution I give to my parents.\n\nUnfortunately, the older we get, the more blood pressure problems we have. And at the same time, the older we get, the more hair loss we have\u2026 And, the worse erections get as well for men.\n\nThe causes of high blood pressure are many factors, such as:\n\nWeaker kidney function due to aging\n\nHigher chance of extra body fat and weight gain, which is more stress on the body.\n\nHigher cholesterol and blood sugar, which indirectly affect blood pressure.\n\nPoor blood flow with plaque build-up or weaker arteries\n\nAnd the biggest problem is hormonal imbalances as we age.\n\nAnd since over 70% of adults have high blood pressure \u2013 this includes both men and women\u2026\n\nThere are also dozens of different blood pressure drugs to be prescribed and thus, make money from by the pharmaceutical companies.\n\nNot only are there so many drugs specifically for blood pressure, but there are over a dozen different CLASSES of blood pressure drugs, such as:\n\nAngiotensin II receptor blockers\n\nCalcium channel blockers\n\nAlpha-2 receptor agonists\n\nCombined alpha and beta-blockers\n\nAll of these drugs have side effects one of them being hair loss and yes, also erectile problems.\n\nHowever, there are TWO exceptions.\n\nThere\u2019s ONE specific hypertension drug, that actually grows head hair.\n\nAnd there\u2019s ONE class of drugs that lowers blood pressure and also improves erections.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll talk about both of these drugs in a minute\u2026\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes \u2013 blood pressure drugs can cause hair loss and more accurately, speed up and accelerate hair loss.\n\nAnd yes, these drugs also cause erection problems.\n\nAlso in women, hypertension drugs can cause diffuse hair loss, which is thinning, but not receding hair loss like it is seen in men.\n\nSo these drugs are bad. Ironically, having high blood pressure is also linked to hair loss in both men and women.\n\nThere are a few clinical studies in humans showing this.\n\nOne with over 610K thousand participants, and another with almost 40K participants, all showing that between 30-45% linking hypertension to hair loss.\n\nAnd this could be because high blood pressure can damage your arteries. Which means blood flow decreases.\n\nAnd high blood pressure and poor blood flow negatively affect all the organs in your body \u2013 your heart, brain, kidneys, and yes, your hair follicles and penis.\n\nWhat Should You Do To Lower Blood Pressure\n\nSo before I continue and reveal natural ways of improving blood pressure, without using blood pressure drugs, which can accelerate hair loss and cause erectile problems \u2026 let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned so far.\n\nHigh blood pressure affects most people as they age.\n\nHigh blood pressure is linked to hair loss and erectile problems.\n\nHypertension drugs have side effects, one of them being hair loss and the other being poor erections.\n\nSo now comes the million dollar question: What are you supposed to do if you have high blood pressure and you want to lower it to healthy levels \u2026 BUT you don\u2019t want to take drugs that have side effects and can cause hair loss or erection problems.\n\nBasically, how can you have healthy blood pressure AND reduce your risk for hair loss or impotence at the same time?\n\nWell, we can do it naturally or with drugs.\n\nI\u2019ll do the drug method in a minute since there are a lot of precautions and potential problems. And, most people will not be able to get access to these 2 specific drugs.\n\nNatural Ways To Lower Blood Pressure\n\nSo, let\u2019s first start with natural ways.\n\nBelieve it or not, a good diet and exercise program will make big improvements in blood pressure.\n\nThe problem with diet and exercise is that:\n\nIt requires a lot of work, discipline, and dedication. So, most people will just not do it long-term\n\nIt does NOT fix the underlying problems of hypertension due to aging and hormonal imbalances.\n\nSo, this is why I also tell people to take specific supplements to help promote healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nBecause the right ingredients work and are clinically researched.\n\nAnd the biggest reason is that it\u2019s so much easier, faster, and more convenient for most people to just take a pill \u2013 rather than change their lifestyle, diet, and exercise program.\n\nWhich means long-term progress and results.\n\nSo, let me quickly list the best, clinically researched ingredients for healthy blood pressure:\n\nHawthorn Berry Extract\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t expect you to purchase all of these individually. It\u2019s too expensive.\n\nThis is why my parents and I take Blood Pressure Optimizer. It has a 20-year proven track record.\n\nIt has the ingredients I\u2019ve mentioned at the correct dosage and extracts.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s so effective that you\u2019re guaranteed results in 30 days or you get a full refund + an extra $100.00 cash back on top of it.\n\nNow, let\u2019s finish off with drug options.\n\nHigh Blood Pressure Drugs And Growing Hair\n\nIn regards to hair loss\u2026\n\nThere is ONE hypertension drug that lowers blood pressure AND grows head hair and that\u2019s called, Minoxidil.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of topical Rogain, which is the trademark name for Minoxidil, which you can now get in generic topical form anywhere.\n\nIt\u2019s used to grow head hair.\n\nHowever, what most people don\u2019t know, is the original ORAL pill containing Minoxidil, was originally a blood pressure drug.\n\nAnd, one of the side-effects or side benefits was hair growth.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s very powerful at growing hair.\n\nUnfortunately, it grows hair on top of your head and everywhere else too \u2013 face, back, shoulders and so forth.\n\nWhen the manufacturer of minoxidil found out about this cool side-effect for hair growth, they made a topical version called Rogain.\n\nThey figured that if Minoxidil is applied topically ONLY to the scalp, then it will only grow hair on the scalp and not the rest of your body, the way the oral pill does.\n\nWhich is partially true.\n\nHowever, anything that\u2019s topically applied, does still get absorbed systematically, into your whole body.\n\nSo topical Minixidil will still cause facial hair growth and it\u2019s really seen when women use it since they naturally have no facial hair.\n\nSince men are already somewhat hair, the body hair growth isn\u2019t as dramatic.\n\nErections And Hair Loss\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about erections and hair loss.\n\nI\u2019ve made an entire video about this and I\u2019ll give you the link to that one at the end of this one.\n\nBut, a short summary is that the ingredient in Viagra, which is Sildenafil, is a PDE5 inhibitor. It works by increasing blood flow.\n\nIt was originally made to improve blood pressure levels and still is, under the trademark name of Revatio.\n\nHowever, one of the side-effects or side benefits of Sildenafil was erections.\n\nSo, the maker of the drug, which is Pfizer, rebranded and renamed the drug Viagra and sold it for erectile dysfunction and made billions.\n\nBy the way, Tadalafil, which is the ingredient found in Cialis, is also a PDE5 inhibitor like Viagra, which also helps lower blood pressure and is also used for erections.\n\nSo, let\u2019s do another quick summary.\n\nPoor blood pressure negatively affects hair loss and erections.\n\nMinoxidil helps lower blood pressure and grow head hair.\n\nPDE5 inhibitors such as Sildenafil and Tadalifl help lower blood pressure and improve erections.\n\nSome of you will think, \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll just use both and I\u2019ll have a full head of hair with rock-hard erections\u201d\u2026.\n\nHowever, the two combined can lower your blood pressure too much.\n\nPlus, you don\u2019t know what interactions both of these drugs will have with each other.\n\nAlso, before I go any further \u2013 I need to give a legal disclaimer \u2013 always speak to your doctor before you do anything. I\u2019m not here to give you any medical advice.\n\nSo, now you have two drug options \u2013 which you\u2019d have to speak to a doctor about and get prescriptions for. Which, 99% of doctors will NOT give you, certainly not for both.\n\nI guess you could order it online without a prescription\u2026 but again, mixing drugs can cause very negative health problems, short and for sure long-term.\n\nThat\u2019s why I suggest you FIRST start by improving your blood pressure with the right lifestyle \u2013 diet, exercise, and natural supplements.\n\nIt\u2019s the BEST long-term solution.\n\nAnd even if you do want to use the previously mentioned drugs, it\u2019s very important that you first make the natural improvements so these drugs work better and at a lower dose, giving you more positives and fewer negative side effects.\n\nSince my family has a history of high blood pressure, I suggest the diet and exercise, and for faster and easier results, take Blood Pressure Optimizer.\n\nSo, please take action, improve your blood pressure, and have healthier hair and better erections.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today, I\u2019m focusing on an issue that many men might not be aware of but can significantly impact their health\u2014high prolactin levels.\n\nElevated prolactin can disrupt your hormonal balance, affecting everything from your libido to your fertility.\n\nUnderstanding Prolactin in Men\n\nProlactin is a hormone primarily known for its role in lactation in women, but men produce it too.\n\nIn men, high levels of prolactin can lead to symptoms such as:\n\nReduced Libido: A decreased interest in sexual activity is often one of the most noticeable symptoms.\n\nErectile Dysfunction: Difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection can occur due to hormonal imbalances influenced by high prolactin.\n\nInfertility: High prolactin levels can interfere with the production of testosterone and sperm, leading to fertility issues.\n\nGynecomastia: The development of enlarged breast tissue in men, which can be uncomfortable and distressing.\n\nDecreased Bone Density: Chronic high prolactin levels can lead to reduced bone density, making bones more susceptible to fractures.\n\nMood Changes: Men with high prolactin levels may experience mood swings, depression, or anxiety.\n\nReduced Body and Facial Hair: High prolactin can impact other hormones that regulate body and facial hair growth, leading to a decrease in hair.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep this hormone in check to maintain your overall health and sexual well-being.\n\nNatural Supplements To Lower Prolactin In Men\n\nNatural supplements are always safer options than pharmaceuticals. Here are some top natural supplements that can help manage prolactin levels:\n\nIngredients like Testofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract, Tongkat Ali, and Avena Sativa (Oat Straw) are known for their potential to boost testosterone levels. Increased testosterone might help balance the ratio of testosterone to prolactin, especially in conditions where prolactin is excessively high.\n\nLH/FSH Support and Nitric Oxide Support: These complexes contain ingredients like Fadogia Agrestis, Tribulus Terrestris, and L-Citrulline, which support luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) production, crucial for testosterone synthesis and overall reproductive health. Enhanced blood flow from nitric oxide boosters can also support hormonal health and sexual function.\n\nVitamin D3 and Vitamin B6: These vitamins play crucial roles in hormone regulation. D3 has been linked to testosterone levels, which can indirectly influence prolactin levels. Vitamin B6, particularly in its active forms like pyridoxine and P5P (pyridoxal-5-phosphate), is vital for the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Dopamine acts as a prolactin-inhibiting factor, meaning it can help lower prolactin levels when elevated.\n\nZinc (Zinmax\u00ae Zinc Picolinate): Zinc is essential for hormone production and can help modulate testosterone levels in the body. It\u2019s also important for the function of enzymes that convert hormones into active or inactive forms, potentially affecting prolactin regulation.\n\nSelenium and Copper: These trace minerals are included for their roles in overall endocrine health and antioxidant protection, which is crucial for maintaining a balanced hormonal environment.\n\nIf you want to boost testosterone while managing prolactin, I recommend AlphaViril.\n\nThis natural supplement not only helps in reducing high prolactin levels but also boosts testosterone, enhances libido, and improves overall hormonal balance.\n\nAlphaViril is designed to work synergistically with your body to promote optimal hormonal health.\n\nHow to Safely Use Supplements\n\nWhile incorporating these supplements, here are a few tips to ensure effectiveness and safety:\n\nStart with lower doses and adjust based on your body\u2019s response.\n\nBe consistent with your supplementation for best results.\n\nMonitor your symptoms and hormone levels through regular check-ups.\n\nLifestyle Changes for Better Results\n\nCombining supplements with healthy lifestyle changes can dramatically improve your hormonal health.\n\nFocus on reducing stress, getting quality sleep, and maintaining a healthy diet to naturally lower prolactin levels.\n\nRegain Your Hormonal Health\n\nHigh prolactin levels don\u2019t have to hold you back from living a healthy and active life.\n\nWith the right natural supplements like AlphaViril, and positive lifestyle habits, you can regain control over your hormonal health and improve your quality of life.",

    "content": "\"Increase My Libido & Testosterone\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb I get asked all the time, \u201cIs there a way to know my testosterone levels without doing a hormone test?\u201d\n\nI would initially ask questions such as:\n\nhow is your libido or ability to get erections?\n\nhow are your energy levels?\n\nis your belly fat growing?\n\nhow is your mood & \u201cdrive\u201d for life?\n\nThe better your testosterone levels and hormonal balance, the better you look and the younger you\u2019ll feel.\n\nPhysical Test For Testosterone Levels\n\nHowever, there is a physical test that can give you some insight as to how your testosterone levels are, and that\u2019s with the finger test.\n\nHold your right hand up in front of you as if you were trying to protect your face in a food fight. Now, look at it\u2026.\n\nIs your ring finger (the fourth finger, counting the thumb) considerably longer than the finger you point with (the second, \u201cindex\u201d finger)?\n\nIf your ring finger is longer, consider yourself lucky.\n\nIt seems that finger size, or more specifically, finger ratio, correlates strongly with \u201chigher\u201d testosterone levels, as well as better success in a variety of sports.1\n\nAs you see in the picture above, the one on the left side \u2013 the ring finger is longer than the index, \u201cpointer\u201d finger. This means higher testosterone levels.\n\nYou\u2019re Crazy Dr. Sam!\n\nNow you might think I\u2019m making this up, but I\u2019m not.\n\nScientists have long noticed that men\u2019s ring fingers are generally longer than their index fingers.\n\nWith women, it tends to be the reverse: their index fingers are usually longer.\n\nThey\u2019ve called this difference in length between the index finger and ring finger the \u201c2D:4D ratio.\u201d\n\n2D stands for \u201csecond digit\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s your index finger, and 4D means \u201cfourth digit\u201d \u2014 your ring finger.\n\nSo if your index finger is 2.9 inches long and your ring finger is 3.1 inches long, you have a 2D:4D ratio of .935 (2.9/3.1 = .935).\n\nA longer ring finger compared to your index finger is considered a \u201clow 2D:4D ratio.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, the ring finger seems to have a higher number of receptors for testosterone during early fetal development. Thus, the ring finger grows in proportion to the amount of testosterone produced.\n\nThe more testosterone produced, the lower the eventual 2D:4D ratio.\n\nInterestingly, the 4th digit of the right hand is more sensitive to fetal testosterone than the ring finger of the left hand, so use your right hand to appraise your Testosterone levels.\n\nA longer ring finger is merely a biomarker of high levels of fetal testosterone, and this early surge of testosterone is instrumental in influencing the growth of not only the brain and heart but also muscle and bone, all of which are vital to sports performance.\n\nHowever, I want to point out that even though this has been scientifically proven in 1980, 1998 and again in 2011\u2026 This doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate where your current testosterone levels are right NOW.\n\nLifestyle (diet, exercise, stress management, supplements) and more importantly, aging \u2013 are bigger and indicators of where your TRUE testosterone levels are at this moment.\n\nUnfortunately, testosterone levels do drop as aging and there\u2019s a simple & fast way to increase your testosterone levels today\u2026\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nTomkinson, Grant, Dyer, Makailah, \u201cFinger Length Could Predict Athletic Ability.\u201d LiveScience, September 7, 2017.\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886983900612\n\nhttps://fingerlengthdigitratio.wordpress.com/tag/john-manning/\n\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/108/39/16289",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/3-worst-foods-for-your-prostate-clinically-proven/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to list the 3 worst foods that are bad for your prostate. These foods are linked to prostate cancer in clinical studies.\n\nAdditionally, they can cause prostate growth, which will cause urinary problems and erectile issues.\n\nI\u2019ll also give you 3 additional popular foods to avoid because those are linked to prostate problems indirectly.\n\nAnd since like you, I\u2019m concerned about prostate problems and my dad had prostate growth, I\u2019ll let you know what supplements I take, which help promote healthy prostate function, improved testosterone levels, increased libido and better erections.\n\nSo, if you are concerned about future prostate problems and especially if you already have prostate problems, then this is a must-read topic for you.\n\nAnd I mention this because prostate cancer is the #1 leading cause of cancer in men.\n\nSurprisingly, skin cancer is ranked #2\n\nIronically, both of these 2 cancers have been shown to have a deficiency or low levels of Vitamin D3.\n\nAging And Prostate Problems\n\nNow, not all prostate problems are cancerous.\n\nBPH or Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, which means there\u2019s growth in the prostate gland causing problems with urination and erections\u2026 .Affects 50% of men over the age of 50 and 80% over the age of 65.\n\nBasically, this means that your prostate grows as you get older, many times related to hormonal imbalances.\n\nAnd, the older men get, the worse the hormones and the bigger the prostate problems \u2013 which can lead to prostate cancer.\n\nI\u2019ll also show you how you can optimize your hormones to reduce the risk of prostate problems, while also improving your:\n\nMuscle size and strength\n\nAnd yes, increasing your libido and producing harder, bigger erections.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s get started with the 3 worst foods for your prostate.\n\nProstate Health & Meat\n\nLet\u2019s first talk about red meat or beef.\n\nThe connection between prostate cancer and the consumption of mass-produced beef was established by the American Institute for Cancer Research more than twenty years ago.\n\nBeef that is produced for mass marketing is raised on foods cows are not meant to eat, like corn, grain, and soy.\n\nCows are supposed to eat grass.\n\nFoods such as grains, corn, and soy cause negative chemical and hormonal changes in cows. Then we add in the addition of hormones to make the cows grow bigger and fatter, antibiotics to keep them alive and how the cows are raised and killed are all bad for the cows.\n\nAnd remember, it\u2019s not always what you eat, it\u2019s also what you eat, and what IT ate is the real problem.\n\nThese same issues are also seen in mass-produced pork and chicken.\n\nYou also want to avoid eating fake meats like lunch meats and processed, packaged meats.\n\nBy the way, grass-fed beef and pasture-raised chicken don\u2019t seem to be associated with the same negative effects.\n\nDiary is another big problem, which has also been associated with prostate problems.\n\nRemember, milk is for babies. Cow milk is for baby cows.\n\nAnd remember how earlier I mentioned all the problems with red meat and beef? Well, all of those problems and negative hormonal and chemical changes are even more focused on the milk.\n\nOne thing to know is that the studies focused on dairy from milk, hard cheeses and ice cream. Yogurt may be safer.\n\nSheep yogurt is much better.\n\nNOTE: Both dairy and mass-produced meats of high saturated fats and that has also been linked to prostate problems.\n\nAlcohol is another big problem for the prostate and just recently in 2022, there was a clinical study showing a strong link between alcohol consumption and the development of prostate cancer.\n\nThe truth is, alcohol is just bad for everything.\n\nThere is absolutely no benefit of alcohol for the body or mind.\n\nAnd yes, this includes all the BS statements about heart health and red wine and resveratrol. It\u2019s all been proven to be false.\n\nAlcohol is a toxin. It\u2019s sugar + ethanol. Both are bad and accelerate aging.\n\nNow, those are the 3 worst foods. I\u2019ll also give you 3 popular bonus foods you should avoid because they can irritate the prostate.\n\nHormonal Imbalances And Prostate\n\nHowever, all of these problems related to the prostate, as mentioned at the beginning of this article are hormonal imbalances.\n\nLower testosterone levels \u2013 which causes muscle loss, loss of strength, low energy, low drive, libido, and erectile problems.\n\nHigher estrogen levels \u2013 which causes man boobs or gynecomastia, depression, apathy, loss of drive, and body fat growth, especially belly fat in men\n\nHigher DHT levels \u2013 which are linked to hair loss and balding, excess body hair growth, and yes, prostate enlargement.\n\nAs we age, these hormonal imbalances only get worse.\n\nIronically, when you are young, in your teenage years and 20\u2019s when you have no prostate problems, you have the OPPOSITE hormonal levels.\n\nHigh testosterone levels\n\nNormal estrogen levels\n\nThis is why when you\u2019re younger your prostate is healthy, you have more muscle, less body fat, higher libido, and an easier time getting erections.\n\nThis is why I started using AlphaViril over 20+ years ago to help produce optimal hormonal balance, which also supports healthy prostate function.\n\nIt comes with a one-year guarantee.\n\nIn fact, you\u2019re guaranteed results in 30 days or you\u2019ll get a full refund + you\u2019ll get an EXTRA $100 cash back.\n\nI can make this guarantee because I made it for myself, I wanted the best and it comes with 20 years of user proof from people like yourself \u2013 so you know you\u2019ve got nothing to risk or lose.\n\nNow, as promised there are also 3 other foods you should reduce because they are indirectly linked to prostate problems.\n\nThis is because sugar increases insulin levels, which can cause tumor growth. Sugar is also inflammatory, which can irritate the prostate.\n\nSo, reduce your sugar intake and simple carbohydrates. There\u2019s nothing wrong with carbs, just stick to natural forms found in whole grains, yams, fruits, and vegetables.\n\nCaffeine can be bad news for an enlarged prostate because it irritates the bladder and increases the urge to urinate frequently, especially at night.\n\nTwo other big problems with caffeine are the increase in stress hormones such as cortisol, which is bad for all of your hormones, especially testosterone.\n\nAs stress hormones go up, testosterone levels come down.\n\nCaffeine and similar stimulants also reduce sleep quality, depth, and duration. ALL of which are bad for your health and can cause cancer cells to grow.\n\nRemember, sleep is the time your body heals.\n\nSpicy foods can be a problem because they can aggravate symptoms such as frequent urination and difficulty urinating.\n\nThe spices in these foods irritate the lining of the bladder, leading to further inflammation, which can worsen the symptoms.\n\nSpices can also make urine more acidic, further irritating the prostate.\n\nThere you have it. Now, let me quickly summarize things for you since I know this was a long article.\n\nProstate cancer is the leading cause of death in men\n\nBy the age of 50, 50% of men have prostate problems and growth. By the age of 65, 70% have prostate issues.\n\nBPH, which stands for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia \u2013 means the prostate grows as men age, due to hormonal imbalances. However, it doesn\u2019t also lead to prostate cancer.\n\nYour goal is to optimize your hormones to youthful levels for healthy prostate function, sexual performance, and muscle mass. I use AlphaViril .\n\nThe 3 worst foods are mass-produced meats such as beef, pork, and chicken, dairy, and alcohol.

    "content": "Today I want to share something personal with you.\n\nI\u2019ve been taking steroids every day for many years, but before you jump to conclusions, let me clarify that I\u2019m talking about Vitamin D.\n\nYes, Vitamin D is technically a steroid hormone, and it\u2019s incredibly important for our health.\n\nI found out I was deficient in this crucial nutrient despite thinking I was doing everything right for my health.\n\nMy energy was low, I was getting sick more often than usual, and overall, things just didn\u2019t feel right.\n\nNow, many of you might think of Vitamin D as just a vitamin, but it\u2019s much more than that.\n\nIt\u2019s a steroid hormone that plays a vital role in our body, affecting everything from testosterone levels in men to mood and energy levels.\n\nWhat\u2019s shocking is that most people are deficient in Vitamin D or have suboptimal levels.\n\nThis is not something that can easily be corrected through diet or casual sun exposure.\n\nMy Own Jurney With This Steroid\n\nMy own journey with Vitamin D deficiency led me to understand the importance of getting enough sun exposure and supplementing correctly.\n\nI used to spend a lot of time in the sun during the \u201980s and \u201990s, trying to tan as much as possible, but as I got older and my lifestyle changed, my sun exposure drastically reduced, leading to lower Vitamin D levels.\n\nAfter discovering my deficiency, I started supplementing with Vitamin D3, combined with Vitamin K2, to enhance absorption and avoid potential side effects like calcium deposits in arteries.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that managing Vitamin D levels is more complex than just taking a supplement.\n\nIt involves understanding your body\u2019s unique needs, which can vary based on factors like skin color, body fat, and age.\n\nFor instance, darker-skinned individuals and those with higher body fat percentages may need more Vitamin D.\n\nThrough my experience, I realized the importance of personalized healthcare and regular monitoring of Vitamin D levels to maintain optimal health.\n\nThe Importance Of Vitamin D Levels\n\nI encourage everyone to take their Vitamin D levels seriously.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about bone health; Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to a range of health issues, including mood disorders, energy fluctuations, and even more serious conditions like certain cancers.\n\nSo, don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re feeling unwell to check your Vitamin D levels.\n\nDo regular testing and supplement with the correct form and dosage \u2013 like in Perfect Vitamin D+K \u2013 as it can make a significant difference in your overall health and well-being.\n\nRemember, taking action on this knowledge can lead to a happier, healthier life.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/5-worst-foods-that-lower-your-testosterone-libido/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and a little while ago I did a video about the \u201c3 Best Foods For Increasing Your Testosterone & Libido\u201d.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to do the opposite and reveal the 5 WORST foods that LOWER your testosterone & libido and thus, foods you want to reduce, avoid or eliminate from your diet.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t worry \u2026 if you still want to consume these foods, there is a workaround and a simple fix, and that\u2019s by taking specific vitamins, minerals, and herbs to help undo some of the damage.\n\nHowever, improving your diet should be the priority.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started and these are in no particular order.\n\nSome of you may have heard how soy products can lower testosterone levels. This is true and false.\n\nIn older studies, it did show that the phytoestrogens found in soy, which act as estrogen or are estrogen-like compounds, can lower testosterone levels.\n\nFor example, a 2013 research study found that men drinking 20 grams of soy protein isolate per day over a two-week span, showed lower Testosterone levels than those who drank whey protein isolate or a placebo.\n\nHowever, newer studies and meta-analyses have shown no effects of soy on testosterone levels.\n\nSo what should you do? What do I suggest?\n\nWell, if you\u2019re a vegan, then eat your soy protein. It\u2019s a good source of protein and vegans need a lot more complete proteins.\n\nHowever, if you are not a vegan, then I\u2019d limit my soy protein intake. I wouldn\u2019t consume processed soy such as soy protein powder or tofu and similar high-protein substances and foods.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to have some edamame or maybe tempeh. It\u2019s more natural.\n\nOn the other hand, I do believe dairy products are bad for your health, especially for your hormone and testosterone levels.\n\nOne main reason is the actual cows. You see, pregnant female cows are the primary source of milk that\u2019s produced and sold commercially, and their milk is filled with estrogens and progesterone because these cows are drugged up all the time.\n\nThose hormones adversely affect testosterone by suppressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which men need for the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing hormone (LH). When they\u2019re not released, your testes can\u2019t synthesize testosterone.\n\nA 2010 analysis supports the adverse relationship between dairy products and men\u2019s hormones. It\u2019s also worth noting that 98 percent of soybean meal is used for animal feed, so chances are that estrogen levels in cows\u2019 milk are even further increased.\n\nMilk causes digestive problems, gas, bloating, and extra mucus \u2013 simply stated, most adults don\u2019t do well with milk, especially the commercial milk found in our supermarkets.\n\nThis includes any dairy product that contains milk \u2013 so read your labels.\n\nIn Pumping Iron, Arnold Schwarzenegger said how \u201cmilk is for babies\u201d and \u201cwhen you grow up, you drink beer\u201d.\n\nWell, Arnold was right and wrong.\n\nHe was correct about the milk being for babies, but alcohol is problematic for testosterone levels, especially beer.\n\nThe truth is, there is no real benefit to any form of alcohol for your body or brain, despite what some studies may say.\n\nAlcohol is a poison. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nNow, if you want to drink 1 or 2 glasses of alcohol a WEEK, that\u2019s fine. But doing it daily isn\u2019t good and binging on it on the weekends is even worse.\n\nThis is one reason guys get what\u2019s called \u201cwhisky dick\u201d and can\u2019t perform sexually when they drink too much \u2013 an instant decrease in testosterone.\n\nAlcohol might be good for reducing inhibitions, but not good for physical or sexual performance.\n\nYes, alcohol will decrease testosterone and yes it will increase cortisol, and stress hormones\u2026 and increase inflammation. All being bad for your hormones and sexual performance.\n\nPlus, alcohol ruins deep sleep, which is when a major portion of your testosterone is produced, and thus, less testosterone production results.\n\nI know this one food people don\u2019t want to hear is bad for your testosterone, but\u2026 now you know. The choice is yours.\n\nAnother food type that\u2019s bad for your testosterone and sexual performance is certain fats, more specifically transfats. And, these are primarily found in processed foods and baked goods.\n\nHaving too many omega-6 fats from seed & vegetable oils can also be a problem.\n\nCertain fats are good for your health and are needed, including testosterone production \u2013 as I mentioned in my previous videos.\n\nHowever, read the labels and try your best to reduce trans, hydrogenated, and high omega-6 seed & vegetable oil fats. Again, these fats are primarily found in packaged foods, especially those high in carbohydrates\u2026 such as chips, pastries & desserts.\n\nFinally, sugar is another food that\u2019s very problematic for your health, but also your testosterone levels.\n\nResearch shows that the average American male ingests about 17-20 teaspoons of sugar daily\u2014that\u2019s more than double the recommended limit.\n\nThe problem with sugar is that it can drop your testosterone levels by more than 25% quickly, right after ingestion and testosterone levels remain lower for 2-3 hours.\n\nAnd the bigger problem is that these days, sugar is found in so many foods.\n\nYes, the obvious sugar is in sodas. But, a lot of pre-workout drinks are full of sugar. If you drink juice, that\u2019s just as bad as a soda.\n\nPeople having their fancy expensive high-calorie, yummy coffees, again \u2013 usually full of sugar.\n\nUsing any kind of syrup, agave, and similar substances \u2013 are all sugar under different names.\n\nIt\u2019s not good for your testosterone levels, insulin, or stress hormones.\n\nIt\u2019s not good for your mood or energy. Sugar causes muscle loss and increases belly fat.\n\nSadly, of all the testosterone-killing foods on this list, sugar is arguably the easiest and the most difficult one to eliminate from your diet.\n\nStart slow and build a consistent habit of reducing the foods I\u2019ve mentioned today for better health, fitness, and longevity \u2026 in addition to higher testosterone levels and better sexual performance.

    "content": "Are you looking to optimize your workouts and boost your testosterone levels naturally?\n\nCreatine is a well-known supplement for athletes and bodybuilders who want to increase strength and improve muscle endurance.\n\nHowever recent claims suggest that it may also have an impact on your testosterone levels.\n\nBefore you rush to the nearest supplement store, we will try to separate fact from fiction.\n\nDr.Sam Robbins analyses the studies and experts\u2019 insight and reveals the relationship between creatine and testosterone.\n\nWhat Is Creatine And How Does It Work\n\nCreatine is a naturally occurring compound found in small amounts in certain foods, primarily meat and seafood.\n\nIt is also produced by the body in small quantities.\n\nHowever, for those seeking to maximize their athletic performance and muscle gains, supplementing with creatine has become popular.\n\nCreatine is converted into creatine phosphate, which plays a vital role in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy source.\n\nBy increasing the availability of ATP, creatine allows muscles to perform at a higher intensity, leading to improved strength and endurance.\n\nBut what about the link between creatine and testosterone?\n\nTo understand this relationship, you need to understand the role of testosterone in the body and its impact on muscle growth and performance.\n\nThe Relationship Between Creatine And Testosterone\n\nTestosterone is a hormone primarily produced in the testes in men and in smaller amounts in the ovaries and adrenal glands in women.\n\nIt plays a crucial role in the development of male reproductive tissues and secondary sexual characteristics, such as increased muscle mass and bone density.\n\nWhile creatine is not directly responsible for increasing testosterone levels, research suggests that it may indirectly influence testosterone production and utilization in the body.\n\nOne study published in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine found that creatine led to an increase in serum testosterone levels in rugby players after resistance training.\n\nThe exact mechanisms behind this relationship are not yet fully understood.\n\nHowever, creatine may enhance testosterone levels by optimizing the body\u2019s energy systems and reducing oxidative stress. This promotes an environment for testosterone production and utilization.\n\nScientific Studies On Creatine And Testosterone Levels\n\nNumerous scientific studies have explored the potential impact of creatine supplementation on testosterone levels in both athletes and non-athletes.\n\nWhile some studies have reported positive findings, others have failed to observe a significant effect.\n\nA study published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine investigated the effects of creatine supplementation on testosterone levels in professional soccer players. The researchers found that creatine supplementation had no significant impact on testosterone levels compared to a placebo group.\n\nIn contrast, a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research examined the effects of creatine supplementation on hormone profiles in college football players. The results showed a significant increase in testosterone levels after six weeks of creatine supplementation.\n\nBenefits Of Using Creatine For Testosterone\n\nDespite the mixed findings regarding its direct impact on testosterone levels, creatine supplementation offers a lot of benefits.\n\nBy enhancing muscle strength, endurance, and recovery, creatine can indirectly support testosterone optimization.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of creatine supplementation is its ability to increase muscle strength and power.\n\nAdditionally, creatine has been shown to improve muscle endurance, so you can perform more repetitions or maintain higher intensity during training.\n\nBy reducing fatigue, creatine supplementation can lead to greater muscle stress, facilitating muscle growth.\n\nFurthermore, creatine has been found to accelerate post-workout recovery. By replenishing ATP stores efficiently, creatine supplementation may reduce muscle damage and inflammation, allowing faster recovery.\n\nDosage And Timing For Creatine Supplementation\n\nTo get most of the creatine benefits, you need to follow proper dosage and timing guidelines.\n\nThe recommended dosage for creatine supplementation is 3-5 grams per day.\n\nYou may also choose to follow a \u201cloading phase\u201d of 20 grams per day for the first week to saturate your muscles with creatine.\n\nThe timing of creatine supplementation is also important.\n\nThe best time to take creatine is immediately after a workout. Alternatively, you can take it with a meal that contains carbs to improve absorption.\n\nIndividual responses to creatine supplementation may vary, and you should always start small and see how you feel.\n\nPotential Side Effects\n\nWhile generally considered safe, creatine may have some side effects and risks.\n\nThe most common side effect of creatine supplementation is water retention, which may lead to temporary weight gain.\n\nThis is primarily due to creatine\u2019s ability to pull water into the muscles, and it\u2019s not fat gain. Also, it\u2019s usually temporary.\n\nSome people may also experience gastrointestinal problems, such as bloating, cramping, or diarrhea. If you have digestion problems, reduce the dose or take it with meals.\n\nIf you have pre-existing kidney or liver conditions, you should probably avoid creatine as it can put extra stress on these organs.\n\nNatural Ways To Boost Testosterone Levels\n\nWhile creatine may offer potential benefits, you must optimize your testosterone levels to increase your muscles and strength.\n\nNatural solutions can help with boosting your testosterone levels, without side effects.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Things like what you eat, how much body fat you have, and your genetics can all come into play.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, there are things you can do to get those levels back in check. You could try changing up your diet, taking some supplements, or even some medication.\n\nTo reduce estrogen levels, you can take supplements like white button mushroom extract and DIM or use hardcore drugs like aromatase inhibitors. Not only will this help lower your estrogen, but it can also indirectly increase your testosterone levels.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that low levels of estrogen should be avoided, as this hormone has many benefits for your brain, including improving libido and muscle growth.\n\nTo reduce estrogenic compounds in your body, try incorporating natural proteins like grass-fed beef, wild-caught fish, and pasture-raised chicken and eggs into your diet.\n\nNatural estrogen blockers and inhibitors, such as DIM and grape seed extract, can also be used to lower estrogen levels.\n\nFor an even more powerful impact, try AlphaViril, a testosterone-boosting supplement that not only increases testosterone levels but also helps to lower excess estrogen levels and balance DHT levels.\n\nFinally, if you want to balance your estrogen and testosterone levels, consider reducing external estrogens found in milk and processed meats.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/how-many-days-a-week-should-i-workout-for-maximum-testosterone-levels/",
    "content": "Some time ago I wrote a really popular article called \u201c4 Clinically Proven Ways To Increase Your Testosterone Levels, Naturally\u201d\n\nIn that article, one of the things I discussed was the best way to increase your testosterone levels based on the type of workouts you do.\n\nBut to get to the point, I mentioned you should NOT do cardio, you should lift weights and do so only 3-4x weekly \u2013 never more.\n\nTestosterone & Cortisol Correlation\n\nNow, one question I got asked repeatedly was, \u201cWhat if I workout 5-6x weekly, but just do one body every time? Will this still increase my testosterone or will it lower it?\u201d\n\nThis is a good question and on paper, you would assume it works out the same. You can do your entire body in 3 workouts or 6 workouts \u2013 who cares, right?\n\nWell, over and over again I\u2019ve tested this theory on myself\u2026 as well as so many of my other athletes. And the fact is that working out with weights almost every day (5-6x weekly) actually causes a decrease in testosterone because it increases cortisol \u2013 your stress hormone.\n\nAnd as cortisol goes up, testosterone goes down.\n\nIt\u2019s All About Recovery\u2026\n\nYour muscles can recover very quickly \u2013 usually in about 48 hours.\n\nYour joints, tendons, and ligaments take longer to recover \u2026 typically about 4-5 days or longer.\n\nThis is because your muscles have better blood flow than your tendons.\n\nHowever, your nervous system (CNS) takes the LONGEST to recover \u2013 a week or longer.\n\nThus, working out daily can be fine for your muscles, but NOT for your nervous system (CNS)\n\nSo even though your biceps might be resting the entire week, your CNS never rests because it\u2019s going to the gym daily and getting worn out.\n\nDo this for a few weeks and slowly you overtrain, lose strength, your cortisol goes up and testosterone comes down.\n\nPlus, when you\u2019re only working out ONE body part at a time, you tend to push more and harder. Again, that\u2019s fine for the muscle, but NOT for the CNS.\n\nHowever, if you want to workout more, you have a couple of options:\n\nYou workout 5-6x weekly, but do so for 2 weeks and then the 3rd week, do less by going only 3x weekly for a week. So more volume for 2 weeks, then lower volume for 1 week to allow your CNS to recover.\n\nMake sure you take supplements to increase your testosterone while decreasing your stress hormones. Now you can do more and still protect your testosterone. This is how steroids work.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/selegiline-doctor-gives-dos-donts-recommendations/",
    "content": "A little while ago, I wrote an article entitled, Refractory Period \u2013 How To Have More Orgasms, Better Sex & Fix \u201cED\u201d.\n\nIn the video, I mentioned a drug called Selegiline, also known as L-Deprenyl or Eldepryl.\n\nI stated that this is a drug I\u2019ve used on and off for over 20 years.\n\nI didn\u2019t say much about it, but I asked my subscribers if they wanted more details about Selegiline, to let me know in the comments section.\n\nWell, I got a bunch of people asking questions and that\u2019s what today\u2019s topic is going to be about \u2013 Selegiline:\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nWhat is it prescribed for?\n\nHow to use it correctly \u2013 for sex drive, better mood, brain health, longevity, and so forth.\n\nThe best dosages, timing, etc.\n\nLastly, potential warnings.\n\nAnd before I start, I need to give a polite legal disclaimer: Please don\u2019t do anything unless you speak to your doctor first. This is for entertainment purposes only.\n\nIt\u2019s a medication called monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor. This is an enzyme which sucks up the dopamine that is not being used by your brain.\n\nBy inhibiting this MAO-B enzyme, there\u2019s more dopamine available for your brain to use.\n\nThis is why they prescribe such drugs to Parkinson\u2019s patients because they lack dopamine production and sensitivity to dopamine.\n\nThus, Selegiline is one such drug prescribed to Parkinson\u2019s patients, usually combined with levodopa\u2026. Which is a precursor to dopamine.\n\nThis means that your body can now hopefully produce MORE dopamine and ALSO better use of the dopamine that\u2019s available. This is a double benefit.\n\nAnd for those of you who don\u2019t know, dopamine is a neurotransmitter made in your brain. Some also categorize it as a hormone.\n\nSome call Dopamine the \u201cpleasure\u201d chemical because it\u2019s associated with sex, gambling, porn, eating and similar events.\n\nDopamine plays a role as a \u201creward center\u201d \u2026 and in many body functions, including memory, muscle movement, motivation, mood, attention, and more.\n\nHigh or low dopamine levels are associated with diseases including Parkinson\u2019s disease, restless legs syndrome, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nHow Does Selegiline Relate to Better Sex Drive?\n\nOkay, so now you know what it is, how it works, what it\u2019s prescribed for, and some of the benefits.\n\nBut, how does all of this relate to a better sex drive, having more orgasms, improved mood, neuroprotective and brain health, increased motivation, and could be one of the most potent and safest anti-aging drugs?\u2026\n\nWell, let me first share a quick story with you related to my usage of Selegiline.\n\nIt was in my early 20s and a bodybuilding friend of mine was telling me about all the biohacking stuff he was using to improve his body.\n\nYes, steroids were one of them \u2013 but also brain stuff such as nootropics.\n\nThis was 30 years ago, way ahead of all the proclaimed biohacking experts.\n\nI started using a bunch of stuff and he suggested Selegiline to keep me focused in school. I always had a hard time paying attention in class\u2026since I was thinking about going to the gym, making money, and of course, girls!\n\nAnyway, I noticed my memory, attention, motivation, and mood all improved.\n\nOver time though, I stopped taking some of these substances and Selegiline was one of them. I think I had a hard time getting it.\n\nAnyway, about 10 years later, I read in one of the life extension magazines about Selegiline and how it\u2019s one of the most anti-aging, and neuroprotective brain health drugs\u2026 that\u2019s also safe.\n\nThis was also about the same time my aunt was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nSo, I started taking it for all the benefits I mentioned, PLUS to help reduce my own risk of getting Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nDopamine Over Production & Refractory Period\n\nThis is especially important these days because so many people are overstimulated due to the internet and mobile phones that they are OVER producing dopamine, which could mean less production later in life and at the same time, less sensitivity to it NOW.\n\nNow, when you don\u2019t produce as much dopamine, prolactin levels can go up and in men, this means lower sex drive and a decrease in your ability to have more orgasms, more often.\n\nThis is where the refractory period comes in.\n\nBefore sex, you are \u201chunting\u201d and \u201csearching\u201d to have intercourse. Your dopamine levels go up. After you orgasm, dopamine drops, and prolactin levels go up.\n\nThis creates a calming effect.\n\nOver time, prolactin levels go back down and dopamine levels go back up. And now, you can get an erection again and have an orgasm.\n\nWhen you\u2019re younger, this \u201crefractory\u201d period is short or shorter. As you age, it gets longer and longer.\n\nWhen at one time you could have 2-3 orgasms in a day, years later you might have 1 or 2 orgasms a week and eventually maybe just a month or longer.\n\nThere are many hormonal reasons for this and of course, dopamine is one of these factors.\n\nBut by using selegiline, you can improve dopamine levels and thus, reduce your refractory period, have an erection and orgasm more often, and all the other benefits I mentioned \u2013 brain health, better mood, more motivation, longevity, etc., etc.\n\nHow And When To Take Selegiline?\n\nSince none of us have Parkinson\u2019s disease, you do NOT take the prescribed dosage, which is typically 5 to 10 mg daily. And Selegiline comes in 5 mg tablets.\n\nThe ideal dosage and the one I take is 1 mg daily. Yes, that\u2019s just 10% of the prescribed dosage for Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nNow, I just take a 5 mg tablet and cut it into quarters and that means I take about 1.25 mg daily. So, that\u2019s close enough.\n\nSelegiline\u2019s half-life is about 2-3 hours. It\u2019s fast-acting. So, most of it at this low dose is out of your system in about 4-5 hours.\n\nKeep in mind taking it gives you a little bit of a high. You\u2019re amped up and that\u2019s because a metabolite of it is partially converted to amphetamine.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re going to get drug tested, know that it can show positive for amphetamines.\n\nI mention all of this because you obviously don\u2019t want to take it in the evening or before bed, it\u2019s going to cause insomnia.\n\nSo, the best time to take it and when I do is first thing in the morning.\n\nNow, if you want to use it for sexual reasons or to feel better and more motivated, then use it about an hour before sex, going to a party or giving a speech, or some other social event.\n\nOr, where do you get Selegiline? \u2026 It\u2019s a prescription drug, so you can ask your doctor. Besides that, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I can\u2019t give you sources. But, you can do your own research.\n\nHowever, what if you can\u2019t get Selegiline or you don\u2019t want to take a drug? Are there natural alternatives?\n\nYes, there are lots of things you can do.\n\nFor example, Mucuna Pruriens Extract at 25% L-Dopa works like the drug Levodopa and if you recall, it helps replace the missing dopamine in the brain because it\u2019s a precursor to dopamine.\n\nThat\u2019s why I included it in AlphaViril, to help promote healthy dopamine levels.\n\nCombined with the testosterone-boosting herbs and other pro-sexual ingredients, AlphaViril will over time, help increase your ability to have sex more often, with better erections and more orgasms.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "If you have frequent urine problems, then today\u2019s video is perfect for you. I\u2019ll discuss the 5 primary causes and best solutions to help improve and hopefully fix this situation for you.\n\nPlease know that frequent urinary problems can definitely be a warning sign for much bigger health problems. So, please read to the end.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started.\n\nFrequent Urination Causes\n\nUrinary Tract Infection (UTI)\n\nInfections in any part of the urinary system can cause frequent urination. Symptoms may also include a burning sensation during urination, cloudy urine, and a strong urge to urinate.\n\nYour doctor will do a simple test to see if you have a UTI or not.\n\nSOLUTION: Luckily, the solution is a course of antibiotics, so that\u2019s easy enough.\n\nDiabetes (both Type 1 and Type 2)\n\nHigh blood sugar levels can increase urination as the body tries to eliminate excess sugar.\n\nIn fact, I tend to urinate a lot and have my entire life, even as a child. I\u2019ve always been thirsty, drinking lots of water and peeing a lot. And I remember that as a child, my pediatrician tested me for diabetes because frequent urinating is a warning sign.\n\nLuckily, I don\u2019t have diabetes and I think I just drink a lot of water.\n\nSOLUTION: If you have diabetes or just have high blood sugar in general, an improved diet and proper medication can fix this. Mainly it\u2019s a diet thing \u2013 managing your blood sugar and insulin levels by limiting high carb or sugar intake, processed foods, unhealthy fats, and similar foods.\n\nYou can also take specific supplements that will help promote healthy blood sugar levels, without negative drug side effects.\n\nPlease know that improving your blood sugar will improve EVERY aspect of your health, so make this a priority.\n\nIn men, conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, or prostate cancer can cause frequent urination in men, especially at night.\n\nAging and hormonal imbalances are the primary causes of prostate growth.\n\nSOLUTION: Fixing your hormones is the first step. This means increasing your testosterone levels while lowering DHT and Estrogen levels. This will improve the size of your prostate and help reduce the risk of prostate cancer.\n\nSome medications work, such as 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or blood flow-improving ones. Unfortunately, these drugs tend to cause erectile problems. So, I would use these drugs as a last resort.\n\nHowever, there are natural ways to improve hormones and blood flow.\n\nFrequent Urination & Aging\n\nAnother cause is aging because as we get older, we produce less anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin.\n\nWhen we are younger, vasopressin is higher at night and thus, your body will help retain more water and fluids and thus, less urination at night. Unfortunately, as we get older, we produce less, and thus, we hold on to less water and hence, we urinate more often, especially at night.\n\nSOLUTION: You can take drugs that increase ADH, but I would not recommend that. They can cause kidney problems and it\u2019s not a good long-term solution.\n\nHowever, the natural way of increasing your anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) is by increasing salt intake. So one trick is to consume more salt at night, to increase vasopressin and thus, you hold on to more water and will pee less in the middle of the night.\n\nLifestyle Factors That Cause Frequent Urination\n\nFinally, there are a variety of lifestyle factors that can cause frequent urination. For example, consuming caffeinated or alcoholic beverages will increase urination.\n\nOr, just consuming more liquids too late in the day, which is a problem that I tend to have.\n\nYou also need to optimize your electrolytes and thus, increase your salt intake IF you are going to consume more liquids.\n\nHowever, another major lifestyle factor that most people don\u2019t think about is stress. This is because stress can cause more adrenal production, and higher cortisol levels, leading to negative hormonal changes.\n\nEnd result is high blood sugar which I explained earlier, causes frequent urination.\n\nStress, adrenaline and cortisol also increase blood pressure, which negatively affects your kidneys and thus, more urinary problems.\n\nStress also causes poor sleep, which REALLY messes up everything, including youth hormones such as growth hormone and testosterone. Both of which help you retain more fluid in the muscles.\n\nSOLUTION: The hardest part in life, is improving and managing your stress levels \u2013 both physically and emotionally. We have way more stress these days and we are overwhelmed with information and thus, more stress.\n\nLuckily, there are specific lifestyle changes to help manage stress levels. And, natural supplements to help promote healthy, youthful stress hormones quickly \u2013 since I know lifestyle improvements will take a lot more time and effort.\n\nIf you are urinating more often, now you know the biggest causes.\n\nMore importantly, I\u2019ve listed the solutions as well. Now it\u2019s up to you.\n\nAre you going to be the many who just listen and don\u2019t do anything?\n\nOr are you going to be the few, who take action, and make improvements by implementing just 1 or 2 of the solutions I mentioned, so you can have a healthier, longer, and happier life?\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/difference-between-testosterone-injections-and-alphaviril/",
    "content": "In 2025, I\u2019ve gotten lots and lots of questions about improving testosterone levels and thus:\n\nHaving a higher libido and sex drive\n\nMore muscle and strength\n\nLess body and belly fat\n\nBetter memory, cognition, and mental performance.\n\nEnhanced happiness, passion, and drive about life\n\n\u2026 basically, like when you were younger.\n\nThese are just some of the positive benefits of having optimal testosterone levels\u2026.\n\nThis also means, minimizing negative, \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones such as:\n\nFemale hormones (estrogen, prolactin, progesterone, etc.)\n\nStress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, norepinephrine, etc.)\n\nBalding hormones (DHT, cytokines, etc.)\n\nAnd this was the reason I formulated AlphaViril back in 1998 \u2013 to help optimize all of these hormones, so you look, feel and perform like when you were younger\u2026 And do so safely and naturally, so you don\u2019t have negative side effects.\n\nI bring all of this up because people have asked me repeatedly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between AlphaViril and taking testosterone injections\u2026 aren\u2019t they the same?\u201d\n\nAnd the answer is NOT AT ALL.\n\nTwo, completely different mechanisms, actions, and goals.\n\nExogenous Testosterone\n\nWhen you take a testosterone shot or use testosterone creams or pills, this is \u201cexogenous\u201d\u2026 which means from the OUTSIDE.\n\nWhen testosterone comes in from the outside, it signals your body to turn OFF its production of testosterone. Your body doesn\u2019t need to produce more, because you\u2019re putting it in from outside.\n\nThis causes your testicles to STOP producing testosterone and the result is:\n\nNo more testosterone is being produced by your testes\n\nNo more sperm is being produced.\n\nThus, your testicles begin to shrink in size\n\nAnd once you start with the testosterone shots, you can\u2019t stop.\n\nThis is because your testicles stopped working and it\u2019ll then take weeks and months to turn them \u201cback on\u201d. So this is a major negative.\n\nFinally, this exogenous testosterone can also now convert to OTHER, \u201cnegative\u201d hormones such as the ones I mentioned earlier:\n\nFemale hormones (estrogen, prolactin, progesterone, etc.)\n\nStress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, norepinephrine, etc.)\n\nBalding hormones (DHT, cytokines, etc.)\n\nUnless you actively BLOCK or INHIBIT the conversion to these hormones, this exogenous testosterone starts to go back down, as it converts and RAISES these other \u201cnegative, anti-testosterone\u201d hormones.\n\nThis is why steroid users \u2013 remember, testosterone is a steroid \u2013 go bald, get zits, gynecomastia (man boobs), become impotent, and so forth.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a very good endocrinology doctor like myself, who can balance out all of these hormonal conversions with other drugs.\n\nIt all becomes very complicated and expensive.\n\nEndogenous Testosterone\n\nThe other method for increasing your testosterone is endogenously, from WITHIN.\n\nThis is natural and safe. This is how AlphaViril works.\n\nThe correct combination and dosage of clinically proven herbs, minerals, vitamins, and amino acids, will signal your testicles to produce MORE testosterone \u2013 which is the opposite of the testosterone shots, which told them to STOP producing testosterone.\n\nWhen your testicles produce more testosterone, this means your testicles can actually GROW in size \u2013 rather than SHRINK as they do with the testosterone shots.\n\nYou\u2019ll have healthier sperm with better motility and mobility.\n\nYou\u2019ll actually see an INCREASE in ejaculation volume using AlphaViril! \u2026 Opposite of the testosterone shots, which decreases ejaculation volume.\n\nIn fact, a lot of porn stars use AlphaViril for this reason \u2013 for better \u201cmoney shots\u201d, in addition to bigger \u201csize\u201d and higher libido.\n\nHowever, your testosterone can still convert to the negative, \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones that I mentioned earlier.\n\nBut the good news is that AlphaViril contains natural inhibitors that will help REDUCE these negative conversions to female, stress, and balding hormones and thus, the end result is HIGHER total and free testosterone levels!\n\nBy the way, AlphaViril is the ONLY product that does all of this \u2026 it\u2019s like 5 products in 1.\n\nThis is because it\u2019s designed by ME, an anti-aging endocrinology (hormone) doctor who UNDERSTANDS all of these complex hormonal interactions and conversions.\n\n20 years ago I wanted a product like this, but unfortunately, nothing existed and thus, I had to formulate one myself.\n\nAnd to this day, STILL nothing exists because:\n\nIt\u2019s very complicated to formulate\n\nand very expensive to produce\n\nLuckily, after 20 years I\u2019ve been able to perfect the process and reduce the costs and you can take advantage of the benefits.\n\nSo, in summary, exogenous testosterone, from the outside \u2013 such as injections and creams, causes:\n\nA shutdown of testosterone and sperm production by your testicles\n\nThis causes your \u201cballs\u201d to shrink in size and sometimes, disappear completely into raisins.\n\nConversions to negative, \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones such as female, stress, and balding hormones. You\u2019ll need to take additional \u201chormone inhibitors\u201d to help fix these problems. This is expensive and unhealthy.\n\nHowever, increasing your testosterone endogenously, with a proven solution like AlphaViril, will cause an:\n\nIncrease in testosterone production\n\nHigher sperm volume and better sperm health, motility, and mobility\n\nImproved hormonal balance since AlphaViril already has \u201cnegative hormonal blocking\u201d herbs in the formula.\n\nI have no problem taking testosterone shots \u2014 IF you\u2019ve done everything the natural way FIRST. Because once you start with the shots, you can\u2019t stop. It\u2019s a lifelong commitment!\n\nAnd you better find a really smart doctor to manage and balance out all of these hormones so you can minimize the negative side effects.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/warning-dairy-milk-causes-prostate-cancer/",
    "content": "One of the favorite quotes from the 1977 docudrama called Pumping Iron, is when Arnold Schwarzenegger says, \u201cmilk is for babies when you grow up \u2013 you drink beer\u201d.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t agree with the drinking beer part and Arnold rarely drinks any alcohol himself.\n\nHowever, as stated in my previous articles, I don\u2019t think you should have dairy \u2013 thus, no milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, etc.\n\nOr, IF you do \u2013 you should consume very small amounts of raw, unpasteurized, unprocessed, full-fat dairy from grass-fed animals, who have never taken any hormones or antibiotics.\n\nThis pretty much eliminates 99% of ALL dairy that most of you consume.\n\nIf you want to live a long, happy, and healthy life \u2013 try to do things as naturally as possible.\n\nAnd I believe that consuming milk and dairy products is unnatural.\n\nNot only are humans the only species that consumes milk in adulthood, but they are also the only ones to drink the milk of other animals.\n\nBiologically, cow\u2019s milk is meant to feed a rapidly growing calf. Humans aren\u2019t calves \u2014 and adults usually don\u2019t need to grow.\n\nThis is the same for a human mother\u2019s milk \u2013 it\u2019s designed for rapid growth, during a time when a baby can correctly convert the milk into specific nutrients for growth. The milk also consists of hormones, growth factors, and peptides.\n\nIn fact, before the agricultural revolution, humans only drank mothers\u2019 milk as infants. They didn\u2019t consume dairy as adults.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, dairy isn\u2019t necessary for optimal health, and in my opinion, it\u2019s actually BAD for your health.\n\nIt\u2019s Linked To Serious Prostate Problems\n\nOne major reason to NOT consume dairy is that it\u2019s linked to prostate problems. Granted, there are many studies that are inconclusive. However, when digging deeper \u2013 these studies are many times funded by the dairy industry.\n\nIn fact, The China Study, a book written by doctors Colin and Thomas Cambell, revealed that animal protein and more specifically, dairy \u2014 increased the growth of cancer cells.2\n\nThis was a massive study with lots of evidence showing the commonalities between people who have prostate problems and those who don\u2019t.\n\nIn regards to today\u2019s specific topic of prostate problems\u2013 most large studies clearly show that high dairy consumption increases the risk of prostate problems.\n\nThere\u2019s even one study that shows that having lots of dairy early in life, increases the risk of advanced prostate problems later in life.6\n\nSo the sooner you stop, the better.\n\nWhy Does Dairy Cause Prostate Problems?\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated many times in the past, genetics aside \u2013 the way you look and feel, IS determined by your HORMONES and the optimal balance of hormones, chemicals, enzymes, and neurotransmitters.\n\nAn unnatural food, such as dairy, which is processed and contains toxins, bad hormones, and antibiotics, will cause negative changes in your hormones.\n\nA major one is an increase in estrogen \u2013 known as the primary cause of both breast and prostate problems.\n\nFor men, this increase in estrogen also decreases testosterone \u2013 the YOUTH hormone!\n\nI\u2019ll be very honest with you \u2013 there are so many factors that can cause prostate problems.\n\nHowever, IF you have a family history of it, IF you\u2019re over the age of 40, and certainly, IF you\u2019re a man concerned about prostate health and improving your testosterone levels \u2013 my suggestion is to eliminate all dairy.\n\nIf you want to improve hormonal balance to their optimal, youthful levels\u2026 while naturally decreasing estrogen and increasing testosterone levels, make sure you click this special link.\n\nIt\u2019s a 20+ year proven formula with scientifically proven data that shows it works it\u2019s safe and it can lead to a healthier prostate!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524299/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_China_Study\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527754\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16333032\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15203374\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22190107",

    "content": "If you\u2019re dealing with low sex drive and having any erectile dysfunction\u2026 such as getting an erection or maintaining one during sex \u2013 the primary reason is due to hormonal imbalances.\n\nTypically you have low testosterone, high female, and stress hormones.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve mentioned this in the past\u2026\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also a secondary reason for erectile dysfunction that can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be ignored and that has to do with poor blood flow and circulation \u2013 throughout your body, but more specifically to your penis.\n\nBTW, this also affects women to a smaller degree by reducing blood flow to their clitoris.\n\nIn fact, I want you to quickly watch this short 30-second clip from Dr. David Perlmutter and Dr. Daniel Amen:\n\nSo there are two things I want to point out based on what was stated in the video clip:\n\nThe Harvard study1 points out at the primary non-hormonal reason for erectile dysfunction is \u201cthe most common cause is the inadequate blood supply to the spongy tissues in the penis that provide rigidity\u201d.\n\nOf course, poor blood flow also reduces the size and firmness of your penis.\n\nThe second thing I want to point out is how Dr. Amen stated that \u201cit means you have bad habits\u201d.\n\nBy this, he means that most people are \u201cunknowingly\u201d making the wrong lifestyle choices every day and thus, the \u201cbad habits\u201d.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I quickly want to discuss today \u2013 3 clinically proven and simple changes you can make right away, that\u2019ll naturally improve your blood flow and circulation and thus, not only improve your erections \u2014 but also improve your health and entire vascular system \u2026 which of course, affects your muscles, heart, and brain.\n\n3 Proven Ways To Improve Blood Flow and Fix Erectile Dysfunction\n\nDiet can play a big role in improving your heart health and reducing your risk for a buildup of plaque. It\u2019s never too late to eat a healthier diet. Just as years of bad eating can damage your body, good eating can help heal it and it can happen quickly.\n\nAdd more \u201chealthy\u201d fats to your diet. These are typically mono and polyunsaturated fats. They\u2019re found in foods like olives, raw seeds, nuts, avocados, and fish. These should be RAW and uncooked.\n\nEliminate \u201cunhealthy\u201d and artificial sources of trans fats. Most artificial trans fats are found in processed, packaged foods like cookies and snack cakes. These have been heated and are hydrogenated. They are also high in omega-6 fats, which cause inflammation.\n\nIncrease your fiber intake. Soluble fiber helps prevent and remove plaque buildup. You can find soluble fiber in foods like vegetables, lentils, beans, and oats. I would also add fiber supplements as well, especially if you have a hard time getting it all from food.\n\nCut back on sugar. The sugar found in processed foods like cookies, ice cream, and sugar-sweetened beverages has no nutritional value. Unfortunately, sugar is hidden in almost all \u201cman-made\u201d foods. They increase your blood sugar levels\u2026 Which when combined with unhealthy fats, clogs your arteries.\n\nFirst, we all need to move more. All we tend to do is sit all day long \u2014 computer, phone, driving, eating, work, etc.\n\nThe reason exercise is important is because it helps improve your youth hormones, which then helps your body naturally get rid of toxins \u2013 including plaque.\n\nAnd in my opinion, \u201cresistance exercise\u201d is more important than cardiovascular. This means lifting weights \u2013 which can be with free weights, machines, cables, or simply your own body weight.\n\nAnd if you workout quickly, it will also give you a very strong cardiovascular workout at the same time.\n\nYou only need 3x weekly, and I would also add daily walking.\n\nTaking specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals that are clinically proven to help improve blood flow and circulation, will give you the biggest and fastest improvements in preventing AND removing plaque buildup.\n\nOf course, supplements do NOT take the place of a healthy lifestyle.\n\nHowever, when combined together, it\u2019s like being on \u201csteroids\u201d. You\u2019ll get much faster and more dramatic results, with LESS effort.\n\nAnd for many people, like my own parents, it made the biggest difference in REMOVING the plaque buildup \u2014 more so than preventing it.\n\nIf you want to finally fix your ED problems and dramatically improve your sex drive, make sure you improve your hormones, and don\u2019t forget to ALSO improve your blood flow.\n\nYour heart, mind, AND penis will thank you!\n\nSo make sure you eat better, exercise, and take specific supplements.\n\nMake small improvements daily and within a few weeks and months, you\u2019ll see and feel dramatic improvements.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/not-satisfied-with-your-sex-life https://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/discover-health\n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/not-satisfied-with-your-sex-life\n\nhttps://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/discover-health",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/myth-testosterone-causes-prostate-problems/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal and dispel one of the biggest myths about prostate problems \u2013 that high testosterone causes it.\n\nIn fact, the opposite is true \u2014 LOW testosterone is the REAL health risk in prostate problems.\n\nSo today you\u2019ll discover the REAL cause of prostate problems.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a man (or you KNOW of a man \u2013 brother, son, husband, etc.) over the age of 30 and certainly in your 40\u2019s and beyond, please listen carefully.\n\nThe Start Of This Myth\n\nNow, before I start with the facts, let me first tell how this entire myth first got started.\n\nAs men age, there\u2019s an increase in BPH \u2013 which stands for \u201cbenign prostatic hyperplasia\u201d. Which starts as age-associated growth of the prostate gland.\n\nThis typically causes urination problems and erectile issues.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also hormone-related BPH, which can cause prostate growth.\n\nAnd there are two simple ways doctors will test for this. Checking your PSA levels (Prostate-specific antigen) in a blood test and/or doing a prostate exam.\n\nNow, for decades scientists have given men with prostate cancer, anti-androgen drugs such as Flutamide.1,2\n\nBasically, these types of drugs are forms of \u201cmedical castration\u201d.\n\nThey completely turn OFF your testicles from producing any hormones, which are primarily testosterone for men.\n\nThe end result was a regression in prostate problems and a decrease in BPH.1,2 Unfortunately, a man is no longer a \u201cman\u201d.\n\nDepression, Impotence, Muscle Loss & More\u2026\n\nHaving no testosterone causes him to be depressed, have no sex drive, lose muscle and strength, have higher belly fat, have higher levels of cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, etc., etc.\n\nAll problems related to \u201clow testosterone\u201d. However, if you no longer have cancer, I guess these problems are okay and you\u2019ll \u201ctolerate\u201d life.\n\nUnfortunately, this thought process was and is completely wrong.\n\nHigh Testosterone & Young Men\n\nYou see, if \u201chigh testosterone\u201d was the real cause of prostate problems, then all guys in their teenage years and 20\u2019s, would have issues because this is the time when a man\u2019s testosterone is the highest.\n\nYet, guys have no prostate problems during these years \u2026 right?\n\nThe TRUTH is that as a man ages, AND his testosterone is dropping, is when he starts having prostate problems.\n\nThe REAL Cause Of Prostate Cancer\u2026\n\nRecent research reveals the cause of this is an imbalance of hormones, which is high estrogen, resulting in lowered testosterone.4\n\nAnd THIS is why taking these horrible \u201canti-androgen\u201d drugs worked.\n\nThey completely block all the testosterone in your body and thus, there was nothing to convert to estrogen and the result was yes, less testosterone\u2026 and thus, the thought process that \u201ctestosterone causes prostate problems\u201d\n\nHowever, having no testosterone also, LOWERS estrogens and THAT was the REAL reason these drugs worked.\n\nHow To Avoid & Fix Prostate Cancer\n\nIn fact, increasing your testosterone levels while also decreasing your estrogens and other \u201cnegative\u201d hormones such as DHT, prolactin, and cortisol\u2026\n\nis the REAL HELP for prostate problems!\n\nAnd that\u2019s the REAL secret \u2013 the optimal balance between these hormones.\n\nYou want the same ratio and levels of hormones that you did in your 20s when you were the HEALTHIEST!\n\nMy Family History Of Prostate Problems\n\nFor decades I\u2019ve been saying this because I have prostate problems in my family.\n\nAnd now, there are multiple studies backing everything up.\n\nIn fact, one study included 18 total studies involving almost 20,000 men and it showed that increasing testosterone helped protect against prostate problems.\n\nSummary & Bottom Line\n\nSo the bottom line is that:\n\nif you want to live a healthier and longer life\n\nif you want to decrease your risk of prostate problems\n\nand also increase your libido\u2026\n\nThen you want to actually INCREASE your testosterone levels and decrease your \u201cnegative\u201d hormones such as female (estrogens, prolactin, etc.) and stress hormones (cortisol).\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s easy to do this now and you can do it naturally. Copy the proven formula and use it for yourself\u2026\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2193461\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutamide\n\nhttp://prostate.net/articles/testosterone-prostate-cancer-link\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26779889\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11595700\n\nhttp://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838%2813%2900843-9/fulltext/a-new-era-of-testosterone-and-prostate-cancer-from-physiology-to-clinical-implications",

    "content": "So the other day I got an email from one of my YouTube subscribers asking if it\u2019s possible to make Natural Viagra at home. He wrote:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam\u2026 I just saw a video on YouTube about making natural Viagra at home using only 2 ingredients. But is this even possible or is more BS lies? Ever since I\u2019ve been watching your videos and taking your advice, my libido is much higher, my testosterone has almost doubled and my erections are a lot harder. However, I wouldn\u2019t mind getting an \u201cextra boost\u201d from home-made Viagra\u2026 know what I mean doc \ud83d\ude09 Please watch the video and let me know your thoughts\u201d\n\nSo of course, I immediately thought, \u201cyes, more lies and misinformation\u201d. But I decided to check out the video, maybe I can learn something.\n\nWhen I saw the video, I was shocked to see there were MILLIONS of views in just a few short months. So either this stuff really works or it\u2019s just some horrible scam.\n\nWell, to make a long story short and save you time, the video stated that all you needed was some watermelon and lemon juice.\n\nSadly, the video had NO audio or explanation. Just mix the two ingredients together \u2013 watermelon and lemon juice \u2013 into a 2 cup drink (16oz/1 liter) and drink it daily.\n\nUnfortunately, it gave no explanation of why/how this would work. And to me, it made no sense.\n\nWhat I Found Out About \u201cNatural Viagra\u201d?\n\nWhen I dug deeper, the video was made by some young Asian girl in China\u2026 WARNING #1.\n\nI mean, how is she ever going to know about any of this, right?\n\nI then decided to read through the hundreds of comments posted by YouTube viewers. Of course, to no surprise \u2013 everyone was pissed about how the info was fake and a waste of time.\n\nHowever, ONE person did say that the reason this *could* work is that watermelon has an amino acid called \u201cL-Citrulline\u201d, which helps improve blood flow to the penis by increasing Nitric Oxide (NO) levels. \u2026 \u201csimilar to how Viagra works\u201d.\n\nThis is partially correct\u2026.\n\nActually, the fact is that L-Citrulline converts to another amino acid called L-Arginine and that\u2019s how your body increases blood flow with higher Nitric Oxide levels.\n\nHowever, to really make this work \u2013 you\u2019d have to ingest like 5 watermelons daily to get the required 10-15 GRAMS (10,000+ milligrams) of L-Citrulline.\n\nSo, this is a major flaw with this video because nobody is going to eat this much watermelon, let alone daily.\n\nSo, that\u2019s problem #1.\n\nIt\u2019s much easier to just take L-Citrulline and Arginine in supplement powder form \u2014 which by the way, tastes like crap!!!\n\nProblem #2 that most people don\u2019t know is that when you take L-Citrulline and/or Arginine, your Prolactin levels ALSO increase.\n\nProlactin is a female hormone. It goes up after birth to produce milk to feed the baby.\n\nIn men and in women, prolactin causes:\n\nbreasts to grow (man-boobs!)\n\nit lowers testosterone\n\nand hair loss/balding \u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nAND it decreases sex drive and causes impotence!!!\n\nYes, you heard that correctly!!!\n\nInitially, it MAY increase blood flow when used at the correct higher dosage. But after the increase in Nitric Oxide and also some growth hormone, your body then does the OPPOSITE by increasing the female hormone, Prolactin. 1-3\n\nThis is why I tell people to NOT take Citrulline and Arginine unless you only do so like 2-3x weekly at the most \u2014 Or else you\u2019re going to increase your Prolactin, which lowers your testosterone, causes balding, lowers your libido, and causes impotence.\n\nObviously, this isn\u2019t what we want.\n\nSo, there you have it \u2013 another scam.\n\nNow, recently I did an article about a natural alternative to Viagra. You can read that article through the link I just gave you.\n\nMore importantly, I\u2019ve also listed a link to one of my favorite, scientifically proven solutions for naturally boosting your testosterone AND increasing your sex drive and erections.\n\nThe benefit here is that you\u2019ll never need Viagra because you\u2019ll feel and perform like you used to when you were in your late teens and early 20s because of the higher testosterone levels.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1249182\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10739497\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937800800046",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/stress-cortisol/ashwagandha-lower-stress-increase-libido/",
    "content": "Today is 2025 and I\u2019m going to quickly talk about how I use Ashwagandha Extract and how you may also want to use it for lowering your stress, cortisol and feeling more relaxed and getting better sleep.\n\nWhile at the same time, improving your testosterone levels, libido, and sexual performance.\n\nI\u2019ve done specific videos about Ashwagandha in the past \u2013 one specific for increasing testosterone and one for lowering Cortisol.\n\nHowever, today I\u2019m going to keep it short, get right to the point, and give you the quick do\u2019s and don\u2019ts and an action plan you can utilize right away about how to best use Ashwagandha extract, the correct dosages and how NOT to get ripped off.\n\nBasically, it\u2019ll be a quick summary of how you can best use Ashwagandha for BOTH increasing testosterone and lowering cortisol levels.\n\nIn fact, when I ask people \u201cwhat do you think the opposite hormone to testosterone is?\u2026\u201d, they typically say it\u2019s estrogen, the female hormone.\n\nBut no, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s the stress hormone cortisol.\n\nWhen cortisol levels increase due to excess stress \u2013 such as lack of sleep, working out too much, dieting too hard, emotional stress and so forth \u2013 your testosterone levels drop.\n\nIt\u2019s your body\u2019s way of telling you that \u201chey, something is wrong, maybe there\u2019s famine or something else\u2026 go fix the stress problem first\u2026 this is NOT the time to procreate, have sex and have babies\u201d.\n\nHence, cortisol goes up, testosterone comes down.\n\nThis is why during times of stress, your libido and sexual performance plummet.\n\nAnd this is where Ashwagandha EXTRACT comes in because it helps lower excess stress hormones such as cortisol, which will then indirectly increase testosterone levels and all of the benefits that come with having optimal testosterone, cortisol and hormonal balance.\n\nDo NOT Use These Forms Of Ashwagandha\n\nFirst, I don\u2019t like the liquid versions at all \u2013 they are weak and can go rancid quickly. So, I suggest the pill versions.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re going to use Ashwagandha in pill form, the first thing is you NEVER want to use Ashwagandha root powder. You only want to use the extract.\n\nAnd this is because the extract contains numerous bioactive compounds, namely alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, steroids, and steroidal lactones. These compounds produce all the benefits.\n\nSo, make sure you read the labels.\n\nFor example, look at these two labels \u2013 it shows no extract:\n\nSo, make sure the label shows an extra %.\n\nThe higher the extract, the more potent the Ashwagandha.\n\nBasically, you\u2019re paying for the extract and the ideal, standardized extract should be 7%-10% withanolide glycoside conjugates\n\nNow, look how low these two labels show:\n\nFirst one is not even half of 1%. I just said use 10%. So, you\u2019ll need at least 20x the dose of this brand because the extra % is so low.\n\nNow, second label is better at 2.5% versus only .2% or .5% in the previous product. But again, you\u2019ll need at least 4x the dose.\n\nBasically, even though you pay a little less for one of these inferior products, you\u2019ll have to take 4-20x the dose to get the same benefits of the 10% extract.\n\nI mention all of this so you don\u2019t get ripped off and waste your valuable money like I used when I first started out.\n\nBest Forms Of Ashwagandha\n\nNow, there are two popular and potent, clinically researched versions of Ashwagandha.\n\nI\u2019ve used both of them separately and together. Both are also being utilized in two products that I use daily, and I\u2019ll mention both of them in a minute.\n\nThe reason I like these two specific ashwagandhas \u2013 KSM-66 and Sensoril \u2013 is because of the numerous human, clinical studies and the standardized dosages and extracts.\n\nWhen you purchase a product with either of these two versions \u2013 KSM-66 and/or Sensoril \u2013 you\u2019re guaranteed a product that works. It\u2019s been standardized.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to get ripped off with the low % extract or low mg dose, which renders the product ineffective and a waste of time and money.\n\nDifference Between KSM-66 & Sensoril\n\nBut now we want to know, what\u2019s the difference between KSM-66 and Sensoril and which is better?\n\nThis has a more uplifting effect. More energetic. It helps reduce feelings of fatigue.\n\nIt\u2019s used more by fitness people because research has shown that it can promote an increase in:\n\ntestosterone levels by 17%\n\nLuteinizing hormone (LH) by 34% \u2013 this signals your testes to produce more testosterone.\n\nAnd improved sperm motility by 57%\n\nSensoril Ashwagandha:\n\nThis has a more calming effect. More relaxed feeling because it supports GABA and serotonin properties.\n\nIt\u2019s better for anti-stress, and cortisol-lowering effects.\n\nNow, for clarity, I\u2019m not saying these versions do EITHER/OR \u2013 they do both, just one does more energy and one does more relaxing.\n\nSo, it\u2019s ideally best to use KSM-66 more during the day because it increases energy levels more. While using Sensoril more in the evening and before sleep, because of the calming effects.\n\nSo, I personally use AlphaViril during the day \u2013 because it contains KSM-66 Ashwagandha, in addition to numerous herbs, vitamins and minerals which help boost testosterone and libido.\n\nThen in the late evening, I use Stress & Cortisol Relief because it contains Sensoril Ashwagandha, combined with numerous ingredients for supporting healthy cortisol levels and adrenal function.

    "content": "When you cut down on calories, your testosterone levels may decrease.\n\nStress is one of the major causes of low testosterone, as it leads to an increase in cortisol levels and a decrease in testosterone levels.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not getting enough sleep, it can also contribute to elevated cortisol levels and lower T levels.\n\nBut here\u2019s some good news! You can keep your hormones steady while on a calorie deficit or in stressful periods with certain dietary and supplement options.\n\nFor example, reducing the levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is important to raise free testosterone levels. You can achieve this by reducing elevated estrogen levels through weight loss. You can also try natural supplements like DIM and white button mushroom extract to manage estrogen levels.\n\nCertain herbs such as Tongkat Ali, Ashwagandha, Tribulus Terrestris, Maca root, Nettle extract, and Horny Goat Weed can help increase free testosterone levels. You can find all these herbs in Alphaviril, my favorite testosterone-boosting supplement.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking to lower cortisol levels and decrease stress hormones, it\u2019s important to get more sleep and consume more healthy carbohydrates.\n\nSupplements such as vitamin C, fish oil, magnesium, ashwagandha, and phosphatidylserine can help manage cortisol levels and stress hormones. Stress & Cortisol Relief contains all these herbs in clinically proven forms and dosages.\n\nTo summarize, during the times of diet and stress, try balancing hormones naturally.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and having healthy testosterone levels is important for BOTH men & women. Testosterone is needed for\n\nToday\u2019s topic discusses whether exercise increases or decreases testosterone levels?\u2026.\n\nI got an email from Jeremy and he asks:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super confused about working out and exercise\u2026 does it increase or decrease testosterone levels? I\u2019ve read mixed information and I think I\u2019m doing something wrong because I\u2019m not gaining any muscle, my belly looks fatter and worst of all, my sex drive is worse and it\u2019s causing problems with my girlfriend.\n\nI\u2019ve watched so many of your videos and I\u2019ve applied your advice. I\u2019ve gotten great results with my health. However, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever answers this topic \u2013 Please help me Dr. Sam\u201d\n\nActually, I have addressed this question in the past, but not in detail or directly and that\u2019s why I\u2019m bringing this up today.\n\nAnd the truth is that I get a lot of questions about this topic, so don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re alone Jeremy.\n\nIt\u2019s such an important topic because most people ARE doing all the wrong things when it comes to exercise.\n\nAnd I say this because I personally wasted at least 10 years of my life doing all the wrong things, reading lies in the magazines (this was before the internet) and thus, never making any real progress and worse of all, causing more harm to my body and health.\n\nExercises Increase Or Decrease Your Testosterone Levels!\n\nSo the fact is that exercise can increase OR decrease your testosterone levels.\n\nIt all depends on what you do, when, where, how often, and for how long.\n\nAnd thus, you can gain OR lose muscle.\n\nDecrease OR increase belly fat.\n\nGain OR lose strength.\n\nIncrease OR decrease your energy levels.\n\nImprove or decline the immune system.\n\nAnd you can increase or decrease your sex drive, libido and happiness.\n\nMy Personal Struggles\n\nSo let me tell you about myself\u2026\n\nWhen I was younger, I would exercise 5-6x weekly.\n\nI would work out for at least an hour. I would lift heavy weights, I\u2019d push hard, and go to \u201cfailure\u201d on all my exercises.\n\nI would also do cardio almost daily \u2013 for at least 30 minutes or more. Typically it was the bike, jogging, stairmaster, etc.\n\nIt was a hard workout and I would always leave the gym feeling exhausted.\n\nHowever, I felt like I had a good, \u201chonest\u201d workout because I gave it my all and pushed as much as I can.\n\nI did this for years\u2026\n\nThe end result \u2013 sadly, I looked the same all the time!\u2026\n\nI always seemed like I had a cold and I\u2019d get sick often.\n\nI never had any energy to do much else \u2014 I was just tired from my workouts.\n\nThe end result is I looked \u201cskinny-fat\u201d.\n\nYou know, not muscular or \u201clean\u201d. It just didn\u2019t look good. I was \u201cpuffy\u201d and \u201csquishy\u201d all the time.\n\nAnd sadly, my sex drive was kinda \u201cblah\u201d. Granted, because I was YOUNG, it was still \u201cokay\u201d.\n\nHowever, compared to my friends \u2013 it was much lower.\n\nThen one day I decided to do a hormone test because I was just curious.\n\nMy doctor was reluctant and he said \u201cwhy to bother, you\u2019re young\u2026 your hormones are fine\u201d\n\nWell, guess what \u2014 my testosterone levels were low. It was still in the \u201cnormal\u201d range, but near the bottom/low end.\n\nWorst of all, my \u201cnegative\u201d hormones were \u201chigh\u201d\u2026such as my female hormone, estrogen\n\nAnd my stress hormone, Cortisol.\n\nThus, my hormones were not good, not optimal \u2014 definitely not for a 23-year-old man.\n\n\u2026When things should have been much better and I should have had super high testosterone levels.\n\nI mean, I was young and this was as good as it was going to get and it SUCKED!!!\n\nIt\u2019s All About The RIGHT Hormones!\n\nTo make a long story short, I realized then that without the right hormones \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter what you do, how much you exercise, or what you eat \u2014 you\u2019re screwed!\n\nThis is why steroids are so powerful. They give you \u201coptimal\u201d levels.\n\nHowever, you can make your own\u201cnatural steroids\u201d from within, and not have any of the negative side effects\u2026\n\nIF you know what to do and more importantly, what NOT to do.\n\nSo what does all of this have to do with the original topic of \u201cexercise and increasing or decreasing your testosterone levels\u201d?\u2026\n\nHere are the basic \u201cshort cuts\u201d on the \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d\n\nLift weights! It increases your testosterone levels\n\nKeep your workouts short, 45 minutes or less. Anything over an hour and your testosterone drops and your stress hormone, cortisol goes up.\n\nWorkout no more than 4x weekly. Ideally, it would be every other day. The rest days keep your cortisol levels lower.\n\nDo one workout with heavier weights and lower reps \u2013 about 8-10 repetitions. And the next workout is higher, about 12-15 reps. Lower reps improve testosterone and higher reps improve Growth Hormone. They work together.\n\nOne week out of every month, reduce your sets and have easier workouts. This again prevents your cortisol levels from going too high.\n\nEliminate or limit stressful cardio. This means no running, jogging, biking, etc. These all decrease your testosterone and increase stress hormones. Much better to go for a fast walk, outside \u2013 greatly reduces stress hormones and boosts testosterone.\n\nDon\u2019t kill yourself every workout, go to failure, push hard, etc. When you are \u201cnatural\u201d and have \u201cregular\u201d genetics, you can\u2019t push so much, so often\u2026 or else your testosterone drops because your body is under \u201cstress\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Opposite Of Testosterone?\n\nWhen I ask most people \u201cwhat\u2019s the opposite of testosterone\u201d, people typically reply back with \u201cestrogen\u201d, the female hormone.\n\nHowever, this is not true.\n\nWe all have the same hormones but in different ratios and amounts.\n\nActually, the opposite of testosterone is the stress hormone, cortisol.\n\nThis is why I keep bringing up ways to NOT increase your cortisol because as that goes higher, your testosterone goes lower.\n\nCortisol does the opposite of testosterone.\n\nIt decreases muscle and strength, increases belly fat, makes you tired, and kills your sex drive.\n\nAgain, \u201cstress\u201d is bad and the wrong workouts will cause stress on your body.\n\nAnyway, this is a brief introduction to hormones and how exercise affects them.\n\nTestosterone is one of the important ones. However, there are other hormones that when optimized, will allow you to build lots of muscle, get ripped abs, and dramatically improve your libido and \u201cdrive\u201d.\n\nSo if you want to improve this part of your life and get faster results and save yourself valuable time and money, check this link.\n\nYou\u2019ll discover how to naturally and quickly improve your hormones.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/does-testosterone-cause-acne-how-to-prevent-it/",
    "content": "The primary cause of how testosterone can cause acne\n\nSecondary causes of acne\n\nAnd of course, how to reduce and even stop acne.\n\nTestosterone typically converts to 2 main hormones:\n\nDHT (Dihydrotestosterone) -is linked to hair loss, body hair growth, prostate problems, and yes \u2013 pimples\n\nEstrogen \u2013 which can cause extra body fat, moodiness, man-boobs (gynecomastia) and yes, also pimples.\n\nDHT can cause pimples directly because it binds much more strongly than testosterone to the androgen receptors. Estrogen can cause pimples indirectly by increasing the sensitivity of the androgen receptor.\n\nThis basically means that when it comes to acne, high DHT can cause it and high estrogen increases it.\n\nAdditionally, if your hormones suddenly fluctuate up or down \u2013 such as during puberty, taking testosterone injections or steroids\u2026 or even when women are menstruating \u2013 then your body will dramatically increase sebum production, you\u2019ll get oily skin and that can cause more acne.\n\nThis is why older women can still get acne every month due to the fluctuations in their hormones due to their menstrual cycle.\n\nOr if you have a lot of acute stress, the sudden changes in your hormones can cause acne.\n\nPlease keep in mind that there are other factors that can contribute to excess acne.\n\nClogged Pores: if your skin isn\u2019t clean, your pores can get clogged, bacteria grow and you\u2019ll get pimples. Typical places are chest, back, and face.\n\nDiet: Another factor is of course your diet. For many people, dairy can cause acne. Any food that causes inflammation can increase acne. So, processed foods, seed oils, high glycemic and sugary foods, and so forth can all cause more inflammation, and changes in your hormones \u2013 such as insulin and cortisol \u2013 all of which can cause acne.\n\nStress: Of course, stress can negatively affect anything in your body, which can cause an increase in stress hormones, poor sleep, inflammation, and so forth.\n\nGenetics: Lastly, genetics always has a big impact on your body. Thus, if you\u2019re more genetically predisposed to getting acne\u2026 For example, when you were going through puberty you had a lot more than other people\u2026 Then you need to put in more effort at improving your diet, managing stress, and keeping your skin clean\u2026 thus, optimizing your hormones.\n\nHow About Testosterone?\n\nNow, circling back to testosterone. You CAN have higher testosterone levels, and still reduce getting acne.\n\nOne simple way is to reduce excess DHT levels. You can take 5 Alpha Reductase drugs such as Finasteride or Dutasteride. Herbs such as Saw Palmetto extract can also work. But, these solutions can reduce your sex drive in some people.\n\nAlso, reducing excess estrogen levels is a good idea. Again, this can be done with potent aromatase-inhibiting drugs such as Arimidex, Femara or Aromasin. Unfortunately, these will also cause a ton of side effects and lowered libido is one.\n\nSupplements such as DIM, and White Button Mushroom Extract can help optimize your estrogen levels.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there\u2019s a potent mineral that not only helps reduce DHT and estrogen but can also increase testosterone levels and that\u2019s Zinc. I suggest you take it with copper to prevent imbalances.\n\n15-30 mg of zinc with 1-2 mg of copper daily is a good start. I\u2019ve done an entire video about this.\n\nNow, there are other safe and natural ways to help balance out your testosterone, DHT, and estrogen levels. There are other herbs and minerals. Some of the best and most scientifically researched ones are found in AlphaViril. This is an all-in-one pill I\u2019ve been taking for over 20 years.\n\nAlphaViril does contain all the correct herbs, at the proper dosage and extracts, including both Zinc and Copper.\n\nTestosterone directly does not cause acne.\n\nWhat testosterone converts to, DHT and estrogen, are the real causes of acne.\n\nHormonal fluctuations make things worse. So you need to make sure your diet and stress levels are managed properly.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re just genetically prone to getting acne, then you really need to focus on all the solutions I\u2019ve mentioned today and start taking AlphaViril to speed up the results.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

However, did you know that sitting to pee can actually be good for your health?\n\nYup, sitting to pee is good for your prostate and it\u2019s also less messy.\n\nThis is especially important if you\u2019re over the age of 45 or 50 and are starting to have some prostate growth\u2026\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re going to a public bathroom\u2026 It\u2019s just best to stand and pee.\n\nHowever, when you\u2019re at home or in a private bathroom, you may consider taking a little break and sitting when you pee.\n\nIn fact, a global study showed that 40% of German men always sit to pee and 22% do so \u201cmost\u201d of the time.\n\nAbout 25% of Sweden and Australian men also always sit to pee.\n\nIn a 2020 study, almost 70% of Japanese men said they sit to pee.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Better To Sit Down To Pee\n\nAnyway, there are clinical benefits to sitting when peeing and it\u2019s more specifically having to do with prostate and bladder health.\n\nWhen you sit down to pee, you\u2019re able to empty your bladder faster and more effectively. You\u2019ll actually use your abdominal muscles more to get those last few squirts out and you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve emptied the bladder better.\n\nOn the other hand, when you stand to pee, you activate muscles in your pelvis and spine to help you stand\u2026 so things are a little more tense around your bladder area and it\u2019s not as easy as sitting.\n\nHowever, when you sit, everything is completely relaxed, and thus, urinating is easier and faster.\n\nLastly, when you sit, the aim is better and you\u2019re not going to get pee all over the place. Something your girlfriend or wife would definitely be appreciative of.\n\nThis is especially true in the middle of the night when you\u2019re sleeping and have to get up to pee and you don\u2019t want to turn on the lights.\n\nThis is the time I always sit to pee. It\u2019s just easier, faster and cleaner.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re concerned about prostate health, I have lots of great resources and videos for you.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/boost-testosterone/this-probiotic-increases-testosterone-testicle-size/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and a little while ago I made a video about a special drink that can cause your testicles to grow and also increases testosterone levels.\n\nNeedless to say, that video became very popular with over a couple of million views, and led to many questions and this video is a follow-up to that original video.\n\nBasically, there\u2019s a special probiotic strain called L reuteri (rooh-tehr-i). It\u2019s been shown to potentially help increase testosterone levels, testicular size and also produce more sperm.\n\nIt\u2019s found primarily in mothers\u2019 milk and fermented foods.\n\nYou can also purchase it as a stand-alone probiotic in capsule or powder form.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to reveal the 4 best foods for maximizing the L reuteri probiotic and most importantly, other healthy probiotics.\n\nPlus, an even better and faster way to increase your testosterone levels if that\u2019s your goal\u2026 which you can use in combination with the L reuteri probiotic.\n\nProbiotic For Testicle Size\n\nFirst, it\u2019s too late for mothers\u2019 milk, sorry guys.\n\nSecond, taking L reuteri in a supplement form such as a pill or powder is fine, but because it\u2019s a probiotic, it\u2019s very heat sensitive. Most of the time, it\u2019ll be dead by the time you take it. Or not nearly as effective.\n\nThen there is the dosage\u2026 Should you take 100 million, 2 billion, 70 billion or more?\n\nOf course, most people will think \u201cThe more the merrier. The higher the dose, the better the results\u201d\u2026 right?\n\nWell, the truth is that probiotics are basically healthy bacteria. Your body has millions, billions, and trillions of them. And trust me, they are NEVER in isolation.\n\nThus, it\u2019s best to consume probiotics in a more natural form, along with lots of other naturally occurring and different strains of probiotics.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m not a fan of taking any single probiotic by itself.\n\nAnd the best way to get your probiotics, including L reuteri (rooh-tehr-i), is by eating fermented foods.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a much higher dosage and variations, at a cheaper price.\n\nSo let me quickly list the top fermented foods and the last one will be my favorite and what I consider, the best one.\n\nThe first and most popular one is yogurt. Unfortunately, most yogurt can actually cause gut problems for many adults.\n\nThe type of milk, more specifically the cow milk found in the united states, can actually be inflammatory for most people.\n\nDairy can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea or constipation, and for most adults, gas and flatulence.\n\nBut Greek yogurt is better than regular yogurt. And yogurt made from Goat\u2019s milk is even better.\n\nMost can tolerate Greek yogurt and Goat\u2019s Milk yogurt, without getting gassy.\n\nAs much as I like the taste of yogurt, unfortunately, it can cause gas and bloating for me because I don\u2019t do well with yogurt. Maybe you do \u2026\n\nThen there\u2019s Kefir (keh-fear), which I went into detail in my original video.\n\nKefir is a fermented milk drink that is made by adding kefir grains to milk. Kefir grains are not actual grains but rather a combination of bacteria and yeast that form a symbiotic culture. These grains are added to milk, typically cow\u2019s milk or goat\u2019s milk, and left to ferment for a period of time, usually around 24 to 48 hours.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not a fan of dairy. Nor do I like yeast because it can cause or increase candida in some people.\n\nPlus, Kefir can get expensive. However, you may want to give it a try and see how you like the taste of it.\n\nKimchi is a traditional Korean fermented side dish made from vegetables, most commonly cabbage, and a variety of seasonings.\n\nThe fermentation process of kimchi helps promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, similar to other fermented foods.\n\nKimchi is a bit harder to find than other fermented foods. But if you can find it and like the taste of it, then enjoy eating it.\n\nFinally, we have what I think is the best one, or at least my favorite, which is Sauerkraut.\n\nSauerkraut is a fermented cabbage. It is made by finely shredding cabbage and fermenting it with lactic acid bacteria.\n\nWhat I like most about it is that it\u2019s not dairy. You can get it at any grocery store. Plus, you can even make it at home.\n\nIt also tends to have a higher probiotic count than other foods I mentioned today.\n\nSo, if you like the taste sauerkraut, it\u2019s the best option in my opinion.\n\nOne thing to know is that not all sauerkraut is properly made and thus, has all the healthy bacteria and probiotics. Unfortunately, the label won\u2019t tell you either.\n\nSo, when buying sauerkraut, make sure it\u2019s refrigerated. If it\u2019s not, most likely it will lack healthy bacteria.\n\nAlso, make sure to drink the liquid brine and not just eat the sauerkraut cabbage. The liquid brine actually has the most amount of healthy probiotic bacteria\n\n\u2026 so there you have it, the top best-fermented foods to maximize your probiotics, including L reuteri (roh-tehr-i)\n\nNow, is there any guarantee that your testicles will grow and your testosterone will increase by eating these fermented foods because of the L reuteri (roh-tehr-i)?\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.\n\nBut these foods have so many other health benefits, that I highly suggest you try eating at least one of them a few times a week and preferably a variation of at least 2 or 3 of them for additional probiotic benefits and gut health.\n\nLastly, if you really want a faster and easier way to increase your testosterone levels, make sure you check the solution I\u2019ve been using myself for over 20 years!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "7 Things Men Should Know About Vaginas In 2025",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/7-things-men-should-know-about-vaginas/",
    "content": "A little while ago, I made a popular video called, \u201c10 Fascinating Facts About The Penis You Did NOT Know\u201d. And, to my surprise, it got a ton of views.\n\nHowever, I didn\u2019t want to leave out or forget all about the vagina. And, based on the questions and comments from the guys, I decided to make today\u2019s video about \u201c7 things men should know about the vagina\u201d in 2025.\n\nSo guys, sit back and listen carefully\u2026\n\nWomen Get Erections Too\n\nSo obviously, when a man gets aroused, extra blood flows to the penis, it swells and grows in size and hence, an erection.\n\nWell, the same thing happens to a woman.\n\nMore specifically, extra blood flows to her clitoris and yes, the clitoris also expands and grows in size. And yes, it also gets erect.\n\nAnd just like the penis, the clitoris at this time becomes extra sensitive, just like the head of your penis.\n\nJust know that if you try to stimulate the clitoris too much, too hard, or too fast\u2026 it can become overly sensitive and may retract back underneath the hood to avoid further stimulation.\n\nThus, you need to take your time and most importantly, listen to \u2026 or watch for \u2026 or feel for \u2026 specific clues she will express based on her words or body language, letting you know when to do more or when to back off.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s about HER pleasure, not yours when you\u2019re trying to arouse and please her.\n\nBy the way, guys, IF you\u2019re not able to get a hard erection and/or maintain it, make sure you check more articles for proven solutions for better blood flow & harder, fuller erections.\n\nAnd yes, the \u201cblood flow\u201d solutions will also work for women as well.\n\nGetting Wet, Is She Into You or Not?\n\nMost people will say or assume that when a guy gets an erection, he must be \u201cturned on\u201d by his partner. Yes, this is mostly true.\n\nGranted, if the guy is having hormonal or blood flow problems, then he may not be able to get an erection, even though he is turned on. He can be very aroused mentally and emotionally, but things aren\u2019t working correctly due to hormones or stress, or something similar.\n\nNow, when it comes to women, most guys will think or assume that if she isn\u2019t \u201cwet\u201d or lubricated, she isn\u2019t turned on or aroused.\n\nBut, this also isn\u2019t necessarily true.\n\nAgain, age, stress, hormones, menstrual cycles, and so forth all play a key role in her ability to produce lubrication.\n\nFor example, women may have a harder time lubricating naturally after menstruation. Certain medications and antihistamines also make lubrication more difficult, as do changes in hormones, birth control, age, stress, alcohol, or other drugs.\n\nAlso, just like guys, the longer you\u2019re in a relationship with someone, the longer it may take you to get aroused or in a woman\u2019s case, get wet and lubricated.\n\nAgain, this has to do with hormones and neurotransmitters.\n\nFor example, when you first meet someone, your dopamine and testosterone levels shoot up, in addition to other hormonal changes. These factors allow you to get aroused quickly.\n\nEither way, the point here is to be patient and if she\u2019s not super wet, don\u2019t take it personally. It may have nothing to do with you.\n\nJust make sure you use some form of lubrication, such as your saliva.\n\nClitoris Is Twice As Sensitive\n\nEarlier I mentioned how a woman\u2019s clitoris grows just like the penis. In fact, in many ways, the clitoris is just like a penis \u2026 at least when it comes to sex.\n\nAnd just as the head of the penis is the most sensitive, so is the same with the head of the clitoris.\n\nHere\u2019s something you may not know \u2013 the clitoris serves one purpose and one purpose only: to make a woman feel good.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s the only human organ that exists solely for pleasure.\n\nAnd because of this, it\u2019s estimated that the clitoris has about 8000 pleasure sensory nerve endings. While the head of the penis has about 4,000 nerves. Thus, women can feel twice the pleasure \u2013 and that\u2019s just with their clitoris.\n\nThe point here is that make sure if you want to satisfy your woman, you give extra attention to her clitoris. Take your time, be gentle, and get creative.\n\nMore importantly, when in doubt \u2013 just ask her what he likes.\n\nRemember, your only goal is to satisfy her \u2013 and she knows better than you do, what she really wants, likes, and responds to.\n\nYour Scrotum & Her Labia\n\nIn addition to the penis, as an area of sexual pleasure, is also the guy\u2019s testicles.\n\nBasically, the scrotum and the surrounding areas are also very erogenous. Lots of pleasure sensory nerves.\n\nSomething you may not know is that the clitoris develops from the same area of an embryo (called the genital tabernacle) as a man\u2019s penis.\n\nNow, in this same area in the embryo, where the scrotum develops in men, the labia majora develops in females.\n\nThus, the surrounding areas and skin of the vagina should also be stimulated gently with the fingers, mouth, and tongue.\n\nWhen it comes to pleasure, the penis is like the clitoris. And the scrotum is like the labia.\n\nOrgasms Through Intercourse\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve mentioned how sensitive a woman\u2019s clitoris, labia, and this entire outer and surrounding area are.\n\nYET, most guys just want to have intercourse and expect a woman to orgasm.\n\nBad move guys, unless you\u2019re very selfish.\n\nStudies show that 75% of women NEVER achieve orgasms from intercourse alone.\n\nThus, foreplay and external stimulation can be far more important than penetration, when it comes to women achieving orgasms.\n\nMy suggestion is you first stimulate her mind \u2013 that can be with words, anticipation, compliments, and so forth. This starts foreplay\u2026\n\nThen stimulate her body by kissing her lips, neck, breasts, and so forth.\n\nAs she gets more aroused emotionally, gently stimulate the OUTSIDE of her vagina \u2014 her labia, clitoris, and so forth.\n\nThen gently insert a finger or two inside her vagina, while also stimulating her clitoris. Pay attention to the clues she\u2019s giving you \u2013 her words, sounds, body language, and so forth.\n\nFINALLY, when he is just grinding you and basically begging, THEN you can then penetrate her. At this point, if she hasn\u2019t already orgasmed, she will as she\u2019s ready.\n\nRemember, women take time and need more stimulation. Be patient. Ask questions, listen, be attentive, curious, and give.\n\nSex, just like a good relationship, is a place to give, not take.\n\nSpeaking of orgasms through intercourse, what about the infamous G-spot? Some say it exits and some say it doesn\u2019t.\n\nExperts have said the G-spot is an area in the vagina that can give a woman the most pleasure, even more so than clitoral stimulation.\n\nPersonally, I can assure you that the G-spot does exist.\n\nFinding it is another story and she also needs to know her body well.\n\nIf done correctly, not only can you give her an intense orgasm through her g-spot, but you can also make her squirt or what\u2019s called, \u201cfemale ejaculation\u201d.\n\nAs stated at the beginning of this video, guys are a bit obsessed about their penis, especially the size of it.\n\nI have an entire video series about how to grow your penis.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the vaginal canal can change in size. It\u2019s usually 3-6 inches long (7.5-15 cm). But the elastic tissue has the ability to expand by 200% and thus, take 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) of penis size.\n\nWhat\u2019s also interesting is that the vagina can also snap back like a rubber band. So, it won\u2019t stretch out permanently.\n\nHowever, multiple births or aging, or changes in hormones might cause the vagina\u2019s muscular elasticity to weaken. But the good news is that Kegel exercises can help.\n\nIn fact, Kegel exercises can also help a man get better and have harder erections.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve given some things for you guys to think about. I suggest you watch and listen to this video again, and maybe take notes.\n\nShare it with one of your buddies. Or, your lady and ask her what she thinks about it.\n\nIn fact, ask if she\u2019s gotta any suggestions for me to add to part two of this video because there are a few other interesting facts I\u2019m saving for later to release in a future video.\n\nAlso, do me a favor and let me know what you learned today or what you want me to cover in a future video.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re subscribed and click the notification icon so when future videos are released, you\u2019ll be notified and you won\u2019t miss out.\n\nLastly, visit the important links below this video, in the description area, for the topics I mentioned earlier \u2013 such as:\n\nIncreasing testosterone levels\n\nPenis growth video & tutorial\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "First off, if you watch porn, don\u2019t be ashamed. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you. Most people do porn, yet many people don\u2019t admit to it or lie about it.\n\nThe statistics on this are all over the place.\n\nIn a general statement, considering current research for 2025 \u2013 about 80% of men and 35% of women watch porn.\n\nHowever, these statistics aren\u2019t very accurate. There are people who look at magazines and don\u2019t consider that as porn, and it is.\n\nWhy Do People Watch Porn\n\nSo the next question is, WHY do people even watch porn, to begin with?\n\nOf course, the first answer is that they want to \u201cget off\u201d.\n\nHowever, there are other reasons. For example, some also watch it to:\n\nGet themselves in the \u201cmood\u201d and increase sexual desire. This might be more so with women.\n\nCuriosity is another reason. Maybe you want to know more about some specific type of sexual act or whatever\u2026 you know, just use your imagination\n\nAnd one of the biggest reasons younger people watch porn is to learn. You can see how it\u2019s done, what turns a person on, techniques, and so forth. It might give you a much-needed confidence boost.\n\nWhat Are The Pros & Cons Of Porn?\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about the pros and cons of watching porn. What might be a benefit or a negative?\n\nWhen might porn be good or bad for you?\n\nI\u2019m sure many people will say there ARE no benefits and you\u2019re going to hell. But, we need to be open-minded and not judgemental.\n\nFor example, one benefit of watching porn, especially with your partner, is to add spice to your sex life.\n\nAs I stated earlier, many people watch porn to learn. Maybe the best way to give oral sex. Or different positions. How to give someone an orgasm.\n\nHOWEVER, there\u2019s a lot of stuff in porn that is NOT good to learn and perform. But I\u2019ll get to this later.\n\nWomen may watch porn to allow themselves to masturbate and thus, get more in touch with their bodies, which will help when they have sex with their partner.\n\nUnfortunately, porn can have a lot more negatives than positives.\n\nIf you are addicted to porn and are watching it many times a day, every single day, then this can be a major problem because:\n\nIt can rob you of valuable time\n\nCausing you to disconnect from and avoid an actual relationship and having sex with a partner.\n\nCreates an unrealistic reality of sex. Thus, the \u201creal world\u201d can be a big letdown.\n\nThis letdown can cause you to not perform or get as aroused when it comes to the actual act of having intercourse with a real person.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s a lot of stuff in porn that you should NOT do, and can be destructive to a relationship. It\u2019s stuff that many women would hate to have done to them.\n\nWatching a lot of porn and masturbating all the time, can cause performance or erectile problems.\n\nBecause you are watching porn and hence, a voyeur, it can create false expectations about real-life sex.\n\nWatching porn can definitely cause you to be insecure. The guys have extra big penises and it\u2019s always hard. The women are very attractive and always ready to go. It\u2019s all very unrealistic.\n\nNow, there are other negative hormonal and chemical effects of watching too much porn\u2026\n\nSuch as negative effects on dopamine levels and sensitivity. This can lead to addiction, which is a huge topic that I get a lot of private messages about from guys.\n\nOr if you watch a lot of porn and also masturbate, then negative changes in testosterone, prolactin, cortisol, estrogen, and so forth.\n\nBut like anything in life, \u201cthe poison is in the dose\u201d. This means that any drug can kill you if you take a high enough dose.\n\nAnd porn can be very bad for you if it\u2019s consuming your life. It can detach you from relationships and true intimacy with someone special on a much deeper level of joy and satisfaction.\n\nLastly, porn, especially the hardcore stuff, can be bad for brain and personality development for teenagers, so keep that in mind. Again, this is a huge topic by itself.\n\nThe truth is that these days, because of the internet, it\u2019s hard to escape porn and other forms of sexually explicit content.\n\nYou definitely do NOT need porn to have a healthy sex life.\n\nPeople who are anti-porn make some very valid points. It can be a dirty and unhealthy industry.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that many people can\u2019t explore some porn occasionally and enjoy it without any negativity.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/3-best-foods-for-increasing-your-testosterone-libido/",
    "content": "Now it is 2025 and I recently did a video about the 8 Best Herbs For Increasing Testosterone and I know this is a popular topic with guys and of course, it got a lot of views.\n\nHowever, a few guys asked, \u201cCan you give a list of specific foods to eat for increasing testosterone levels?\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, despite what a Google search will show you, there really is NOT a long list of foods for increasing testosterone and I\u2019ll tell you why in a couple of minutes.\n\nSure, some websites will list things like \u201cgreen leafy vegetables\u201d \u201coats\u201d or \u201cavocados\u201d and so forth. But, there\u2019s very little clinical evidence for these foods, let alone real-life empirical evidence.\n\nSadly\u2026 most foods will NOT increase testosterone levels. In fact, many foods will actually LOWER testosterone and libido\u2026 Which is the problem with most people\u2019s diets these days.\n\nAnd, I\u2019ll do a specific video about these \u201cbad\u201d foods in a few days.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of specific foods that really DO increase testosterone levels \u2013 clinically and empirically proven. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll quickly discuss today.\n\nNow, in the old days back in the 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, people like Vince Gironda and Arnold would eat steak and eggs.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t by accident because these two foods do help optimize testosterone levels. But why?\u2026\n\nThe first and primary food required for optimal hormonal production and testosterone levels is, fat and primarily animal fat.\n\nThis is because cholesterol is needed to produce hormones. And cholesterol is primarily found in animal proteins and animal fat.\n\nAnd this is why taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, can reduce testosterone and libido.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, eating cholesterol from your food does NOT mean that your blood cholesterol will go up. This is a false myth that the heart association has now admitted to.\n\nUnfortunately, most cholesterol-containing animal proteins, also have a lot of other potential health problems because the animals were fed bad foods, hormones, and so forth.\n\nSo, I think the best source of cholesterol fat is pasture-raised whole eggs. It contains the perfect amino acid ratios, bioavailable protein, and contains good cholesterol in the egg yolk.\n\nHonestly, when I eat 2 or 3 whole eggs before bed, I definitely wake up with better erections in the morning, and thus, a good sign that my testosterone production is optimal.\n\nI do have a more detailed video about eggs \u2013 what kind, how to cook them, and so forth.\n\nIn addition to fats that contain cholesterol, such as whole eggs\u2026 Healthy saturated fats, such as small amounts of coconut oil can also help with proper hormonal balance.\n\nI\u2019d also suggest a little bit of omega fats from fish oil and mono-unsaturated fats from extra virgin olive oil.\n\nIt may not be needed for testosterone production directly but does help indirectly.\n\nKeep in mind, vegans tend to have low testosterone levels and I think the lack of animal protein and cholesterol is one reason.\n\nAnother \u201caphrodisiac\u201d food you may have heard about is oysters. This is because oysters have high levels of the mineral, zinc.\n\nZinc helps boost testosterone levels because it helps lower two hormones:\n\nDHT (dihydrotestosterone) \u2013 which is linked to hair loss and prostate growth.\n\nEstrogen \u2013 which is linked to body fat, man boobs and so forth.\n\nAs testosterone converts to these two hormones, especially as we age, testosterone levels drop while DHT and estrogens rise.\n\nSo, by reducing these 2 hormones, testosterone levels can go back up.\n\nAnd zinc helps with this and thus, why eating oysters can help.\n\nGranted, I don\u2019t personally like the taste of oysters. Nor would I eat them daily.\n\nHowever, remember how earlier I said old-school bodybuilders ate steak and eggs? Well, the red meat is also high in zinc in addition to cholesterol, especially grass-fed, pasture-raised red meat. Bison is what I eat.\n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t want to consume red meat, you can also just take zinc in supplement form. It\u2019s best to also take it with copper.\n\nI\u2019ve listed the best supplement and a video dedicated to zinc.\n\nLastly, I want to mention Ginger.\n\nIn one study, taking ginger supplements daily for 3 months, increased testosterone levels by almost 18%. This is in humans.\n\nI think you\u2019d have to eat a lot of ginger daily to get the same amount found in a supplement.\n\nAs stated earlier, if you search the internet, you\u2019ll see lots of other supposed \u201ctestosterone-boosting\u201d foods, such as\n\nFruits such as bananas or berries\n\nForget these foods, they will do very little or nothing for your testosterone levels.\n\nMy goal is always to help save your time and money and give you the most efficient and effective ways to help you achieve your health, fitness, and longevity goals.\n\nAnd because of this one mission, I\u2019ve listed the best 3 foods:\n\nAnd if I had to pick just one, by far whole eggs are the best.\n\nDon\u2019t be like most people who passively listen.\n\nBe like the rare successful people and take action on what you\u2019ve learned today, get results, and live a better, healthier, and happier life!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.iasj.net/iasj?func=fulltext&aId=71548\n\nhttps://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4948075/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23472458",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal the 8 best herbs that are clinically & empirically proven to help increase your testosterone levels\u2026 And more importantly, KEEP testosterone elevated.\n\nI say \u201cmore importantly\u201d because it\u2019s kind of easy to increase testosterone levels\u2026 at least, temporarily.\n\nThe challenge is KEEPING your testosterone elevated, long-term.\n\nAnd this is because your body always wants to adapt and try to get to homeostasis \u2026\n\nWhich means that your body doesn\u2019t like change. It always wants to maintain stability and equilibrium. It\u2019s self-regulating.\n\nSo the herbs that I\u2019m going to talk about today:\n\nsome will increase your total testosterone levels.\n\nSome will increase your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels, which is the more active form of testosterone\n\nAnd other herbs that will KEEP your testosterone elevated, by reducing the conversion of testosterone to other hormones such as female hormones, DHT, and stress hormones.\n\nThis is the \u201csecret\u201d to increasing your testosterone and keeping it elevated in the long run for maximum effectiveness, and results\u2026 while reducing side effects such as fat gain, man boobs, hair loss, prostate problems, and so forth.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started on the 8 best herbs.\n\nIncrease In Total & Free Testosterone\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about some of the best herbs for increasing BOTH your total and free testosterone levels.\n\nFenugreek Extract, more specifically Testofen. It\u2019s been shown to almost double testosterone levels. BUT, you must take the correct extract form and dose.\n\nTongkat Ali (Eurycoma Longifolia Jack 100:1 extract) is another great herb. Again, make sure it\u2019s the 100:1 extract.\n\nAvena Sativa (Oat Straw 10:1 Extract) is one of the very first herbs I used almost 30 years ago. The biggest thing I noticed was a big boost in my sex drive. In fact, clinical studies have shown it can increase libido by about 70% for men and 76% for women.\n\nOnce we\u2019ve supported maximum youthful \u201ctotal\u201d & \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels within a normal, healthy range \u2013 we need to MAINTAIN them long-term. This can be achieved by promoting LH/FSH, which signals your testes to produce more testosterone.\n\nI\u2019ve found 2 proven herbs that work great for this:\n\nFadogia Agrestis (10:1 Extract) helps boost testosterone in both men and women. It does so by mimicking Luteinizing hormone, which signals the body to produce more testosterone. Neurologically (in the brain) it also acts as an aphrodisiac (increasing sexual desire & drive).\n\nPro-Tribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract (90% Sapongenins + 20% protodioscin) serves as a Luteinizing-hormone secretagogue (LHS) In other words, it supports the release of Luteinizing hormone, which in turn agonists the testes to promote more youthful Testosterone.\n\nFemale Hormone Balance\n\nAs men age, one primary reason for the decrease in testosterone is the INCREASE in female hormones, such as estrogen.\n\nThere are 3 main reasons for this:\n\nmore \u201caromatase\u201d enzyme, which converts testosterone to estrogens\n\nhigher body fat levels produce more estrogen\n\nenvironmental causes & toxins (foods, pesticides, plastics, etc.)\n\nThe end result is more belly fat, lowered libido, muscle loss, \u201cman boobs\u201d, and a negative or depressed mood.\n\nTo help lower excess estrogen levels, I use:\n\nWhite Button Mushroom Extract\n\nTestosterone / Cortisol Balance\n\nMost people think the opposite hormone to testosterone, is the female hormone \u2013 estrogen. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually the stress hormone, cortisol.\n\nAs stress hormones such as Cortisol go up, your testosterone levels go down.\n\nUnfortunately, aging and life stressors (such as work, relationships, worry, poor sleep, etc.) can cause unhealthy cortisol and stress levels.\n\nTo help fix this, I use Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium; Icariin 60% Extract) & Ashwagandha extract [KSM-66\u00ae] (32% oligosaccharides, 7% withanolide glycoside conjugates).\n\nMost specifically, the KSM-66\u00ae version has been shown to decrease cortisol AND increase testosterone at the same time.\n\nSo I\u2019ve listed these 8 herbs. They work synergetically together. So, ideally, it\u2019s best to take them all.\n\nUnfortunately, the problem I ran into myself years ago was that it\u2019s way too expensive and inconvenient to go buy 8 or more different ingredients and products.\n\nLuckily, there is ONE product that contains all of these specific ingredients, the correct extracts, and dosages.\n\nIn addition to other potent minerals such as zinc, amino acids tp improve Nitric Oxide and dopamine agonists.\n\nIt\u2019s an \u201call-in-one\u201d solution that I\u2019ve been using for over 22 years \u2013 called AlphaViril.\n\nAfter a couple of decades, I\u2019ve found the herbs I\u2019ve mentioned today, to be the most effective, clinically researched, and have a long history of both safety and efficacy.\n\nMost importantly, the empirical evidence, thus \u2013 the real-world positive feedback is what I care the most about and the only thing that really matters.\n\nSo, watch this video again and make sure you understand that your only goal should NOT be to just increase testosterone. Your body will quickly adapt and the positive effects will stop working.\n\nYou want to make sure you optimize your other hormones so your testosterone STAYS elevated long-term.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "I get a lot of messages from guys asking about the size of their testicles and how it affects their health.\n\n\u201cHey doc, I think my testicles are small. Or, maybe they\u2019ve shrunk over the years. My libido seems to have also decreased at the same time\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Robbins, how do small or smaller testicles negatively affect my health? What about having babies?\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Sam, when I watch \u201cmovies\u201d online, these guys show a lot more semen volume than I produce. Their testicles are also bigger than mine. I\u2019m assuming the two are related, correct?\u201d\n\nI can go on and on about the questions I receive about testicle health. So today I\u2019m going to quickly cover:\n\nTesticle size & how to measure it\n\nHow does testicle size affect testosterone levels\n\nDoes smaller testicles mean less fertility\n\nTesticle size and sleep\n\nTesticles size and heart health\n\nWhat causes small or shrinking testicles\n\nHow to increase testicle size & testosterone at the same time.\n\nTesticle Size & How To Measure It\n\nTesticle size varies from one person to another.\n\nAs far as the average size, they\u2019re between about 2 inches in length and around 5 cm. Testicles less than 1.5 inches or 3.5 cm are considered \u201csmall\u201d.\n\nI guess you can measure them with a tape measure or something similar, but they are typically measured with an ultrasound. Similar to how you measure or see a fetus in a mother\u2019s womb.\n\nDo Small Testicles Mean Less Fertility & Sperm\n\nThe testicles have 2 primary jobs:\n\nMake hormones, specifically testosterone.\n\nNow, let\u2019s first talk about fertility and sperm production.\n\nEven though small testicles can be just as fertile as larger ones, studies have shown that YES, smaller-sized testicles have reduced sperm density and quantity.\n\nIn fact, there are porn actors who take substances that increase their production of sperm and seminal fluid\u2026 Now, this is just done for show, the \u201cmoney shot\u201d\n\nHow Does Testicle Size Affect Testosterone Levels\n\nAs stated earlier, the other job of the testicles is to produce more testosterone.\n\nSimilar to fertility, even though guys with smaller testicles can produce a sufficient amount of testosterone, research has shown that larger testicles do produce more testosterone.\n\nIn fact, this is why when you take exogenous testosterone, such as injections or steroids or TRT or HRT, both your sperm volume and fertility go down. At the same time, all testosterone production STOPS by the testicles.\n\nTaking steroids or testosterone injections, or anything that shuts down your own production, is a powerful contraceptive. Not as good as the birth control pill for women, but about 85-90% effective.\n\nAnyway, when testosterone production by the testes stops due to the exogenous testosterone or steroids, your testicles shrink. Some more than others.\n\nFor some people, the testicles turn into tiny raisins and may even go back up into the stomach.\n\nBut usually, the use of testosterone will cause at least a 50% reduction in testicle size, even if sperm and testosterone production goes down by like 90% or more.\n\nTesticle Size & Sleep\n\nPoor sleep has also been associated with a decrease in testosterone production, as well as sperm quality, semen count, and testicle size.\n\nIn fact, just 1 or 2 nights of low sleep, like 3-4 hours or less, can drop your testosterone production by 50% or more.\n\nTesticle Size & Heart Health\n\nAs stated earlier, smaller testicles may produce less testosterone. And low levels of testosterone (\u201cLow-T\u201d) are linked to heart and cardiovascular problems.\n\nWhat Causes Small or Shrinking Testicles\n\nSimply stated, low testosterone levels are linked to small or shrinking testicles.\n\nThe medical term for this is \u201chypogonadism\u201d.\n\nAnd what causes lower testosterone levels? A few factors:\n\nAging is a primary one. In your late 20\u2019s, testosterone levels began to decline. After the age of 40, they are much lower in most men.\n\nBeing overweight and having higher body fat is another reason. Because this increases estrogen levels, which lowers testosterone.\n\nNot sleeping well, increases stress hormones such as cortisol, which also lowers testosterone.\n\nNot exercising, especially with weights.\n\nSimply stated, aging + an unhealthy modern lifestyle, are the problems. It\u2019s never only ONE thing, other than maybe aging being a definitive cause.\n\nTaking Testosterone Shrinks Testicles\n\nUnfortunately, these days, when you have low testosterone levels on a blood test, people are quick to want to take testosterone replacement therapy.\n\nOne big reason for this is that it\u2019s a very lucrative business for doctors.\n\nBut as stated earlier, taking testosterone exogenously, meaning artificial means, causes your testicles to shrink even more.\n\nThen some doctors will also prescribe HCG \u2013 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin. This hormone basically acts as LH and tells your testicles to produce testosterone and thus, keeps them from shrinking.\n\nUnfortunately, HCG also tends to increase estrogen levels a lot.\n\nSo now the doctor will put you on an aromatase inhibitor, to lower estrogen levels to a normal level.\n\nThe bottom line is, you now have to take testosterone, HCG, and an estrogen inhibitor for the rest of your life.\n\nHowever, what should be done first is to have your own body and testicles, endogenously, meaning from within, produce more testosterone naturally.\n\nNow you\u2019re working WITH your body and not against it. This is the best way to start and the safest, long-term solution.\n\nThis means bigger testicles, more testosterone production, and no need to take drugs since it\u2019s all done naturally from within and levels will be kept in a normal, healthy range.\n\nHow To Increase Testicle Size\n\nSo now we come to the end of today\u2019s topic and that is, how do you increase your testicle size, so you can also produce more testosterone, and improve sperm production, mobility, and health?\n\nYou can take HCG, to temporarily jump-start your testicles. This is not a long-term solution. Maybe for a month or two. But for most people, the testicles go back to normal, sub-par production.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve stated how lifestyle is so important and that\u2019s well beyond the scope or space we have in today\u2019s topic.\n\nI do have links to more details about lifestyle improvements to increase testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, there are a few, proven vitamins and herbs that can cause an increase in testosterone production and testicular growth.\n\nAnd because it\u2019s done naturally, endogenously, from within, it\u2019s a safe, long-term solution that requires no drugs, no injections and has no drug side effects.\n\nAs for vitamins and minerals, Vitamin D3, Zinc, Boron and Selenium are important.\n\nFor herbs, Testofen Fenugreek, Tongkat Ali, and Avena Sativa are all great and have a long track record.\n\nAlso, for an increase in LH, which can increase both testosterone and testicular size, Tribulus and Fadogia are good.\n\nBut keep in mind that none of these herbs work unless you take the EXTRACTS of them, and at the correct, clinically researched dosages.\n\nI use AlphaViril \u2013 which contains all these ingredients in clinically proven, correct forms and dosages. Give it a try and see how it works for you and let me know your thoughts and results.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/10-foods-to-boost-penis-blood-flow-fix-ed/",
    "content": "Today\u2019s subscriber question is:\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve noticed my erections aren\u2019t as good and only seem to get worse. I\u2019ve also read how poor erections is an indicator of potential heart problems due to poor blood flow and circulation.\n\nAre there any foods that will help improve circulation and hopefully improve blood flow to my penis? Are there foods that can actually fix and reverse erectile dysfunction? I always appreciate your honesty, please help me. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThis is an important question because you\u2019re right, having erectile problems is a pre-warning sign that you have or could be having potential heart problems, due to poor circulation. It can also negatively affect your brain.\n\nThus, having erectile problems might be a warning sign of a potential heart attack or stroke in the future.\n\nEven though all you might care about right now is your ability to get an erection and have sex. Maybe not feeling young or man enough. The bigger potential problem is avoiding a heart attack or stroke in the future.\n\nAnd yes, some foods will help improve circulation throughout your body and thus, improve blood flow to your heart, brain, and yes \u2013 your penis.\n\nBefore I list the 10 best foods, please know that hormones play a vital role in all of this. Better hormonal balance, such as higher testosterone levels within a healthy range, will help with erections and strengthening of your heart and other muscles \u2013 including your penis.\n\nYou can\u2019t forget about exercise. Lifting weights 3-5x a week and walking daily for at least 20-30 minutes will help.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s start with the 10 best blood flow-improving foods. I\u2019ll also give you some sample meals at the end.\n\nNitrates For Blood Flow\n\nCertain foods are rich in nitrates, which are known to improve blood flow by dilating and opening up blood vessels.\n\nLeafy Green Vegetables: Vegetables like spinach, and Swiss chard are rich in nitrates.\n\nBeets: Beets and beetroot juice also contain high levels of nitrates. I\u2019d rather you eat beets, than beet juice, which has more concentrated sugars.\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Foods\n\nThe next thing you want to do is reduce inflammation in the body. Unfortunately, as we age, inflammation goes higher. It\u2019s called Inflammaging.\n\nPart of the reason for inflammation is poor hormonal balance. For example, testosterone goes down, stress hormones such as cortisol go up and thus, you now have more inflammation, in addition to a bunch of other health problems such as high blood sugar, blood pressure, and yes, poor blood flow.\n\nChronic inflammation is bad and one reason is that it can restrict blood flow.\n\nFatty Fish: Eating fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, mackerel, and trout, can help improve cardiovascular health and blood flow to the penis due to their anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nBerries: Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries are packed with antioxidants that can improve blood flow by reducing inflammation and supporting blood vessel health.\n\nGarlic: Garlic has compounds that can help improve blood flow by relaxing blood vessels and reducing inflammation.\n\nAnother component to better blood flow is a gas called Nitric Oxide, which helps vasodilate your blood vessels and thus increase circulation with more blood. This is one of the ways PDE5 inhibitors such as Viagra and Cialis work.\n\nNuts and Seeds: Almonds, walnuts, and flaxseeds are rich in nutrients like arginine, which promotes the production of nitric oxide in the body, aiding blood vessel relaxation and improving circulation.\n\nWatermelon: This fruit contains citrulline \u2013 an amino acid, which is converted into arginine in the body, aiding in the production of nitric oxide for improved blood flow.\n\nDark Chocolate: Dark chocolate with high cocoa content contains flavonoids that can improve blood circulation by enhancing nitric oxide levels.\n\nFinally, there are specific antioxidants that can help strengthen the blood vessels, and thus, allow better blood flow.\n\nCitrus Fruits: Oranges, grapefruits, and lemons contain vitamin C and antioxidants that support blood vessel health and reduce the risk of vascular problems. Eat the actual fruit and not the fruit juice.\n\nOlive Oil: Rich in healthy fats and antioxidants, olive oil can support cardiovascular health and promote better blood circulation.\n\nHowever, olive oil, especially extra virgin, cold-pressed olive oil has other important qualities:\n\nBecause it\u2019s primarily composed of monounsaturated fats, especially oleic acid, which will help support healthy cholesterol levels by preventing plaque build-up in the arteries.\n\nIt contains polyphenols, which are powerful anti-inflammatories.\n\nIt also can increase Nitric Oxide production.\n\nLastly, it can help improve endothelial function and thus, make your blood vessels stronger and more pliable, like when you were younger.\n\nMy Plan To Improve Blood Flow\n\nI eat about half of these foods regularly.\n\nEarlier I mentioned a sample meal for you and one that I eat 3-4x weekly.\n\nI make a salad with spinach and baby greens and put salmon in it for my protein. Add in beets, a small amount of walnuts, and, blueberries. For the dressing, I use extra virgin olive oil and a little bit of balsamic vinegar. I season it with salt and pepper.\n\nIf I want to add in some extra carbs, I\u2019ll throw some quinoa into the salad.\n\nBy the way, quinoa also has blood flow-improving properties because it can help increase nitric oxide. Not by much. But it\u2019s a great source of quality carbs and a complete vegetarian protein. So, why not?\n\nThis meal is great for health, fitness, longevity, and yes \u2013 blood flow and better erections.\n\nI also take additional supplements to help with all of this.\n\nAlphaViril \u2013 for better testosterone and hormones.\n\nBlood Flow Optimizer \u2013 for healthy blood flow & stronger blood vessels\n\nInflame & Pain Relief \u2013 to help support healthy inflammation\n\nVitamin C \u2013 I take 3 grams daily. Basically, 1000 mg, with food, 3x daily\n\nDiet, exercise, and good sleep are all a priority. And the added supplements guarantee everything else is covered to help maximize optimal blood flow.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be like most people who just listen and don\u2019t do anything else. Take action.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/why-pre-workout-energy-supplements-are-bad-for-muscles-libido-fat-loss/",
    "content": "I get complaints from lots of guys in 2025 about their libido, feeling tired, having bad workouts, and so forth \u2013 and today I\u2019m going to talk about one factor that a lot of these workout guys have in common and that\u2019s taking pre-workout supplements, and stimulants \u2013 which I think are by far, the most abused and misused supplements in the world.\n\nAnd YES, I used to be one of these people myself years ago.\n\nThe problem with these supplements is that over time, they actually do the opposite. They can cause:\n\nmuscle loss and weakness,\n\nlowered testosterone levels,\n\nhigher stress hormones like cortisol,\n\nLowered sex drive and erectile problems,\n\nFatigue \u2013 both physical and mental\n\nand worst of all \u2013 poor sleep quality and quantity\u2026. Which makes all the previous problems much worse!!!\n\nSo today I\u2019ll quickly let you know why these problems happen, how to fix them, and best of all, how you can make your own pre-workout supplement for a fraction of the price.\n\nProblems With Pre-Workout Supplements\n\nThe first problem is that these products are mainly composed of cheap calories from sugars \u2013 which are excess calories that you don\u2019t need. I mean, unless you\u2019re doing a 2-3 hour marathon workout, you have no need for all these sugar calories.\n\nBy the way, such long workouts are a primary problem itself that needs to be addressed and I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\nOne thing regarding the extra sugar in these supplements \u2013 it causes insulin resistance over time, which means more belly fat and muscle loss.\n\nLastly, higher sugar leads to lower testosterone production as well. In one human clinical study, taking 75 grams of sugar (which is 300 calories), can cause a 25% drop in testosterone levels for a couple of hours.\n\nThe second problem is that the only effective ingredients in these supplements are just high-dose caffeine \u2013 usually, at least 150-200 mg of caffeine to as much as 400-500 mg of caffeine.\n\nAnd caffeine is super cheap and I\u2019ll show you you can get the same benefits for a couple of pennies.\n\nOf course, these products advertise that they contain all of these other ingredients \u2013 but, they are typically super-low-dosed and thus, a total waste of money.\n\nIn essence, these supplements are overpriced forms of sugar and caffeine \u2013 a total rip-off.\n\nBut, What\u2019s The Real Problem?\n\nSo, why do most people, including myself, use such pre-workout stimulants?\u2026 Well, it\u2019s mainly because we were too tired to have a good workout without them.\n\nAnd thus, the real problem is \u2013 why are we so tired?\n\nFor me, it was too much school AND work, combined with poor sleep and going too crazy with the workouts \u2013 volume + intensity.\n\nAnd most people are similar because you\u2019re:\n\nnot getting enough sleep\n\nWorking out too often. You need to have more rest days\n\nWorking out too hard, it\u2019s too stressful \u2013 too many sets, too much volume, too much intensity, and so forth.\n\nYou need to improve your diet \u2013 increase protein and probably healthy carbs as well, in addition to essential fats.\n\nToo much outside stress \u2013 relationships, work, money, family, worry, etc.\n\nAnd most likely, it\u2019s a combination of the above.\n\nYou Are Just Digging Your Own Grave\n\nBut if you keep taking stimulants found in most pre-workout supplements or anything with high doses of caffeine\u2026 in order to give you the \u201cfake energy\u201d, so you can have a decent workout\u2026 You\u2019re just digging your own grave and causing yourself much bigger problems.\n\nAll of this just adds more and more stress to your body, causing you to sleep less and cause even more hormonal imbalances.\n\nPlus, you need to know that stimulants themselves cause systemic fatigue by over-stimulating the beta-adrenergic receptors, which can make them resistant to your own adrenaline.\n\nSo now, what little adrenaline you do produce, your body is resistant to.\n\nWhen that happens, your strength, power, endurance, and drive disappear \u2013 which means these stimulants are no longer working like they used to.\n\nAnyway, all of this killing your hormones, ruining your body & mind \u2013 and it\u2019s negatively affecting your performance in AND out of the bedroom\n\nThe first thing we need to address is why are you so tired? Thus, improving all of the previously mentioned stressors.\n\nFor me, I needed more rest and better sleep. So, I added more rest days at the gym to improve my recovery.\n\nBetter sleep is another topic all by itself.\n\nJust know that ALL stimulants, especially at higher doses found in these products, will RUIN both your sleep quality and quantity.\n\nWithout proper sleep, you are screwed\u2026 and not in a good way.\n\nCreate your own pre-workout solution at a fraction of the price, with no calories and with very few stimulants.\n\nThus all the benefits, with none of the high side-effects or prices.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what I do.\n\nIn the morning, I take Body-Brain Energy which is a nootropic-based, supplement that\u2019s actually GOOD for both your body and brain.\n\nIt helps increase focus, muscular strength, contractions, brain cognition, and so forth.\n\nIt helps your hormones and sex drive, it doesn\u2019t hurt it like the pre-workout stimulants.\n\nI take Body-Brain Energy almost every day, especially during the workweek \u2013 again, first thing in the morning.\n\nBefore my workouts, IF I really need it, I take Body-Brain Energy again and I\u2019ll add in a little bit of caffeine, only 50 mg. You may need 100 mg if you\u2019re used to taking so much caffeine daily.\n\nGet a bottle of no-dose or some generic caffeine pill which is 200 mg tablets. The key is getting tablets, NOT a capsule.\n\nI use ProLab caffeine tablets. Each pill is 200 mg, and I cut it into quarters. So, each quarter is 50 mg.\n\nThus, at the Amazon price of $20 for 3 bottles, which is 300 pills. At \u00bc the daily dose, which you\u2019re taking only on workout days, will last you at least 3-4 YEARS.\n\nWhich is about 1.5 pennies a dose. THAT IS IT!\n\nCombined with a premium, super high-quality, doctor-formulated nootropic supplement such as Body-Brain Energy, you\u2019re paying like a $1 per workout.\n\nThe end result is you look and feel great. Your hormones, body, and brain improve. You\u2019ll get BETTER results over time and most importantly, healthy hormones and sleep quality.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "In one of my more popular videos with almost 8 million views, titled \u201c4 Clinically Proven Ways To Increase Your Testosterone\u201d, someone asked:\n\n\u201cDoes Tumeric or Curcumin increase or decrease testosterone levels? I did research and I\u2019m getting conflicting results. Please help give me clarity.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a good question because you\u2019re right \u2013 there are studies showing that it does increase testosterone and some showing it decreases it.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know what this herb is, basically curcumin as a naturally-occurring chemical found in the spice, turmeric.\n\nSo, the real benefits are with the active ingredient or extract, curcumin.\n\nYou\u2019d have to take a lot of turmeric powder, to get some of the positive benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s why I suggest taking specific forms of concentrated extract, which is far more potent than taking spoonfuls of the spice, turmeric.\n\nThe Benefits Of Curcumin\n\nNow, curcumin has lots of benefits and one of the primary ones is to reduce inflammation. This is a vital key for health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nA major benefit of reducing inflammation is less pain.\n\nWhich we all need as we age.\n\nCurcumin And Testosterone\n\nAs far as testosterone production, one of the benefits of curcumin is a slight reduction in estrogen levels.\n\nIn men, as estrogen increases, testosterone decreases due to negative feedback loops with the hypothalamus, and pituitary gland\u2026 which will then affect GnRH, FSH, LH, and so on and so forth.\n\nThus, by lowering estrogen, you\u2019ll naturally increase testosterone levels.\n\nSo, this is ONE of the indirect ways taking curcumin may help increase testosterone, by decreasing estrogen levels.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t expect miracles.\n\nBesides, there are other factors and hormones involved when it comes to optimizing testosterone \u2014 DHT, free and bound testosterone, prolactin, SHBG, cortisol, and so forth.\n\nUse curcumin and other anti-inflammatory herbs to reduce inflammation and pain, but not for increasing testosterone.\n\nUse a complete and clinically validated product like AlphaViril to help optimize ALL of your hormones, by increasing the positive \u201cyouthful\u201d hormones such as total and free testosterone, FSH, LH, etc. \u2013 while decreasing negative, \u201caging\u201d hormones such as female hormones, estrogen, prolactin, DHT, stress hormones, and so forth.\n\nIt\u2019s a 20+ year proven formula and convenient solution that really works and comes with a one-year guarantee.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5354546/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941414/\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jncimono/article/2000/27/113/934445",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and more men are suffering from urinary flow issues (slow & weak stream) and prostate problems. Not only is this uncomfortable, but it could be an indicator of prostate cancer. Let\u2019s start with today\u2019s subscriber question:\n\nQA: Dr. Sam \u2013 I have a major problem\u2026 my urine is coming out drop by drop. It doesn\u2019t have a good, strong flow like it used to. My friend said it could be prostate cancer. What should I do?\n\nWell, it may or may not be and today I\u2019ll give you the potential causes and solutions for this problem.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t know your age. And I mention this because as men get older, especially in their 60s and beyond, this drop-by-drop can be more common. However, if it\u2019s happening to you at an earlier age, then you could have a big issue.\n\nSo, let\u2019s first talk about all the potential causes of this urine and \u201cdrop-by-drop\u201d issue. And then I\u2019ll reveal the solutions, both natural, medical, and even surgical.\n\nOf course, before I start, I need to give you a legal disclaimer to always consult with your doctor before you do anything.\n\nBefore I begin, this video is going to be a little longer than my usual ones and more detailed because this is a super important topic \u2013 life or death type of topic.\n\nThis is because having urinary flow, prostate, and/or erection problems is a big warning sign that something is really wrong.\n\nFor one, these are early warning signs of heart problems \u2013 hence, a heart attack or stroke.\n\nSecond, these issues can also mean cancer \u2013 more specifically, prostate cancer\u2026 which can lead to other cancers if untreated.\n\nSo, our goal is to find out problems as early as possible so we can help avoid long-term bigger problems.\n\nFor example, I have a very close physician friend of mine who is the head of oncology and missed his dad\u2019s prostate cancer 2 years earlier. Now his dad has 3-4 years to live because the cancer has spread.\n\nAnd, just today I got an email from one of my subscribers saying they have stage 4 prostate cancer\u2026 Again, because their doctor missed it. Now the cancer has spread to his bones.\n\nUnfortunately, his doctor is using a very outdated method of dealing with cancer, which is to castrate him and kill all of his hormones medically and thus, his manhood.\n\nSo yes, this is very important because I don\u2019t want this to happen to you or someone you know.\n\nPlease listen carefully. Share this with other people so you can help them as well because, at the end of the day, YOU and I need to be our own advocates and doctors for our own health.\n\nDon\u2019t let your health be in the hands of other people.\n\nDo your research and learn from others, not just me. I know it can be confusing and my goal is to simplify it as much as possible, without dumping things down since I know my readers are smart.\n\nOf course, I need also to give a legal disclaimer because of the world we live in. So, here it goes \u2013 don\u2019t do anything I say. This is for entertainment purposes only. ALWAYS speak to your doctor before you do anything in this world.\n\n3 Main Causes & Solutions For Urinary And Prostate Problems\n\nSo I\u2019m going to keep things simple and focus on the 3 biggest causes of urinary and prostate problems and of course, the best solutions for all 3. The last one is the primary cause, so make sure you watch to the end.\n\nUrinary Tract Infections (UTIs):\n\nThis is more common in women. Infections in the urinary tract can lead to painful and difficult urination. Your doctor would tell you if you have this or not, it\u2019s a simple urine test.\n\nThere are a few causes, medical conditions, and lifestyle factors.\n\nUncircumcised penis: Studies suggest a slightly higher risk of UTIs in uncircumcised men due to potential bacterial accumulation beneath the foreskin.\n\nUnderlying bladder issues: Bladder stones, enlarged prostate, or nerve damage can hinder proper bladder emptying, creating an environment favorable for bacterial growth.\n\nCatheter use: Men requiring urinary catheters are more susceptible to UTIs due to the direct access to bacteria.\n\nMy dad had to deal with this, so I\u2019m very familiar with it.\n\nSexual activity: Friction during sexual activity can introduce bacteria into the urethra, increasing UTI risk.\n\nPoor hygiene: Inadequate genital hygiene, especially after sexual activity, can allow bacteria to thrive. Make sure to pee after an orgasm to help push out any bacteria that may have gotten in during sex.\n\nDehydration: Insufficient water intake can concentrate urine, creating a less hospitable environment for bacteria but also potentially triggering bladder irritation that can mimic UTI symptoms.\n\nCertain medications: Some medications, like antibiotics for other infections, can indirectly increase UTI risk by altering the natural bacterial balance in the body caused by antibiotics.\n\nThe solution would be a simple course of antibiotics. This is of course, in addition to trying to abstain from the previously mentioned causes.\n\nStones in the bladder can block the passage of urine.\n\nGenetics aside, this is typically caused by diet.\n\nHigh intake of certain minerals: Excessive consumption of calcium, oxalate (found in foods like spinach, rhubarb, and nuts), and purine (found in red meat and organ meats) can increase the risk of stone formation.\n\nFluid deficiency: Drinking enough water dilutes urine and prevents mineral buildup, so dehydration can contribute to stone formation. Unfortunately, most people are severely dehydrated.\n\nA diet low in fiber: Fiber helps bind minerals in the digestive system, reducing their absorption and ultimately lessening the risk of stones. Like dehydration, most people lack fiber in their diet.\n\nThese days, the solution is fairly \u201csimple\u201d, at least compared to the old days. A small telescope will be passed through the urethra into the bladder. A laser or other device will be used to break up the stones and the pieces will be removed.\n\nIf the stones are too big, they may need to be removed using open surgery. Drugs are rarely used to dissolve the stones.\n\nOf course, as stated before, we need to also focus on abstaining from the previously mentioned causes.\n\nFinally and probably the primary cause is prostate issues, especially as men get older. Unfortunately, these prostate problems are now affecting YOUNGER guys.\n\nAn enlarged prostate (BPH \u2013 benign prostatic hyperplasia) can obstruct the urethra, causing urinary difficulties.\n\nHow do you know if you have this? There are two primary ways.\n\nThe first is your doctor will do a rectal exam. Basically, he\u2019ll stick his finger in your anus and check if the prostate has enlarged.\n\nMost should start doing a rectal exam at the age of 40. The sooner we test, the sooner we can catch any potential problems.\n\nThe second is doing a blood test and checking your PSA levels, which stands for Prostate-specific antigen. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland.\n\nElevated levels of PSA may indicate an enlarged prostate or possibly the presence of prostate cancer.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the prostate will grow in ALL men if they live long enough. It\u2019s hormonal and genetics.\n\nHowever, just because there is enlargement, especially during a rectal exam, it doesn\u2019t mean cancer, but it will mean that all of us guys will have urine-flow issues to some extent, the longer we live.\n\nThere are a variety of causes of elevated PSA levels \u2013 genetics aside and aging as I just mentioned, it\u2019s caused by hormonal problems.\n\nBefore I speak about hormonal problems, certain drugs can also cause temporary increases in PSA and the enlargement of your prostate. The 5 most common or popular ones are:\n\nSteroids: this includes both anabolic such as testosterone, as well as catabolic such as cortisol or cortisone medications. This typically affects athletes, bodybuilders and even guys on TRT and HRT.\n\nAntihistamines: Some over-the-counter antihistamines, like diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can cause urinary retention and difficulty urinating due to their anticholinergic effects. These drugs are also found in over the counter sleeping drugs \u2013 such a Tylenol PM.\n\nDecongestants: Certain nasal decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine, can lead to urinary retention and decreased urine flow. Amphetamines fall into this class. So, any of you on ADHD drugs, be careful.\n\nAntidepressants: Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may cause urinary hesitancy and retention in some individuals.\n\nOpioid Pain Medications: Opioids like morphine, codeine, and oxycodone can cause constipation, which may indirectly lead to urinary retention.\n\nThere are TWO solutions here.\n\nImprove the HORMONES.\n\nI suggest doing both.\n\nDRUGS That Improve Flow\n\nImproving the flow will happen once you improve the hormones. However, if we want to do it with drugs \u2013 we have a couple of options:\n\nFlomax (tamsulosin) is an alpha-1 blocker. It blocks a specific type of receptor found in the prostate. By blocking these receptors, the medication works by relaxing the muscles in your prostate and bladder, which relieves symptoms of BPH by making it easier to urinate.\n\nSIDE EFFECTS of this are low blood pressure, weakness, erectile problems, and decreased semen production.\n\nHytrin (terazosin) This is more of an indirect method because it treats high blood pressure. It works by relaxing blood vessels, which decreases the amount of work the heart has to do. It may also be used to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate (BPH \u2013 benign prostatic hyperplasia)\n\nSIDE EFFECTS of this are dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is primarily caused by the low blood pressure.\n\nCialis (tadalafil) You\u2019ve probably heard of the erectile drug, Cialis and Viagra. Both work for better erections because of the improved blood flow. Both work to lower blood pressure again, like the previously mentioned drugs.\n\nIn fact, hypertension is what Viagra was originally made for. The SIDE effect or benefit was better erections.\n\nWell, Cialis is similar but long-acting and it\u2019s also used to help with an enlarged prostate (BPH \u2013 benign prostatic hyperplasia)\n\nBottom Line: Improve blood flow and blood pressure.\n\nNATURAL SUPPLEMENTS That Improve Flow\n\nIf you want to do this naturally, there are lots of herbs and amino acids that do this. Many don\u2019t work, a few do work very well.\n\nThis is the problem with supplements, most of them are just a ripoff.\n\nRather than listing all of the best herbs and amino acids can cause overwhelm for you and extra costs\u2026 I\u2019ve simplified it down to two supplements that contain all the best ones.\n\nThese two \u201call-in-one\u201d supplements are the ones I personally use, as well as friends, family, and clients.\n\nThey are Blood FLOW Optimizer and Blood PRESSURE Optimizer. The name says it all.\n\nOf course, these supplements help support healthy prostate function but have so many other whole-body benefits. It\u2019s just something we should take, especially after the age of 30 or 35.\n\nHORMONES That Improve BPH\n\nNow that we have improved the FLOW, we need to finally focus on what I believe to be the primary cause of prostate problems and that\u2019s hormonal causes and solutions.\n\nEarlier I stated how one of my subscribers said his doctor is going to treat his prostate problems by medically castrating him. Thus, kills his testosterone levels.\n\nYes, this works ONLY because of the INDIRECT outcome of having NO testosterone.\n\nYou see, scientists and researchers have known for years that testosterone does directly NOT cause prostate problems, growth, or prostate cancer.\n\nOr else, young men with the highest testosterone would all have prostate issues.\n\nInstead, older men who have the lowest testosterone have the highest prostate problems. Why?\u2026\n\nBecause the real cause is what testosterone CONVERTS to \u2013 which are 2 primary hormones, estrogens, and DHT.\n\nDHT is linked to hair loss, body hair growth, and yes, prostate problems.\n\nEstrogen is also linked to these issues, in addition to other cancers \u2013 such as both prostate and breast.\n\nAnd yes, men get breast cancer.\n\nIf you have gynecomastia or man boobs, this is a potential indicator of future problems. This means that your body more readily converts to estrogen because you have higher levels of the aromatase enzyme \u2013 which converts testosterone to estrogens.\n\nAlso, higher body fat will do this and thus, can more estrogen conversions.\n\nOf course, GENETICS plays a big role in these enzymatic conversions. So, if you are hairy, balding, overweight, have man boobs, etc\u2026 then you really need to focus on improving your hormones.\n\nAlso, higher blood sugar and insulin levels are indirectly linked to all of these problems and so many other health problems.\n\nSo, our goal is to keep testosterone to high, normal levels naturally. While we reduce excess conversion to both estrogens and DHT.\n\nOne last time, as estrogen levels increase, your body\u2019s estrogen-inhibiting hormone also increases.\n\nDo you know what that hormone is?\u2026 Yes, it\u2019s DHT. Dihydrotestosterone is a natural estrogen inhibitor.\n\nAs estrogen goes, so can DHT levels.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the saying \u201cshort fat, bald and hairy\u201d?\n\nWell, the short and fat have to do with estrogen.\n\nBald and hairy has to do with DHT.\n\nYes, I\u2019ve simplified all of this, but this isn\u2019t medical school \u2013 so, this is good enough for most of us.\n\nSo, how do we lower these \u201cnegative\u201d hormones to more acceptable, lower \u2026 yet normal levels?\n\nRemember, we want everything to be natural and in normal ranges. The goal is HIGH testosterone. But lower estrogen and DHT.\n\nAll within the normal ranges, but on opposite sides.\n\nBy the way, when Estrogen and DHT increase, testosterone DECREASES. We don\u2019t want this. This is what happens to older guys and it\u2019s happening to younger people these days.\n\nThus, our goal of lowering estrogen and DHT will automatically cause an increase in our powerful GOOD hormone, testosterone.\n\nIt\u2019s a win/win situation.\n\nDRUGS that Lower Estrogen & DHT\n\nNow, we can lower estrogen and DHT through very powerful enzyme inhibitors.\n\nInhibiting the aromatase enzymes will lower estrogen levels, more specifically, the potent estradiol levels.\n\nDrugs that do this would typically be Arimidex, Femara, and Aromasin. If I had to pick one, I like Aromasin the best because it\u2019s not as bad on your lipid levels.\n\nSIDE EFFECTS of these drugs and lowering estrogen too low are joint pain, fatigue, cholesterol problems and yes, erectile problems and impotence.\n\n5-Alpha Reductase inhibitors will lower your DHT levels.\n\nDrugs that will do this are Finasteride \u2013 with 5 mg Proscar and also 1 mg Propecia. Or a much more potent drug called dutasteride, by the trade name Avodart.\n\nSIDE EFFECTS of these drugs are loss of drive, anxiety, depression, and yes, impotence.\n\nAnd if you take 5-alpha Reductase drugs by themselves, such as for hair loss guys take Propecia or Proscar, your estrogen levels go up and you can get gynecomastia or man boobs.\n\nThus, typically, both estrogen and DHT inhibitors should be taken together. Or managed simultaneously.\n\nThe major problem with these drugs is that they are super strong. They inhibit these hormones and other adrenal hormones a lot, too much in most people.\n\nSo, it\u2019s hard to control their negative side effects unless you do lots of blood tests and work with a very competent physician, preferably an endocrinologist.\n\nBut, good luck finding one. Who is willing to listen, do proper blood tests, and be up to date with the real research \u2013 not what they are told to by the pharmaceutical companies?\n\nInstead, a better way is to first start by lowering estrogen and DHT to lower, normal levels NATURALLY.\n\nThis way, you get all the benefits, but without the negative side effects.\n\nFor lowering estrogen, my favorites are DIM and White Button Mushroom Extract.\n\nFor lowering DHT, I would suggest Zinc with Copper.\n\nI know a lot of people suggest Saw Palmetto Extract \u2013 but that can cause erectile problems in men. While Zinc actually improves erections.\n\nThere\u2019s an all-in-one supplement called AlphaViril that contains all of these ingredients, plus natural testosterone boosters. It\u2019s one I\u2019ve been taking for over 20+ years and you\u2019ve probably heard of me mention it in the past.\n\nIt contains all the proven ingredients and the correct dosages. So, it\u2019s simple, easy, and convenient, and yes \u2013 it ends up saving you money too.\n\nAll the products I\u2019ve mentioned come with a one-year guarantee, so it\u2019s no risk.\n\nImprove Your Lifestyle\n\nOne last and very important thing before ending today\u2019s topic, none of this matters if you don\u2019t improve your lifestyle. This means:\n\nEat better, natural foods. Don\u2019t eat so many carbs or processed foods or fats. You know what\u2019s health. Please don\u2019t act dumb.\n\nMake sure you exercise daily \u2013 3x a week with weights and the other 3-4x with some kind of cardio \u2013 I think brisk walking is great and can be done anywhere, anytime.\n\nManage your stress levels because high cortisol will make everything worse. There are supplements for lowering cortisol, such as Stress & Cortisol Relief.\n\nFinally, make sure you get good, deep-quality sleep every night. This is so important. Yet, one that most people take for granted. Even I don\u2019t prioritize this as much as I should because I get busy with work, life, and so forth.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve revealed a lot here today. I\u2019ve done it all because this is an important topic and I care about you. These are all things I do myself.\n\nI\u2019ve done my best to also keep things simple.\n\nIf you found this helpful, which I hope you have, please make sure you share this video with others. You\u2019re helping people and it costs you no money to share and only a few seconds.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "In both men AND women, one of the main conditions for having optimal sex drive and desire is to have optimal levels of the hormone, Testosterone. Remember, that both men and women have this hormone, but it\u2019s much higher in men.\n\nUnfortunately, as we age, our anti-aging \u201cyouth\u201d hormones decline. For men, this is primarily your testosterone levels.\n\nThe bad news is that your testosterone starts dropping as early as your mid 20\u2019s\n\nBy age 40, you\u2019re barely producing 50% of your testosterone\u2026 which means:\n\nDecrease sex drive & libido\n\nSmaller & weaker muscles.\n\nIncrease in health problems \u2014 cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, joint pain, memory loss, etc.\n\nHowever, the good news is that you can slow down and quickly REVERSE this naturally, by utilizing the correct form and dosage of Avena Sativa Extract, especially when combined with a few other key herbs and vitamins.\n\nAnd YES, this works for women as well.\n\nAvena Sativa is the scientific name for the grass commonly known as oats. It\u2019s been used medicinally since the Middle Ages.\n\nHow Does It Work For Increasing Testosterone?\n\nAvena Sativa works in two primary ways.\n\nAs you may already know, testosterone is the primary hormone that controls your libido, \u201cdrive\u201d, mental happiness, increased muscle, decreased fat, and an overall improved sense of well-being.\n\nUnfortunately, over 95% of your \u201ctotal\u201d testosterone is \u201cbound\u201d to various proteins in your blood. So most of it is \u201cinactive\u201d.\n\nThus, only 5% or less is \u201cfree\u201d to travel around your body and work its magic.\n\nThink of your \u201ctotal\u201d testosterone as your GROSS income and your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone as your NET income \u2014 the money you get to keep after all your expenses and taxes.\n\nThus, what we care most about is increasing your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels, which is what Avena Sativa can help with.\n\nSecondly, it helps increase your LH levels. Luteinizing hormones are released by the pituitary gland and tell the testicles to produce more testosterone.\n\nSo the end results are higher testosterone with more free testosterone, at the same time! \u2013 win/win!\n\nSide-Effects & Warnings\n\nEven though Avena Sativa is natural, there are some \u201cwarnings\u201d you should know about before using this ingredient.\n\nMost Avena Sativa on the market is made of dead \u201croot\u201d or \u201cpowder\u201d or even \u201cdrops\u201d. These forms are cheap and worthless. There are no active ingredients in it. This is why it doesn\u2019t work for most people.\n\nYou want to use only the EXTRACT form, one of the highest and most potent being a 100:1, extract-to-powder ratio.\n\nThe second problem I\u2019ve seen over and over again is when using only ONE ingredient to achieve a health goal \u2014 such as Avena Sativa in today\u2019s example\u2026. Is that your body will quickly adapt to it.\n\nThus, it stops working after a couple of weeks.\n\nUnfortunately, as your body adapts, you have to use a higher dosage which after a few weeks your body adapts AGAIN and now you have to increase the dosage even more.\n\nThis gets very expensive and can lead to negative side effects eventually.\n\nHowever, if you use a \u201cstacking\u201d tactic \u2013 which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute, you\u2019ll dramatically reduce the adaptation and improve the effectiveness, WITHOUT having to increase the dosage.\n\nThe final problem is that as you age, your body creates various enzymes that convert testosterone to \u201cnegative\u201d hormones, such as estrogen, prolactin, DHT, cortisol, etc.\n\nAll of these \u201cconversions\u201d DECREASE your positive testosterone and INCREASE these negative hormones.\n\nEstrogen makes you fat.\n\nProlactin reduces the frequency of erections.\n\nDHT causes hair loss and prostate problems\n\nCortisol is the stress hormone and directly DECREASES testosterone.\n\nWe don\u2019t want these \u201cnegative\u201d conversions.\n\nWhat you want to do is increase your testosterone and KEEP IT HIGH, by preventing and stopping the conversions to these \u201cnegative\u201d hormones.\n\nAnd to accomplish this goal, we\u2019ll need to use other ingredients which help BLOCK these conversions, naturally \u2013 and I\u2019ll show you how in a minute.\n\nHow To Make It Work Better For Increasing Testosterone\n\nTo make Avena Sativa work better, you want to \u201cstack\u201d it with other complementary natural ingredients which will help:\n\nIncrease testosterone \u2013 both total and free.\n\nReduce \u201cadaptation\u201d, so you get better results with lower dosages\n\nPrevent \u201cconversions\u201d to negative hormones, so you can KEEP your testosterone high.\n\nTo do this, you should take Avena Sativa with synergistic ingredients such as:\n\nFenugreek, Tongkat Ali, Maca, Stinging Nettle, and Tribulus extract, for optimal testosterone levels.\n\nDIM and Selenium reduce the female hormone, estrogen\n\nVitamin C and Ashwagandha to reduce the stress hormone, cortisol\n\nVitex Agnus to reduce the female hormone, prolactin\n\nZinc to reduce the hair loss and prostate problems hormone, DHT\n\nThe special synergy between these correct \u201cstack of ingredients\u201d, creates a much safer and more effective solution.\n\nIt\u2019s like 1+1+1 = 6 (not 3!) You use less, and you get more.\n\nThe \u201cstack\u201d saves you money and gives you better, safer results, for a longer amount of time.\n\nSummary & Your Best Option\n\nSo Avena Sativa works by increasing your total and \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels.\n\nTo prevent \u201cadaptation\u201d and \u201cconversions\u201d to negative hormones, you\u2019ll want to \u201cstack\u201d it with other synergistic ingredients.\n\nIn the end, you\u2019ll get better results, it\u2019s safer for you and you\u2019ll save money at the same time.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve simplified all of this for you.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "\"Increase My Libido & Testosterone\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb So I wasn\u2019t planning on ever writing an article about this topic, however\u2026 I get a lot of questions about it. So, today I\u2019m going to discuss masturbation and how it affects your body, mind and relationships.\n\nI\u2019ll discuss the benefits, the negatives, what\u2019s defined as \u201cexcess\u201d masturbation and the difference between having an orgasm through masturbating vs intercourse.\n\nAnd trust me, IF you\u2019re someone who masturbates \u2014 a little or a lot \u2014 man or woman \u2014 you\u2019ll definitely want to read this article.\n\nBenefits Of Masturbation\n\nMasturbation is very natural and most people do it. In fact, your body NEEDS to have an orgasm and that\u2019s what \u201cwet dreams\u201d are. It happens more often to men because of their higher testosterone levels, but it still happens to women.\n\nSo, you can either have an orgasm by yourself (masturbation)\u2026 or with someone \u2026 or if you do neither, your body will \u201crelease\u201d it on its own through a \u201cwet dream\u201d or a \u201cnocturnal emission\u201d.\n\nThe benefits of having an orgasm is that it can help you relax, reduce anxiety and blood pressure, sleep better, improves blood flow and helps you live longer by reducing stress hormones.\n\nFor men, it helps increase your testosterone levels and reduce prostate problems, when it\u2019s not done \u201cexcessively\u201d. For women, it helps reduce menstrual pain and duration.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have someone to be sexual with, then it\u2019s time for you to masturbate, so you can get some of these health benefits.\n\nUnfortunately, almost anything good in excess can be bad for you as well.\n\nNegatives Of Masturbation\n\nSo, let\u2019s move on to the \u201cnegatives\u201d of masturbation and more specifically, EXCESSIVE masturbation.\n\nHowever, we first need to define what \u201cexcessive\u201d really is. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be a subjective answer. But, generally speaking \u2013 if it\u2019s \u201ccompulsive\u201d \u2026.or \u2026. you\u2019re thinking about it throughout the day, almost every day \u2026 or \u2026 it\u2019s getting in the way of your life and daily activities \u2026 or \u2026 preventing you from having or maintaining a relationship \u2026 or \u2026 you feel bad about it and guilt \u2026 or \u2026 it\u2019s becoming an \u201caddiction\u201d \u2026 then you are masturbating excessively.\n\nAnd, not only does this negatively impact your life, like a drug\u2026 But it ALSO negatively affects your physical AND mental health as well.\n\nFor example, men in their 20\u2019s, 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, who \u201cfrequently\u201d masturbated 5X a week or more, have been linked to an INCREASE in prostate problems for men.1 While the same amount done by men in their 50\u2019s, REDUCED the risk of prostate problems.1\n\nMen who masturbate \u201cexcessively\u201d, have less sensitivity during sex and take longer to climax. Additionally, they can also suffer from erectile dysfunction and \u201creduced firmness\u201d\u2026 and I\u2019ll expand on this in a minute.\n\nHOW You Masturbate Is Also A Problem\n\nAnother problem is HOW you masturbate.\n\nFor example, many women who masturbate tend to use \u201ctoys\u201d \u2013 such as vibrators and dildos. Evidence has shown they take longer to climax during sex and have less sensitivity.\n\nMen who masturbate, typically watch porn. Well, this also reduces sensitivity and expectations when it comes to having sexual intercourse. Additionally, there are negative neurological changes for men who masturbate daily to porn.\n\nThere\u2019s an over the release of Dopamine, the \u201cpleasure chemical\u201d and this then causes a negative rebound and reduces sensitivity at the dopamine receptors. The basically SAME problem that happens to cocaine users.2\n\nThus, you need \u201cmore\u201d to get the same pleasurable feelings.\n\nThe other problem for guys is that the initial increase in testosterone eventually causes a DECREASE because there\u2019s an increase in female hormones \u2013 such as prolactin and estrogen.5\n\nThe end result is lower testosterone levels and THIS ends up causing you to age faster, lose muscle, get depressed, moody, and eventually \u2013 have erectile problems.3\n\nExcess masturbation has also been linked to accelerate hair loss and balding, due to an increase in the balding hormone, DHT.\n\nFinally, excessive masturbation depletes your body of certain nutrients and minerals, such as zinc\u2026 in addition to cerebrospinal fluid. Which can result in accelerated aging, hair loss and impotence.4\n\nAgain, the problem here is a negative change in your hormones5 \u2026 And in a minute I\u2019ll give you some natural solutions to fix this, but before I do \u2013 I want to finally discuss the difference between:\n\nOrgasms by masturbation vs. intercourse\n\nAt the end of all this, you may be thinking \u201cso orgasms are good, excessive masturbation could be bad \u2013 but, what about \u201cexcessive intercourse\u201d \u2014 will it have the same problems?\u201d\n\nActually, it won\u2019t and here\u2019s why\u2026\n\nPeople who are \u201cexcessively\u201d masturbating \u2026 daily or multiple times a day are never going to be having that much sex. And if they are, they are \u201csex addicts\u201d and thus, they have other issues.\n\nWhen you\u2019re having intercourse, there are lots of other things going on that are beneficial \u2014 being touched, eye contact, communication, smelling, communicating, etc.. and the fact that it\u2019s REAL and not something \u201cfake\u201d, like watching porn \u2013 causes beneficial changes in your hormones.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Solution?\n\nSo now that I\u2019m near the end of today\u2019s article, you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cokay, so what\u2019s the solution here \u2013 I hope you\u2019re NOT going to ask me to STOP masturbating?!!\u201d\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not. But allow me to give you 3 solutions.\n\nFirst, I would suggest you REDUCE your masturbating.\n\nIt\u2019s like working out. You can\u2019t go to the gym every single day \u2013 it\u2019s not good for your health and it\u2019ll diminish your results and slow your progress because of negative changes in your hormones.\n\nYou need to have \u201coff days\u201d and sometimes, you need to take off a few days or maybe even a week to let your body recuperate and improve your hormones.\n\nSo, I suggest you do the same with masturbating. Practice some self-control and have pre-scheduled days OFF.\n\nSecondly, try masturbating without any porn. Watching porn is actually becoming a very big problem in society, especially for men\u2026 and it\u2019s causing a lot of negative issues as it pertains to sex, impotence and neurological changes in your brain.4\n\nLastly, make sure you\u2019re at least taking specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals which are designed to help replenish what you\u2019re losing in the orgasm, to help increase your testosterone levels and to reduce the negative hormones such as female and stress hormones.\n\nIt\u2019s just like working out .. you need to give your body what it\u2019s losing.\n\nAnd for this, I suggest you use a proven formula specifically designed for this \u2026 to help safely and naturally optimize your youth hormones.\n\nAnd if you have any form of erectile problems, this formula will surely help fix it.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.08030.x/full\n\nhttp://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/6/3/17\n\nhttps://www.essm.org/index.php?id=100\n\nhttp://neuropathology-web.org/chapter14/chapter14CSF.html\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/135817",

    "content": "Today I want to talk about lowering estrogen levels. This information is mainly for guys, but women can certainly utilize it as well.\n\nThis is also a two-part article series.\n\nIn this first part, you\u2019ll discover WHY having optimal estrogen levels is so important.\n\nThe second part reveals the HOW to lower estrogen and I\u2019ll give you that link at the end of this article.\n\nI care about you and I want you to learn from my mistakes this is why I want you to have knowledge about your body and health and this first part will give you this vital information.\n\nI wish someone would have told me all of these years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, most experts get this stuff all wrong \u2013 including the doctors.\n\nNow\u2026 I\u2019m going to share something personal with you \u2014 most people don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve been on some kind of estrogen inhibitor for about 30 years now, starting at age 19.\n\nI have a TON of experience with this topic, with man boobs (gynecomastia), mood changes, sex drive highs and lows, and so forth.\n\nSo you better pay attention if your goal is to improve your estrogen levels, which will ALSO improve your other hormones \u2013 thus, increasing your testosterone levels!\n\nThis is an important topic because estrogen levels are much higher now than 25 years ago, 50 and certainly 100 years ago due to our environments (food, lifestyle, stress, etc.) and as well as just genetics.\n\nYou see, the problem is that estrogen is directly linked to both breast AND prostate health problems.\n\nSo, if you want to help avoid health problems \u2013 pay close attention right now.\n\nAnd guys, if you are concerned about \u201cman boobs\u201d (gynecomastia), low sex drive, muscle size, belly fat, and even your mood and happiness \u2013 then you really better read today\u2019s article to the very end.\n\nAdditionally, at the end of this article, I\u2019ve got links to proven ways of improving your other hormones. So, make sure you check that out at the end of this article.\n\nEstrogen Is Bad, Not Testosterone\n\n\u201cOld\u201d research, doctors and the media will say that testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the cause of prostate problems. But this is totally wrong.\n\nTestosterone is GOOD for your health and prostate.\n\nIt\u2019s ESTROGEN that\u2019s bad.\n\nIn fact, as your estrogen levels go up, your body\u2019s natural estrogen inhibitor, DHT \u2013 also goes up to try and bring estrogen down.\n\nAnd if you recall, DHT (dihydrotestosterone) is linked to hair loss, excess body hair, and prostate problems.\n\nSo again, the fault is and begins with estrogen\u2026\n\nWomen & Breast Health\n\nIn regards to women who have breast health problems, they get prescribed an estrogen BLOCKER such as Nolvadex (Tamoxifen). Now, this is an old drug and was utilized more so in the past.\n\nThese days, you would get prescribed an estrogen INHIBITOR and more specifically, an \u201caromatase inhibitor\u201d.\n\nI know I\u2019m talking about women and breasts \u2013 but guys, this information directly affects your prostate, as well as your libido, muscle size, belly fat, hair loss, and mood.\n\nSo please pay attention\u2026\n\nEstrogen Blocker vs Inhibitor\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference between an estrogen blocker and an inhibitor?\n\nA blocker goes to the receptor sites, such as the breast tissue and nipples, and blocks estrogen from binding. Again, I\u2019m keeping it simple because it\u2019s more complicated than this.\n\nA blocker does NOT lower circulating estrogen levels, it just blocks it at the receptor site.\n\nHowever, an estrogen inhibitor actually lowers total estrogen levels. It inhibits the formation. It prevents testosterone from converting to estrogen (estradiol) by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.\n\nTHIS is what you want!\n\nBy lowering total circulating estrogen/estradiol levels, you will automatically increase testosterone levels. So, this is a side benefit.\n\nThink of estrogen as an expense. And testosterone as revenue.\n\nLess expense (estrogen) = more money (testosterone) for you.\n\nBut Estrogen Has Benefits\n\nNow, the problem with prescription aromatase/estrogen inhibitors \u2013 such as Arimidex, Femara, and Aromasin \u2013 is that they lower estrogen levels TOO much. Usually by 80-90% or more.\n\nHowever, this is what these breast drugs are designed to do \u2013 kill off almost all the estrogen to starve the tumor and shrink it.\n\nBut remember, there are NO \u201cbad\u201d hormones in the body. It\u2019s all about balance and ratios.\n\nWomen are much more sensitive to estrogen and thus, lowering it by 90% with a drug will make them feel like crap.\n\nIt\u2019s also unhealthy for bone mass, cholesterol and lipid levels, skin, hair, brain function, mood, and so on.\n\nAnd when guys lower it too much, they become very tired, everything aches on them, they lose their sex drive, become weaker in the gym, develop mood issues, and have lots of other problems.\n\nSo, the goal is not to have no or low estrogen levels \u2013 which is what these drugs do.\n\nYou obviously also do not want high estrogen levels.\n\nWhat you want to do is have normal levels but on the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nIdeal Estradiol Levels\n\nFor example, if you do a blood test and check for estradiol levels, a typical range will be between 8-43 pg/mL.\n\nI\u2019ve seen many guys who have numbers around 35 and higher. Many times even over 43, which is the high range. These may be \u201cnormal\u201d, but they are high/normal and not optimal.\n\nYou want the levels to be between 10-20 pg/mL. Remember, the range is 8-43.\n\nIf you have high testosterone levels, then you can have higher estrogen closer to 20 pg/mL. If you have lower testosterone levels, then your estradiol should be around 10 and the low tens.\n\nBut many times I see guys have lower testosterone and higher estradiol. All are within the \u201cnormal\u201d range, but this would be totally out of balance, not ideal or optimal.\n\nIt\u2019s the OPPOSITE of what you want.\n\nThus, it\u2019s like having high expenses and very low profit.\n\nHow To Lower Estrogen Naturally\n\nSo, this brings up the topic of how to lower estrogen levels naturally, to a healthy range \u2013 because we do NOT want to take drugs. As stated, they are too strong and riddled with lots of negative effects.\n\nNow, in part two of this article series \u2013 this is what I\u2019ll be discussing.\n\nHowever, I made this intro article to educate you. YOU need to be in charge of your health. Don\u2019t listen to your doctor or anyone else blindly.\n\nSo I hope with this article you learned something important and the WHY behind having optimal estrogen levels.\n\nNow, let\u2019s go to part 2 and discover HOW to lower it, naturally\u2026\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "This is part two of my \u201chigh estrogen is evil\u201d article series.\n\nIn part one, I discussed WHY you need to manage and lower your levels to an optimal range. It\u2019s very important you read that article if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nI\u2019ve also got a link on proven ways of improving your hormones, such as higher testosterone levels for us guys.\n\nWhen it comes to foods that increase or decrease estrogen levels, it gets really complicated and confusing.\n\nThe SAME food can be listed in the \u201cdecrease\u201d and \u201cincrease\u201d estrogen lists. It makes no sense.\n\nFor example, soy \u2013 does it increase or decrease estrogen levels? Same with cruciferous vegetables and mushrooms.\n\nI\u2019ve read studies that say both.\n\nBut when you dig deeper into the research, you start to see all the flaws. Sometimes it was based on the dose. A small amount lowered it, but more of the food increased it.\n\nSometimes it had to do with the sex and age of the person. For example, post-menopausal women get totally different results than non-menopausal women\u2026 and men get different results than both groups.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve simplified all of this for you by going through all the research and of course, adding 30 years of personal experience with estrogen inhibitors.\n\nYES, as stated in the first article, I\u2019ve been on some sort of estrogen inhibitor for about 30 years, since the age of 19.\n\nI had naturally higher estrogen levels and had puffy nipples all through high school\u2026 like small gynecomastia.\n\nMine was obviously genetics, combined with the American diet.\n\nWhat To Avoid \u2013 These Increase Estrogen\n\nThere are lots of things that can act as estrogen (phytoestrogen or xenoestrogen) in your body or simply increase your levels.\n\nAt this point, who cares what the cause is, let\u2019s just remove these estrogen-causing substances!\n\nAnd what I\u2019m going to list, is based on my own personal experience, as well as consulting hundreds of people, and examining their diets and blood tests.\n\nSo, I have a lot of pattern recognition at this point.\n\nThis is one of those mixed foods that the research says it increases or decreases estrogen. I say it INCREASES it.\n\nStay away from soy, especially anything that\u2019s GMO. So, forget the tofu, soy milk, soy protein powders, and so forth.\n\nIf you want to have some organic edamame \u2013 go for it. But none of the man-made soy products.\n\nEat foods in their original, NATURAL state.\n\nThis is a major area of increasing estrogen levels or basically mimicking it in the body.\n\nMany cosmetic products, soaps, and fragrances have these bad chemicals, such as:\n\nTriclosan (found in hand sanitizer)\n\nThere are a lot more, you should do a search online. But sunscreens are a major problem and this is why I\u2019ve highlighted them in red because so many people use them.\n\nTwo plastics that are really bad are:\n\nStyrene \u2013 a widely used plastic for food packaging\n\nBisphenol-A (BPA): the WORST \u2013 found to activate aromatase, lower progesterone effect, bind and activate estrogen. Found in most water bottles.\n\nAgain, read the package and labels.\n\nMost protein sources these days are from animals that are overly fat, unhealthy, fed the wrong foods (grains and corn), and doped up on steroids and antibiotics. Thus, the meat and milk of these animals are full of estrogen that you are consuming.\n\nSo my suggestion is to avoid ALL dairy.\n\nThe only good protein sources I like are grass-fed bison, wild-caught salmon, pasture-raised whole eggs, and non-GMO white rice protein for vegans.\n\nEat less quantity protein, but higher quality protein.\n\nIt\u2019ll cost the same and you\u2019ll look and feel much better.\n\nWhat To Eat \u2013 These Lower Estrogen\n\nThere are lots of foods that claim to lower estrogen \u2013 however, these are the most powerful ones.\n\nThese help block estrogens. The best are broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, and collard greens.\n\nSome of them act as aromatase inhibitors. White Button Mushrooms are the best. You can also take the extract form as a supplement. You need about 100 mgs daily of the 10:1 extract.\n\nOne of my favorite fruits is organic, red grapes. They contain Resveratrol, which helps lower estrogen. Also, eating the seeds is even more potent, so don\u2019t eat the seedless grapes.\n\nKeep in mind that grapes are high in sugar. And do NOT drink grape juice, it\u2019ll shoot up your blood sugar \u2013 as well as red wine.\n\nHave the whole grapes, including the seeds.\n\nYou can also take Resveratrol as a supplement. Get 95% extract at 250 mgs daily. I take about a gram daily, but it is expensive.\n\nAnother favorite fruit of mine. It also lowers estrogen and has many other health benefits, such as lowering blood pressure.\n\nJust like grapes, eat it all including the seeds.\n\nDo NOT drink the juice, it\u2019ll increase blood sugar.\n\nSo, let\u2019s put together a simple action plan now:\n\nFrom the foods to avoid, see which you can reduce. Just pick one. I\u2019d start with dairy if you consume that.\n\nFrom the foods to eat, see which you can add in. Just pick one. I\u2019d start with some cruciferous vegetables. I think Broccoli and broccoli sprouts are one of the best.\n\nTake specific herbs and vitamins that are clinically proven to lower estrogen and improve your testosterone levels. This takes NO effort, so you have no excuse. I\u2019ve got links to this below.\n\nThere you have it, 3 simple steps. The last one is the easiest.\n\nTake action now, while it\u2019s fresh on your mind!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Testofen\u00ae is a specialized form of fenugreek extract standardized for 50% Fenuside.\n\nTestofen\u00ae has multiple clinical studies that support1\n\nhealthy sexual desire and vitality*\n\nAn increase in free testosterone levels\n\nhelps reduce normal symptoms of Andropause in men.*\n\nTestofen\u00ae main \u201cclaim to fame\u201d is the fact it can increase \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels significantly, by \u201c100% more\u201d and thus, potentially doubling free testosterone levels.2\n\nIt achieves this effect by interacting with aromatase and 5-alpha reductase enzymes, blocking the enzymes without activating them.\n\nSimply stated, your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone will increase because Testofen\u00ae lowers the \u201cfemale hormone\u201d estrogen and the \u201chair loss\u201d hormone, DHT.\n\nUnfortunately, in the \u201creal world,\u201d it doesn\u2019t seem to work so well when used by itself.\n\nHowever, in a minute I\u2019ll show you a simple way to make Testofen\u00ae work much better and it\u2019ll save you money at the same time.\n\nDifference Between Total & \u201cFree\u201d Testosterone\n\nAs you may already know, testosterone is the primary hormone that controls your libido, \u201cdrive\u201d, mental happiness, increased muscle, decreased fat, and an overall improved sense of well-being.\n\nUnfortunately, over 95% of your \u201ctotal\u201d testosterone is \u201cbound\u201d to various proteins in your blood. So most of it is \u201cinactive\u201d.\n\nThus, only 5% or less is \u201cfree\u201d to travel around your body and work its magic.\n\nThink of your \u201ctotal\u201d testosterone as your GROSS income and your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone as your NET income \u2014 the money you get to keep after all your expenses and taxes.\n\nThus, what we care most about is increasing your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels, which is what Testofen\u00ae can help with.\n\nHow Will You Benefit \u2013 Results?\n\nAny time you increase your testosterone levels, you *should* feel an increase in your libido, drive, mental happiness, more muscle, less fat, and an overall improved sense of well-being.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not like a steroid or taking testosterone injections. It all happens naturally, from within your own body, and thus, fewer side-effects and it\u2019s easy to maintain long-term.\n\nSide-Effects & Warnings\n\nNow, I\u2019ve utilized Testofen\u00ae by itself on numerous patients and clients, including myself. Yes, there was an improvement in testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, I never saw it \u201cdouble\u201d with anyone or even come close. It only \u201cdoubled\u201d when I \u201cstacked\u201d it with other ingredients and I\u2019ll tell you more about this in a minute.\n\nAdditionally, for many people, I had to use double or triple the recommended dosage to see the positive effects. Which made using Testofen\u00ae very expensive.\n\nAlso during my testing, there were people who felt no improvements at all, even though there WAS an improvement in their testosterone levels.\n\nNow, there is a \u201csimple\u201d way to make Testofen\u00ae work much better and at a lower dosage, and I\u2019ll show you how in a minute.\n\nThe second problem I\u2019ve seen over and over again is when using only ONE ingredient to achieve a health goal \u2014 such as Testofen\u00ae in today\u2019s example\u2026. Is that your body will quickly adapt to it.\n\nThus, it stops working after a couple of weeks.\n\n\u2026 and this is natural because that\u2019s how the human body works. The survival mechanism is to \u201cadapt and grow\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, as your body adapts, you have to use a higher dosage in which after a few weeks your body adapts AGAIN and now you have to increase the dosage even more.\n\nThis gets very expensive and can lead to negative side effects eventually.\n\nHowever, if you use a \u201cstacking\u201d tactic \u2013 which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute, you\u2019ll dramatically reduce the adaptation and improve the effectiveness, WITHOUT having to increase the dosage.\n\nThe final challenge is that your goal isn\u2019t to only increase your testosterone.\n\nThis is because as you age, your body creates various enzymes that convert testosterone to \u201cnegative\u201d hormones, such as estrogen, prolactin, DHT, cortisol, etc.\n\nAll of these \u201cconversions\u201d DECREASE your positive testosterone and INCREASE these negative hormones. Which is NOT what you want.\n\nSo your \u201chigh testosterone\u201d quickly comes back down again. This is why people stop feeling the positive effects after a couple of weeks.\n\nWhat you want to do is increase your testosterone and KEEP IT HIGH, by preventing and stopping the conversions to these \u201cnegative\u201d hormones.\n\nAnd to accomplish this goal, we\u2019ll need to use other ingredients which help BLOCK these conversions, naturally \u2013 and I\u2019ll show you how in a minute.\n\nHow To Make Testofen Work Better\n\nTo prevent \u201cadaptation\u201d and make Testofen\u00ae work better, we\u2019re going to \u201cstack\u201d it with other complementary ingredients.\n\nWhen dealing with professional athletes and the various drugs they use, the BEST way to maximize positive effects and minimize negative side-effects is to \u201cstack\u201d.\n\nStacking means you use multiple compounds together (herbs, vitamins, etc.), rather than only ONE single compound by itself.\n\nThe special synergy between the correct \u201cstack of ingredients\u201d, creates a much safer and more effective solution.\n\nIt\u2019s like 1+1+1 = 6 (not 3!) You use less, and you get more.\n\nThe \u201cstack\u201d saves you money and gives you better, safer results, for a longer amount of time.\n\nTo prevent testosterone from converting to negative hormones, you\u2019ll want to use natural ingredients such as\n\nDIM reduces the female hormone, estrogen\n\nVitamin C and Ashwagandha reduce the stress hormone, cortisol\n\nVitex Agnus to reduce the female hormone, prolactin\n\nZinc to reduce the hair loss and prostate problems hormone, DHT\n\nThese ingredients, when mixed with a few other clinically proven herbs, will increase your testosterone and keep it high, naturally!\u2026 similar to when you were young.\n\nSummary & Your Best Option\n\nSo Testofen\u00ae works by increasing your total and \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels.\n\nTo prevent \u201cadaptation\u201d and \u201cconversions\u201d to negative hormones, you\u2019ll want to \u201cstack\u201d it with other synergistic ingredients.\n\nIn the end, you\u2019ll get better results, it\u2019s safer for you and you\u2019ll save money at the same time.\n\nNow, to optimize all of this and use the correct, clinically proven ingredients at the right dosages, just take a look at the exclusive link and get more details\u2026\n\nPlus, you\u2019ll discover one of my favorite, all-natural solutions that I personally use for boosting testosterone levels, and increasing libido and muscle mass.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/can-l-citrulline-be-the-solution-for-erectile-dysfunction/",
    "content": "Let\u2019s start with today\u2019s subscriber question:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam, I wanted to know if l-citrulline works for fixing erection problems or is it just another scammy supplement? And if it does work, what\u2019s the best way to take it \u2013 dose, timing, etc.?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re correct in that most supplements do NOT work and are \u201cscammy\u201d.\n\nTo answer your question, YES \u2013 L-citrulline can work in improving erection strength. I don\u2019t think it will \u201cfix\u201d it, but it can help.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ll tell you in a minute the ONLY real way to fix erectile problems.\n\nAnyway, today I\u2019ll quickly cover:\n\nWhat l-citrulline is.\n\nThe correct way to use it \u2013 dosing and timing.\n\nHow to make it work much better, so it\u2019s more effective.\n\nAnd the primary cause of erectile problems, how to REALLY fix it and where and how L-citrulline fits into all of this.\n\nWhat L-citrulline Is?\n\nL-citrulline is an amino acid that\u2019s normally produced in the body.\n\nSo, your goal is to get it from external sources.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s very little of it found in food. However, watermelon has the highest amount of L-citrulline than any other food. Even though, it\u2019s still very little.\n\nThus, the best way to get it is through a supplement.\n\nHow L-citrulline Works?\n\nL-citrulline works by increasing nitric oxide (NO), which is a gas that helps dilate blood vessels and improves blood flow.\n\nThis is very important for heart and brain health. It helps improve blood pressure levels.\n\nAnd, as a side benefit, the increase in nitric oxide also helps improve erections.\n\nBy the way, on a side note, having erectile problems is an early warning sign of potential heart problems.\n\nSo, as much as you want to help fix this problem to have better sex, it\u2019s even more important to fix erectile problems so you don\u2019t have a heart attack or stroke and DIE!\n\nSomething interesting that you may not know is that Sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, works by increasing Nitric Oxide levels. However, it was originally designed for lowering blood pressure.\n\nAgain, the SIDE benefit of Viagra that the researchers heard from the users was better erections. And selling it as an erection drug made Pfizer billions of dollars\u2026 Much more than selling it as a blood pressure drug.\n\nBy the way, the same drug Sildenafil, is sold for lowering blood pressure under the tradename of \u201cRevatio\u201d. Same drug, but much cheaper than selling it as Viagra.\n\nAnyway\u2026 let\u2019s continue with citrulline.\n\nL-citrulline & Arginine\n\nNow, L-citrulline works because your body converts it to another amino acid called, L-arginine \u2013 which I\u2019m sure you may have heard about.\n\nIt\u2019s the L-arginine that technically increases nitric oxide levels.\n\nSo, you may be wondering, \u201cWhy even bother taking l-citrulline, when you can just take l-arginine to begin with\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s true, since both are available as supplements. In fact, in the old days that\u2019s what we did \u2013 we just took L-arginine since L-citrulline wasn\u2019t available yet.\n\nWell, the research shows that L-citrulline may increase levels of L-arginine in your body more than supplementing with L-arginine itself does. This is because a large percentage of L-arginine is broken down in your gut before reaching your bloodstream.\n\nThus, taking l arginine isn\u2019t the best method and more so, a big waste of money.\n\nSome people combine both citrulline and arginine together.\n\nPersonally, I think just taking citrulline is all you need.\n\nHowever, there is another supplement you can take with citrulline that\u2019ll make it much more potent and I\u2019ll talk about that one in a minute.\n\nAs far as the correct dose, it\u2019s anywhere from 500 mg to as much as 5 grams or 5,000 mg.\n\nMy suggestion is to start low and build up and see how your body responds.\n\nI think it\u2019s best to take citrulline or any single amino acid on an empty stomach so it doesn\u2019t compete with other amino acids found in protein.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re using citrulline for better erections, take it about 30 minutes before intercourse. It has about a 60-minute half-life, so that\u2019s enough time to get into your system and stay active during sex.\n\nPrimary Cause Of Erectile Problems\n\nOne important thing to keep in mind is if you\u2019re not getting the improved erections that you want, with or without a nitric oxide product, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t addressed the PRIMARY problem or cause or erectile dysfunction and that is hormonal imbalance and more specifically, low testosterone levels.\n\nYou see, Nitric Oxide \u2013 whether in supplement form or taking a drug like Viagra or Cialis, works dramatically better when your testosterone levels are high.\n\nIn fact, in about 40% of users who have sub-optimal testosterone levels, these supplements or drugs do NOT work very well or at all.\n\nInterestingly, higher testosterone levels also increase nitric oxide production naturally from within.\n\nThe best and fastest ways to increase your testosterone, naturally is a solution I\u2019ve been using myself for over 20+ years.\n\nIt\u2019s an all-in-one supplement called, AlphaViril.\n\nMake It Better & More Effective\n\nRemember earlier I said there\u2019s a way to make citriline work better?\u2026. Actually, there are two ways.\n\nThe first is to use L-citrulline with Pine Bark Extract (97%). This is because Pine Bark Extract helps promote endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).\n\nThis is the enzyme required to make nitric oxide. It interacts with Citrulline to sustain nitric oxide levels sufficient for long-term sexual function, performance and duration.\n\nMost people don\u2019t know this and it\u2019s really important because as we age, the body produces less of eNOS enzyme and thus, why Nitric Oxide enhancing products such as Citrulline or even drugs like Viagra or Cialis don\u2019t work as well.\n\nIn fact, this is why the supplement AlphaViril is so effective. Not only does it have multiple testosterone boosters in it, but AlphaViril also has Nitric Oxide producers such as L-Citrulline and Pine Bark Extract.\n\nYes, it costs a little more, but this is exactly why it works so well and has a 22+ year proven track record.\n\nI know today\u2019s topic was very detailed and had many important points. So, let me quickly summarize it for you and then you can also rewatch it again later.\n\nL-Citrulline is an amino acid that works by increasing Nitric Oxide levels.\n\nNitric Oxide improves blood flow and it\u2019s very important for your brain, heart and yes \u2013 your penis for better erections.\n\nL-CItrulline or any ingredient that works by increasing Nitric Oxide levels \u2013 such as arginine, Viagra or Cialis \u2013 should be taken with an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enhancer, such as 97% Pine Bark Extract.\n\nThe dose of Citrulline should be as little as 500 mg to as high as 5000 mg.\n\nI suggest taking it on an empty stomach, away from other amino acids found in protein.\n\nMore importantly, it\u2019s best to FIRST focus on the real cause of erectile problems and that\u2019s hormonal imbalances and having low total and free testosterone levels.\n\nI suggest you take AlphaViril because it has numerous testosterone-boosting ingredients, plus 2 ingredients that help increase nitric oxide and that\u2019s Citrulline and Pine Bark Extract.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is going to be about using an herb called Horny Goat Weed, also known as Epimedium, for naturally increasing your libido and sex drive. And I\u2019ll quickly go over some reviews, facts, and health warnings.\n\nHow Effective Is Horny Goat Weed For Increasing Your Libido & Sex Drive?\n\nHorny Goat Weed (Epimedium) is a pungent ornamental herb.\n\nLegend has it that the name \u201chorny goat weed\u201d came from a herder who noticed his goats becoming more sexually active after eating the plant.\n\nThe use of Epimedium as a medicinal herb dates back to at least 400 A.D\u2026 where it has been used as a tonic for the reproductive system, boosting libido and treating impotence, and as a rejuvenating tonic (to relieve fatigue).\n\nDecrease Cortisol & Increase Testosterone\n\nHorny Goat Weed is thought to work via modulation of cortisol levels (the primary stress hormone). Under conditions of high stress, the increased cortisol levels are known to cause\n\nand Lower Testosterone Levels\n\nIt is also thought to help restore normal metabolism, energy levels, and libido.\n\nIt is interesting to note that although at least fifteen active components have been identified in epimedium extracts, the specific icariin extract (found here) is noted for stimulation of the sex drive and reduction of cortisol levels.\n\nAgain, make sure the product is PURE EXTRACT, NOT powder or root, and at least 30%. Anything less, and you\u2019re wasting money, and you\u2019ll have to double and triple your dose.\n\nHorny Goat Weed Warnings and \u201cScams\u201d\n\nThere are always potential \u201cnegatives\u201d.\n\nEven though Horny Goat Weed is a NATURAL substance, it doesn\u2019t have negative side-effects when used correctly, unlike prescription drugs.\n\nBut when used at high dosages (1000 mg or more), it may cause side-effects in some people:\n\nThe higher the dose, the worse the side-effects.\n\nSecret To Reducing The Negatives\n\nThe SECRET to reducing/eliminate negative side-effects is to make sure you ONLY take pure extracts containing the active components, which is 30% of Icariin Epimedium Sagitattum.\n\nDo NOT take the dry \u201croot\u201d, which is just dead herbs and it\u2019s worthless.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/do-oats-oatmeal-lower-sex-drive-testosterone-levels/",
    "content": "I recently did a popular article about oats, entitled, \u201cHealth Warnings About Eating Oats/Oatmeal, Especially For Breakfast!\u201d. I\u2019ll give you a link to that article at the end of this one.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is within 48 hours, I had 3 separate guys contacting me \u2013 in Facebook or email \u2013 asking me:\n\n\u201cWhy do I see a decrease in sex drive when I consume oats regularly?\u201d\n\nAnother person asked, \u201cI think eating oatmeal in the morning is killing my libido, can this be true?\u201d\n\nThe last person asked, \u201cI swear to you, my testosterone feels lower when I have lots of oats. Any studies showing this Dr. Sam?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019ll discuss today:\n\nif oats are a problem\n\nwhat I discovered in hormone tests\n\na specific oat that\u2019s clinically proven to increase your testosterone and libido\n\nI stated how this was interesting because years ago when I used to consult and coach a lot of professional athletes, including bodybuilders, I had a few guys tell me similar things.\n\nIf it was a regular person, I wouldn\u2019t give it as much thought because there are too many variables that regular people don\u2019t take into account.\n\nBut these guys were professionals and thus, they lived a stricter lifestyle and were very detailed and calculated in everything they did \u2013 ate, slept, exercised, supplements, drugs, and so forth.\n\nSo, I had to take it seriously because something was negatively affecting their mood and performance. And thus, I did hormone tests on these guys whenever it was possible \u2013 both blood and saliva.\n\nInterestingly, they almost all had elevated cortisol and lower testosterone levels. There was an imbalance and the ratio was far from optimal.\n\nJust so that you know, as your stress hormone cortisol goes up, your testosterone levels will come down.\n\nAnd this imbalance could easily be the cause of the lowered sex drive, libido, performance, and so forth.\n\nWas this due to eating oats?\u2026 I have no idea because I don\u2019t have enough data or people.\n\nCould this have been the case with my other athletes who did NOT eat oats?\u2026 Again, I have no idea because I wasn\u2019t doing some randomized clinical study, doing hormone tests on dozens of people.\n\nWas it because they had an allergic reaction to the oats, which will cause inflammation and a rise in cortisol?\u2026 Yes, possibly.\n\nThe bottom line is that I don\u2019t know for sure.\n\nI can\u2019t say anything with certainty because I don\u2019t have hundreds of people saying the same thing, to make any conclusive decisions \u2013 whether it\u2019s empirical or clinical.\n\nThere are just too many factors.\n\nHowever, IF you feel like eating oats or any foods causes a decrease in your libido and sex drive or some other negative physical, emotional, or mental issue\u2026 then my suggestion is you STOP doing it for a couple of weeks and see how you feel.\n\nIf you feel better, then good. We discovered something important.\n\nThen reintroduce it back into your diet and see how you feel. If things go bad again, then I think we know for sure that you must eliminate this specific food from your diet.\n\nThis can be oats or any macro or micronutrient.\n\nFor whatever reason \u2013 your genetics, age, hormones, etc. \u2013 your body doesn\u2019t like it. Which is fine.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is you LISTEN to your body \u2013 it\u2019ll tell you what you need to do.\n\nOf course, paying attention and listening is the hard part.\n\nWhat About Clinical Studies?\n\nBefore I end today\u2019s topic, I also did a quick search on PubMed about clinical studies linking oats to testosterone or cortisol levels, libido and so forth. Nothing good came up.\n\nAnd even if it did, any study can be refuted with an opposite study.\n\nHowever, there is ONE important fact that came up in my research numerous times. About a specific type of oat that RAISES total and free testosterone levels.\n\nThink of your total testosterone as your GROSS income. And your \u201cfree testosterone\u201d as your NET income. What you keep after taxes and expenses.\n\nThus, they both matter, but your FREE testosterone levels matter more \u2013 that\u2019s the active, usable testosterone.\n\nAnyway, this specific form of oat is called Oat Straw Extract, also known as Avena Sativa Extract.\n\nYou can\u2019t get this from food, I\u2019ve tried \u2013 it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nIt needs to come in a specific supplement form, extract with a 100:1 ratio.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ve put a link to a product that contains this exact form of Oat Straw/Avena Sativa Extract. It\u2019s actually something I\u2019ve been using myself for over 20 years.\n\nIt also contains about a dozen other clinically researched natural ingredients that help balance and optimize your hormones by\n\nIncreasing total and free testosterone levels\n\nDecreasing negative hormones (estrogen, cortisol, etc.)\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re interested in more details about all of this and how to improve your libido and so forth \u2013 just click on this special link.\n\nI\u2019m also sharing the link to the original article \u201cHealth Warnings About Eating Oats/Oatmeal, Especially For Breakfast!\u201d\n\nRemember, always listen to YOUR body. Just because someone else can eat one food or follow a specific diet and look or feel better, doesn\u2019t mean YOUR genetics are the same.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/varicocele-low-testosterone-shrinkage-infertility/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve gotten well over 25-30 questions about Varicocele in 2025, so I wanted to do an article about it because it\u2019s more common than you\u2019d think.\n\nIt typically affects about 15% of adult males and around 20% of adolescent males and teenagers.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll even share with you my own personal story about this in a couple of minutes. Something that I\u2019ve only told about 3-4 people. So make sure you keep reading.\n\nFirst, Varicocele is basically \u201cscrotum varicose veins\u201d. It\u2019s an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum.\n\nSo, it\u2019s similar to regular varicose veins you have, typically seen on the legs for example. And at the end of today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll give you a link to another article specifically about treating varicose veins.\n\nVaricocele can be a more serious problem because it can cause low sperm production, decreased sperm quality, and mobility, which can cause infertility.\n\nIt can also cause lowered testosterone levels due to a decrease in testicular size.\n\nIn fact, Varicocele is present in up to 45% of men with primary infertility and up to a whopping 80% of men with secondary infertility.\n\nWhat Causes Varicocele?\n\nBasically, blood isn\u2019t moving through the veins as it should, so there\u2019s a build-up of blood. Unfortunately, there is no specific reason or cause for Varicocele.\n\nHowever, in a minute I\u2019ll give you options for preventing and fixing it.\n\nSymptoms of Varicocele?\n\nAs far as the symptoms, there may not be any associated with it directly, but you may feel\n\nSwelling in your scrotum\n\nA lump in one of your testicles\n\nYou may see really large veins or twisted veins in your scrotum. Some describe it like a bag of worms.\n\nA dull pain, recurring or consistent\n\nHow To Diagnose Varicocele\n\nSo at this point, some of you may be touching your testicles and thinking, \u201chmm\u2026. I think I may have Varicocele\u201d \u2026 but, how would you know for sure?\n\nWell, you\u2019d go to your doctor and they can diagnose it. A general practitioner is fine, but a urologist is an ideal physician you want to see, if possible.\n\nThey can diagnose with a physical exam or if they\u2019re not sure, a scrotal ultrasound will give a definitive answer.\n\nHow To Treat Varicocele\n\nAs far as treatments, you may not have to, especially if your sperm production is fine or you\u2019re not trying to get anyone pregnant.\n\nHowever, if you have discomfort, pain or your testicles have shrunk, then I think it would be a good idea. Especially if you have lower testosterone levels.\n\nNow, as to how it should be treated or fixed \u2013 let me quickly share with you what happened to me.\n\nI was in 5th grade, so I was about 10 years old since I was younger than the other kids in the same grade. I remember walking into class, sitting down, and slowly I started to feel pain in my testicles. Within the next hour, the pain intensified. I could hardly sit down.\n\nIt was summertime because I remember I was wearing shorts.\n\nThe pain became so bad that I just got up and walked out of class.\n\nI had to take short, slow steps.\n\nI think the teacher asked, \u201cSammy, where are you going?\u2026\u201d\n\nBut I was in so much pain that I just zoned out and I started walking home. I didn\u2019t even think about going to the nurse or telling anyone, because it was in my testicles and I felt weird or embarrassed.\n\nLuckily, my home was about 3-4 blocks away. Not far. Typically, a 10-15 walk.\n\nBut not that day. I could barely walk. It took me like a freakin HOUR to get home. One small step at a time.\n\nWhen I got home I told my mom.\n\nOf course, she said, \u201coh my god, let me see\u201d.\n\nI refused. Again, I was embarrassed.\n\nI just said, \u201cplease take me to the hospital.\u201d\n\nOf course, like any good mother \u2013 she freaks out, got her purse, and we sped off to the hospital.\n\nTo make a long story short, the doctor had said that my veins in my scrotum had not only enlarged, but they got tangled up and that\u2019s why I was in so much pain.\n\nHe said there are two options.\n\nHave surgery, which is recommended.\n\nIce my testicles for the next few days, not move much and see what happens.\n\nWell, the last thing any young guy wants is a knife around these balls. So, I opted for the ice. And the truth is, I don\u2019t think we had money to even do surgery since we were broke.\n\nI went home and lay on the couch for the next week, icing my testicles daily. On and off, on and off.\n\nAnd luckily, things healed, the swelling went down, the veins untangled, and I was fixed. No surgery and I got to stay home from school.\n\nLuckily, I haven\u2019t had any issues since.f\n\nAnd thus, the treatment in such a severe case like mine is typically surgery, especially if you\u2019re older. I guess I was lucky that the ice worked.\n\nNeedless to say, surgery is the primary fix.\n\nHowever, as stated, surgery is only \u201cmedically\u201d necessary if you\u2019re in pain or if you\u2019re trying to have a child and show low sperm production due to the Varicocele.\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 you know something about me that I\u2019ve only shared with 3-4 people in my life.\n\nAnd before I end this article make sure you view my other article \u201cHow To Prevent, Reduce & Erase Varicose Veins\u201d.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/the-real-cause-of-prostate-growth-cancer-its-not-testosterone/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about the real cause of prostate problems.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just for men, but anyone who knows a man \u2013 such as your dad, brother, husband, boyfriend, and so forth.\n\nAt the end of this article, you\u2019ll know the exact cause and the best solutions for naturally avoiding prostate problems.\n\nAnd most importantly, increase your sex drive, you\u2019ll have harder, bigger, and fuller erections, and you\u2019ll live a longer and happier life.\n\nAnd the #1 killer in men in 2025 is prostate cancer \u2026 which is about 15% of men.\n\nI\u2019ve personally known multiple family members and friends\u2019 dads who have had prostate problems and sadly, died from it.\n\nMore so, most men will get diagnosed with an enlarged prostate, which is called BPH \u2013 which stands for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.\n\nSo, today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss the various causes of prostate problems, including the REAL cause of it.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been reading my articles, you\u2019ve probably heard me say numerous times that the way you look and feel is based on your genetics and hormones.\n\nSo, let\u2019s first start with genetics.\n\nA definite cause of any illness, is, of course, genetics and genetic mutations.\n\nThe good news is that even if you have the gene, it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll get the illness.\n\nThe bad news is that even if you do NOT have the gene, it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get the illness.\n\nAnd this is because there\u2019s something else called epigenetics that also controls gene expression. Thus, lifestyle can turn on or off various genes.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: You have a lot more control over your health than you think you do.\n\nSimilar to genetics, race, and ethnicity are also risk factors for prostate growth.\n\nFor example, black African Americans have the highest risk.\n\nWhile Latinos and Asian Americans have the lowest risk.\n\nBased on the hundreds of guys I\u2019ve consulted over the years, \u2026 looking at lifestyle, diet, blood tests, etc\u2026. The common factor I\u2019ve seen is HORMONES.\n\nWhich reinforces what I\u2019ve been saying for years \u2014 that genetics aside, the way you look and feel is based on your HORMONES!\n\nOf course, diet and food make a huge difference because it affects your hormones.\n\nAs Hippocrates wisely said over 2500 years ago, \u201clet food be thy medicine\u201d.\n\nThis basically means that food can act like a drug. A good or bad drug, depending on what you eat and how much.\n\nEven the timing of your food affects your hormones.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s talk about bad foods.\n\nDairy is definitely linked to health problems, including prostate problems. I\u2019ve said many times, that milk is for babies and cow milk is for baby cows.\n\nRed meat is also linked to prostate problems. Definitely, the processed junky red meat that most people are eating is the worst.\n\nHigh-fat animal protein is also a problem.\n\nAs are the cheap, supermarket vegetable and seed oils that are high in inflammatory omega-6 fats such as:\n\nBasically, these oils are used in most packaged foods.\n\nSo is a diet of highly processed carbohydrates and sugars, especially when mixed with fat.\n\nThe worst combination of food is high fat and carbs, which is all the yummy foods we eat and are also the most addictive.\n\nThose who exercise regularly have fewer prostate problems, up to 40% less. Unfortunately, most people barely move these days.\n\nThe good news is that all you need to get started is about 20 minutes of a brisk daily walk to get the benefits.\n\nGeographical Location\n\nWhere you live also plays a factor in your health and longevity, including prostate health.\n\nPeople living in warmer climates, closer to the equator, have fewer incidences of prostate problems.\n\nThey are probably more active and even more so, getting sunlight and that very valuable and awesome hormone called, Vitamin D.\n\nThat\u2019s right, Vitamin D is technically a steroid hormone and not a vitamin.\n\nAnd, that\u2019s why it has so many powerful and positive \u201csteroid-like\u201d benefits in your body \u2013 for both men and women.\n\nPeople who have higher body fat levels also have more prostate growth.\n\nFirst of all, belly fat, and more specifically visceral fat messes with your hormones.\n\nIt lowers the powerful testosterone, while it increases negative female hormones such as estradiol.\n\nHigh body fat also increases negative stress hormones such as cortisol.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s an increase in insulin levels, which causes even more hormonal imbalances.\n\nLastly, extra body fat increases inflammatory factors which then causes all sorts of health problems.\n\nThe Common Problem Is HORMONAL IMBALANCE\n\nThings always come back to your hormones and most specifically, hormonal IMBALANCES.\n\nMost idiot doctors still mistakenly think that testosterone is the cause of prostate problems.\n\nNot only is this medically wrong, but logically it makes no sense.\n\nYoung guys have the highest testosterone levels and have no prostate problems and have very low PSA scores, which is a major indicator of prostate problems.\n\nWhile older guys have lower testosterone levels and also, and that\u2019s when they have all the prostate problems.\n\nIn fact, the older the man, the lower the testosterone, and the bigger the prostate problems.\n\nHowever, there are 3 main hormones that are linked to prostate problems.\n\nNow, many of you have heard of the hormone, DHT \u2013 which stands for Dihydrotestosterone.\n\nThis is typically associated with prostate enlargement, hair loss and balding, and excess body hair.\n\nTestosterone gets converted to DHT due to higher levels of the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. Genetics plays a big role here.\n\nThe good news is you can lower DHT levels \u2013 with drugs and naturally.\n\nThe bad news is that you also don\u2019t want \u201clow\u201d levels or else you\u2019ll have no sex drive. This is the problem with guys who take Finasteride, which is known as Propecia or Proscar.\n\nSo we want higher testosterone and lower DHT.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another reason DHT levels go up\u2026 and that\u2019s to lower estrogen levels.\n\nThat\u2019s right, the second problem hormone is estrogen.\n\nYour body\u2019s natural estrogen inhibitor is DHT.\n\nIn fact, guys who have manboobs or gynecomastia can take topical DHT cream to lower estrogen levels and shrink their gyne.\n\nAnd thus, as estrogen levels go up, your body also increases DHT levels to try and lower estrogen.\n\nSo, the bigger problem is actually estrogen.\n\nWhich tends to go up due to age, body fat, and diet due to higher levels of the aromatase enzyme.\n\nAnd as estrogen goes up, testosterone comes down.\n\nSo again, we want higher testosterone and lower DHT and Estrogen levels.\n\nLastly, as stress hormones go up, such as cortisol, lots of negative health issues also increase \u2013 including prostate problems.\n\nBy the way, as DHT, estrogen, or cortisol levels go up, your total and free testosterone levels come down.\n\nAnd sadly, all 3 of these negative hormones go up with aging, and thus, why testosterone keeps going lower and lower as men get older.\n\nAnd THIS is why most doctors erroneously say that increasing testosterone will cause prostate problems.\n\nIt\u2019s not the testosterone, but what testosterone gets converted to \u2013 which is estrogen, DHT, and indirectly, cortisol.\n\nAnd now you know the REAL cause of prostate growth \u2013 which is hormonal imbalance.\n\nThus, you want higher total and free testosterone levels, while having lower DHT, estrogen, and cortisol levels \u2014 the same as you had when you were young.\n\nAgain, you want to replicate the natural hormone levels and ratios of a younger person, and NOT of an older person.\n\nSo, now that you know the problem and cause, what\u2019s the solution?\n\nWell, this article is longer than I had originally wanted.\n\nBut, I wanted to make sure you got all the correct information because I care about your health and future.\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to create a multi-part article series specifically about this topic and prostate health.\n\nI\u2019ve got a very important link where you can get more details on how to reduce prostate problems.\n\nAnd yes, this can all be done naturally.\n\nAnd NO, it will NOT affect your sex drive.\n\nIn fact, by applying what you\u2019ll discover in my articles \u2013 the exact opposite will happen \u2013 you\u2019ll have a higher libido and bigger, fuller, and harder erections.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostatecancer/detailedguide/prostate-cancer-what-causes https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/exposures/physical-activity https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/prevention-and-healthy-living/physical-activity-and-cancer-risk https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.311585 https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/body-fat-may-predict-aggressive-prostate-cancer https://www.pcf.org/c/body-fat-and-your-risk-of-dying-of-prostate-cancer/\n\nhttps://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer\n\nhttps://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostatecancer/detailedguide/prostate-cancer-what-causes\n\nhttps://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/exposures/physical-activity\n\nhttps://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/prevention-and-healthy-living/physical-activity-and-cancer-risk\n\nhttps://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.311585\n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/body-fat-may-predict-aggressive-prostate-cancer\n\nhttps://www.pcf.org/c/body-fat-and-your-risk-of-dying-of-prostate-cancer/",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about one of the most popular supplements used for prostate health and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): Saw Palmetto Extract.\n\nIf you\u2019re currently taking this ingredient or are thinking about using it \u2013 make sure you read this article because there could be some major side effects from it.\n\nAdditionally, at the end of today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll share with you another article I\u2019ve done about the exact causes AND solutions for shrinking your prostate and improving urinary flow, which ultimately can help you avoid prostate problems.\n\nRemember, this is a hormonal problem and thus, it CAN be fixed IF you know what to do, which is what you\u2019ll discover today.\n\nHistory Of Saw Palmetto\n\nI first heard about and started using Saw Palmetto in the late 1980s. I did so because I read about studies on how it helped increase testosterone levels, and decrease estrogens (the female hormone) and DHT (the balding hormone).\n\nThe side benefit was that it would be good at also preventing hair loss and prostate health (BPH). So, it was a win/win solution for us guys.\n\nI wanted to use it for improving my hormones, building more muscle, and so forth. And I wanted to give it to my dad to help with his prostate enlargement.\n\nAnd there were lots of studies about Saw Palmetto at that time, primarily based on an Italian prescription version of it called Permixon\u2122.\n\nThe good news was that you didn\u2019t need a prescription, nor go to Italy to get Permixon\u2122. It was available in the US at half the price, of its original herbal extract of Saw Palmetto Berry Extract (Serenoa repens).\n\nAnd the good news is that Permixon and thus, Saw Palmetto Extract (if you get the correct form and dosage), does work. It helps with prostate enlargement and improves your hormones.\n\nMy Personal Experience With Saw Palmetto\n\nIn fact, we did blood tests initially on me, my 2 brothers, and my dad. ALL of us showed improvements in our testosterone levels, while a decrease in DHT and Estrogen. Plus, my dad\u2019s PSA (prostate score) was also improved.\n\nExcept, for one main issue \u2013 ALL of us also had LOWER libido.\n\nWhich on paper, didn\u2019t make sense since your testosterone levels improved and the negative hormones decreased.\n\nWell, initially the sex drive did improve for the first week or two, but then it slowly decreased over time.\n\nAnother negative side-effect was the decrease in \u201cdrive\u201d for life. It was subtle, but I wasn\u2019t as driven, as energetic, as passionate.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain\u2026 I just felt a little more \u201cblah\u201d. I had less \u201cfire\u201d.\n\nMy brothers eventually stopped taking it because they also felt a slow decline in their libido. Whatever positives they may have gotten, weren\u2019t enough to justify continued use.\n\nBut, my dad and I still continued using Saw Palmetto extract.\n\nNow, I didn\u2019t talk about \u201csex\u201d or \u201clibido\u201d with my dad. But I do remember after a few months he said he reduced the dosage because he said he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel good on it\u201d. As he put it, \u201cI don\u2019t feel as manly.\u201d\n\nI got the point; I didn\u2019t ask for details.\n\nAnd eventually, he just stopped taking it as well.\n\nNow, I was young, so my hormones were still very good. So it didn\u2019t affect me as much. However, I remember I once ran out and I forgot to buy more and about a week later my libido just shot up and I finally realized it was the Saw Palmetto.\n\nOf course, not everyone feels the drop in sex drive from it. But, there are many complaints about this for sure. So, I wanted to share it with you because it is subtle, and over time, it gets worse and worse.\n\nSimilar to taking Proscar or Propecia, there are many guys who have lowered sex drive, but there are also lots of men who don\u2019t seem to complain about it.\n\nAll I can say is if you want to improve your prostate health, you can give Saw Palmetto a try and see how you feel. But be honest with yourself. Pay attention to how you feel and look.\n\nAlso, if you do try it, make sure it\u2019s the EXTRACT version at 85-95% extract. It should be 160 mg per 1 soft gel and the minimum dosage is 2 pills and thus, 320 mg daily.\n\nDo NOT get the \u201cpowder\u201d or \u201croot\u201d or \u201cberry\u201d versions, which typically come in a capsule, NOT a soft gel caplet. These \u201cpowdered\u201d versions are essentially dead \u2013 there are no active ingredients and it\u2019s a waste of money. It might have a higher mg dose, but it won\u2019t work.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad that Saw Palmetto does have this nasty side-effect, similar to Propecia/Proscar for many guys \u2013 just not as bad.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, there are always other solutions to a problem.\n\nIf you want to increase testosterone levels, there are other vitamins, minerals, and herbs without negative side effects.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Did you know that clinical depression affects 1 in 5 adults in the United States in 2025\u2026 that\u2019s 20% of the population.\n\nUnfortunately, sexual side effects are among the most common complaints about antidepressants \u2013 for both men and women.\n\nIn addition to sexual side effects, weight gain is another major complaint in up to 40% of antidepressant users.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Cause Of Low Sex Drive & Weight Gain?\n\nSo, what do lower libido and weight gain have in common?\u2026\n\nHormonal imbalance and more specifically, a decrease in testosterone levels, while simultaneously an increase in estrogen levels\u2026 which further decreases testosterone levels.\n\nAnd remember, testosterone is the key hormone in ALL animals, male and female, that controls libido, sex drive, muscle mass, strength, fat loss, and improved mood.\n\nLastly, one of the causes of the decrease in testosterone levels with the use of antidepressants is a decreased production in FSH and LH\u2026\n\nAnd for men, this means a decrease in testicular size and sperm production.\n\nIronically, an increase in testosterone levels acts as a natural antidepressant.\n\nSo this decrease in testosterone will actually FURTHER INCREASE negative feelings and depression.\n\nWhich Antidepressants Cause The Most Sexual Side Effects?\n\nThe following antidepressants are reportedly the most problematic:\n\nduloxetine (Cymbalta)\n\nescitalopram (Lexapro)\n\nparoxetine (Paxil and Paxil CR)\n\nWellbutrin (bupropion) tends to have lower sexual side effects than the other ones.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Solution?\n\nWell, I can\u2019t give you medical advice here\u2026 So, please speak to your doctor.\n\nHowever, I can report to you what\u2019s worked for many other people.\n\nLower The Dose Remember, drugs are SUPER powerful, a little goes a long way.\n\nChange Drug Not all drugs work exactly the same or affect you the same. For example, Wellbutrin seems to be the least likely to cause sexual problems and thus, a lowering of testosterone levels.\n\nTake Natural Solutions There are natural herbs and vitamins that also help improve serotonin levels and other neurotransmitters, that\u2019ll create a calming effect, happier feelings, more confidence, and control.\n\nHowever, they won\u2019t cause sexual side-effects because they work naturally WITH your body, unlike drugs that artificially work AGAINST your body.\n\nOne of the most popular mood-enhancing solutions is called ProVanax. It naturally helps balance important neurotransmitters, without the sexual side effects.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re a guy, you for sure want to improve your testosterone levels and balance your hormones\u2026 This will really make a huge difference and improvement in performance, sexual desire, and erections.\n\nAgain, my favorite and most popular solution is AlphaViril. It\u2019s an all-in-one solution that I\u2019ve personally been using for over 20+ years.\n\nThe good news is that both of these natural supplements are safe to take with antidepressants and SSRIs.\n\nOf course, you should always speak to your doctor first.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "So today it\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m going to talk again about masturbation. It\u2019s interesting how many questions I get asked about this topic.\n\nHowever, as I\u2019ve stated before, this blog is for YOU and I discuss topics that you\u2019re most interested in and have questions about.\n\nSo with that said, let\u2019s discuss today\u2019s question:\n\nDr. Sam \u2013 I heard and read that masturbation can shrink your penis, is this true? I masturbate about 3-5x daily, sometimes as often as 7x daily. I\u2019m worried. I don\u2019t want my penis to shrink. Hell, I want it to get bigger. Anyway, what\u2019s your thought?\n\nGrowing up, I never thought that masturbation would shrink my penis. I mean, this was never even talked about with my buddies. But these days, I get asked this question a ton of times for some reason.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the truth \u2013 YES, masturbation can cause your penis to shrink. Actually, let me rephrase that, excessive masturbation can cause shrinkage.\n\nOf course, the next question is, what\u2019s \u201cexcessive\u201d?\n\nWell, 4-7x daily is a lot. In fact, if you\u2019re masturbating that often, daily, every day \u2013 you need to get a job or something because you\u2019ve got way too much time on your hands.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve spoken about the \u201cWARNING: Negative Effects of Masturbation\u201d in another article.\n\nMasturbation Is Normal and Healthy, But\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s get something straight before I continue \u2013 masturbating is normal and healthy. Men and women do it. You\u2019ve seen dogs hump your leg or a toy, they do it too.\n\nAnd, when you\u2019re younger and have higher testosterone and optimal hormone levels, you\u2019re hornier and will masturbate or have sex, more often.\n\nAnd with that said, I think 1-2x daily is plenty.\n\nWhat\u2019s Excessive Masturbation?\n\nNow, another question you may be asking is \u201cwhy or how does excessive masturbating cause penis shrinkage?\u201d\n\nWell, it\u2019s very similar to working out.\n\nEven though your penis is an organ consisting of spongy tissue, it still contains muscle tissue \u2013 more specifically, smooth muscle. Not the same as your bicep or chest muscle, which is called skeletal muscle.\n\nNeedless to say, and even though it\u2019s not \u201cclinically proven\u201d, you can most certainly grow your penis and at the same time, shrink it.\n\nTRUST ME ON THIS, growing your penis is very possible and it happens plenty of times. It\u2019s been shown with lots of guys.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not going to talk about penis GROWTH today.\n\nHowever, excessive masturbating can lower testosterone levels and create hormonal imbalances, which can cause penis shrinkage.\n\nHow Often Should I Do It?\n\nIf you masturbate or have sex 1-2 daily, it\u2019s fine.\n\nBut if you do it many times daily and thus, \u201cexcessively\u201d, then you\u2019ll have hormonal imbalances many times during the day, all of which, over time, can cause penis shrinkage.\n\nAdditionally, just as LACK of use will cause shrinkage, so will OVER use.\n\nJust like going to the gym \u2013 you don\u2019t want to under or over-train if your goal is maximum muscle growth.\n\nRemember, everything in the body requires stimulation and recuperation if you want to progress.\n\nEven your brain \u2013 you need to learn something new daily, read more, and so forth to continue to build new brain cells, synapsis, and so forth. That\u2019s the stimulation.\n\nWhile at the same time, you need proper sleep, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals to help the brain recuperate and thus, remember what was learned to prevent memory and cognitive problems.\n\nYes, I\u2019m simplifying it all \u2013 but I hope you get the point.\n\nSo, stimulate your penis. Get erections. Do Kegel exercises. Have sex or masturbate. Have orgasms. Then, let it rest and recuperate.\n\nI guess like anything life, moderation is the key.\n\nLastly, you may be wondering \u201cwell, how much will it shrink if I masturbate excessively\u201d?\n\nI have no idea. Anecdotally, it\u2019s not much. More girth than length. Maybe half an inch or so, maybe more if you\u2019ve got more?\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about the shrinkage, it\u2019s about having optimal hormone levels so you perform at your best, now and in the future. It\u2019s about the penis and prostate health.\n\nSo, there you have it.\n\nStimulate, then recuperate.\n\nI\u2019ve got another article about this topic, that will help give you additional clarity.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "A while back I did a multi-part article series on hair loss \u2013 causes and solutions. I\u2019ll give you the direct link to those articles at the end of this one.\n\nHowever, I got asked a very important question the other day, one that many guys have asked me over the years about a popular hair loss drug. Tino emailed me and said\n\nI\u2019ve been taking Propecia for my hair loss for 2 years now. It has slowed down my hair loss and I\u2019ve seen benefits. But Dr. Sam \u2013 I really need your help. I don\u2019t feel good on it. First my sex drive is down and for sure can\u2019t perform like I used to. I have to work very hard at keeping my erection and it can be embarrassing at times. However, there\u2019s another problem \u2013 I feel down. I do not feel happy. I don\u2019t feel depressed, but I have no drive or anything anymore. Not in the bedroom or in life. Is there a way to fix this or do I have to get off the drug?\n\nActually, this is more common than you think. Merck, the manufacturer of Propecia and Proscar \u2013 has mentioned these negative side effects in their package inserts. There are also lots of websites and forums specific to these problems, such as PropeciaHelp.com and many others.\n\nThe active ingredient in Propecia and Proscar is finasteride. Propecia is 1 mg and Proscar is 5 mg. Propecia is prescribed for hair loss and Proscar for the prostate.\n\nBoth reduce DHT by acting as a type 2, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.\n\nAnd, there\u2019s a much stronger and better drug called Avodart, with the active ingredient dutasteride. It\u2019s both a type 2 AND type 1, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.\n\nAnd it blocks about 90%, while finasteride does about 70%.\n\nYET, through the past 2 decades of my studying this topic and clients, dutasteride users seem to have LESS side-effects than finasteride. It makes no sense, but it just seems to be the case. I don\u2019t know why.\n\nThe Problem With Propecia/Proscar\n\nNobody knows the exact reason why these drugs cause so many negative side-effects and the truth is, there is no ONE exact reason.\n\nBut after 2 decades and hundreds of blood tests \u2013 I\u2019ve seen the same pattern over and over again.\n\nFirst, you don\u2019t want low DHT, you just don\u2019t want \u201chigh\u201d DHT. Thus, in the middle range is ideal. When it gets on the lower levels or below normal, which these drugs cause, it negatively affects your drive \u2013 mental, physical, and sexual.\n\nThe other problem is as DHT comes down because of these 5-a reductase inhibitors, testosterone goes up, but temporarily \u2014 and then it comes back down because there\u2019s more testosterone to convert to estrogen via the aromatase enzyme.\n\nSo now, you have much higher estrogen \u2013 which causes negative emotional and sexual problems.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve noticed higher levels of another female hormone, prolactin. As prolactin goes up, your sex drive further comes down and so does your Dopamine levels. A powerful neurotransmitter that increases happiness and drive \u2013 both in life and in the bedroom.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s less blood flow due to lower levels of PDE-5 enzyme and Nitric Oxide, which ends up causing impotence and difficulty getting or maintaining an erection.\n\nThese are all the problems that happen when you start screwing around with ONE hormone. It causes a negative ripple effect.\n\nThe Secret To Fixing It\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying to get off Propecia, especially if you are seeing positive hair growth. This is up to you.\n\nHowever, you DO need to rebalance and optimize your hormones, to similar ratios when you were a teenager and your early 20s \u2014 when you felt and performed the best, and had the most head hair.\n\nDecrease elevated estrogen levels.\n\nLower prolactin levels.\n\nIncrease testosterone \u2013 which does NOT cause hair loss, but DOES improve your sex drive, muscle mass, fat loss, and mood.\n\nRaise your dopamine levels \u2013 you\u2019ll be happier and hornier.\n\nIncrease Nitric Oxide and inhibit PDE-5 enzyme for better blood flow and erections.\n\nDo these 5 and you\u2019ll fix the negative side-effects of finasteride (Propecia/Proscar) because you\u2019ll be rebalancing and optimizing your hormones to their youthful levels.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have better hair and a healthier prostate as well.\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated many times, genetics aside \u2013 the way you look and feel is based on your hormones and neurotransmitters.\n\nOf course, you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cOkay, great\u2026 BUT HOW do I do all of this?!!\u201d\n\nI have a direct link to natural herbs and vitamins that will help accomplish these goals, naturally \u2013 without drugs. And a formula that I use myself.\n\nPlus, here\u2019s the link to the multi-part article series about hair loss that I mentioned at the beginning of this article.\n\nJust know that you have to fix these hormonal imbalances NOW because it\u2019s only going to get worse as you get older. And life is too valuable to have emotional and sexual problems, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\n\nNow you can have your hair, perform sexually, and feel great!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "I was asked in 2025 if eating garlic will help with improving erections and if it\u2019s a solution for impotency?\n\nSo I did some research to save you time and there are no clinical studies validating this.\n\nHowever, some people report taking 4 or more, raw cloves of garlic daily will help improve blood flow and THIS would be a potential reason for improving erectile dysfunction.\n\nAnd this would be because raw garlic contains an ingredient called allicin, which helps stimulate circulation throughout the body and hopefully, to the penis as well.\n\nBut, this just isn\u2019t the case.\n\nIs Garlic the Solution?\n\nGarlic is very healthy\u2026 but, let\u2019s get some things straight.\n\nFirst of all, you would need to consume a lot of garlic to get enough allicin to improve blood flow. Over a dozen cloves of garlic daily.\n\nSecondly, eating raw garlic is going to make you smell.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t care how much better your erections may become due to the garlic, you\u2019re not going to get laid smelling like garlic. This I will guarantee!\n\nCooking garlic kills off the allicin and most of its nutrients, so you can\u2019t do this either.\n\nAnd garlic supplements, which must contain the allicin extract, will ALSO make you smell. Not just your breath, all of you \u2013 skin, hair, etc.\n\nIf you want to improve blood flow and circulation, there are specific combinations of ingredients, that when used together, dramatically improve circulation \u2013 much better than garlic and without any smell.\n\nThe Secret to Better Erections\n\nHowever, when concerned about better erections and more specifically, direct blood flow to the penis, this has to do with 3 main things:\n\nIncreasing total and free testosterone levels.\n\nImproving Nitric Oxide levels, which dilates the blood vessels and improves blood flow.\n\nAnd taking a PDE-5 inhibitor, which directly increases blood flow straight to the penis. Drugs like Viagra and Cialis work like this. As does a couple of natural herbs and amino acids.\n\nEach one will work nicely, but the secret is to do all 3 at the same time \u2013 for maximum benefits and long-lasting results.\n\nAnd, I\u2019ve listed the best ingredients that accomplish these goals \u2013 a formula that I take myself for the past 20 years.\n\nAnd I promise you, you will NOT smell at all \u2013 unlike with garlic.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "As Marijuana becomes more legalized, I get asked questions often these days, such as:\n\nIf using pot or THC, lowers testosterone?\n\nIf you lose muscle size?\n\nIf it lowers your sex drive?\n\nIf it makes you fatter?\n\nIf it causes man-boobs (gynecomastia)?\n\nAnd similar questions.\n\nGenerally, these questions are from men.\n\nHowever, this also affects women as well. In fact, just a few weeks ago I had one of my private clients tell me that after filming ends on one of her movies, she reduces and stops smoking pot. And within days, her sex drive shoots up like crazy\u2026 and asked why?\n\nAnd the answer is that yes, marijuana lowers testosterone levels. I\u2019ve seen it over and over again in dozens of blood tests over the years and especially in recent times since it\u2019s now legal and people have easy access.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, it also creates an imbalance in other hormones, which I\u2019ll get to in a minute.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown this for years. In 1974, The New England Journal Of Medicine1 showed that marijuana smokers between the age of 18-28, had testosterone levels of about 416 ng, while the non-smokers had 742 ng. That\u2019s like half the testosterone.\n\nNormal levels are roughly between 300-900, on the higher end for guys in their 20s. YET, the pot smokers were near the low/normal range. That\u2019s horrible!\n\nIn another human study4, it showed that testosterone levels drop by 33% within an hour and 66% within 2 hours. Again, not good.\n\nHowever, there are other studies showing very little difference.\n\nMan Boobs \u2013 Gynecomastia\n\nMen can get gynecomastia (aka \u201cgyno\u201d), which is also called \u201cman boobs\u201d or \u201cmoobs\u201d.\n\nThis happens when estrogen levels go up\u2026 which then causes a negative feedback loop in your body, causing a decrease in testosterone levels.\n\nThus, the imbalance will cause swelling in your nipples, leading to man boobs.\n\nThis will also eventually accelerate prostate problems (BPH) and hair loss as well. But, that\u2019s another topic for another day.\n\nAnd, there are studies2,3 showing that marijuana use causes higher estrogen levels and thus, leading to all of these problems.\n\nAnother problem with all of this is that for sure, marijuana lowers sperm concentrations, count and mobility.5-7\n\nThe crazy part is that the negative effects happen with just once-a-week usage and can last for 3 months or longer.6,7\n\nSo if you want to have kids, you better stop using cannabis.\n\nSo, let me give you REAL life feedback that I have since my background is in both Pharmacology (the study of drugs) and Endocrinology (the study of hormones).\n\nYES \u2013 marijuana lowers your testosterone levels by decreasing FSH and LH levels.\n\nYES \u2013 it increases estrogen levels, which further decreases your testosterone levels.\n\nYES \u2013 it can cause and exacerbate gynecomastia / \u201cMan Boobs\u201d.\n\nYES \u2013 it will cause negativity in your sperm count, motility, and quality.\n\nHowever, some things to keep in mind.\n\nEveryone reacts differently.\n\nThe more you use and the higher the dosage, the worse the effects.\n\nThe younger you are, the worse the effects.\n\nThe good news is that all of this can be reversed, once you stop using any form of cannabis and the active ingredient, THC.\n\nLastly, for many people, marijuana relaxes them and makes them kinda lazy and thus, they don\u2019t want to go to the gym. And if they do, because pot is a depressant on your Nervous System (CNS), your strength goes down.\n\nAll of this means less muscle, which gets even worse with the lowered testosterone.\n\nBut, YOU have to be the judge of it \u2014 see how it affects your life and mood.\n\nOne other thing, IF you don\u2019t want to stop using marijuana, or you\u2019re concerned about your testosterone levels or sex drive \u2026 and you want to improve your levels and ALSO decrease negative hormones such as estrogen and stress hormones like cortisol, then I suggest you discover a natural method for increasing your testosterone \u2014 without any change in your lifestyle.\n\nThis is especially important for anyone over the age of 30.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM197404182901602\n\nhttps://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/marijuana-induced-gynecomastia-clinical-and-laboratory-experience-4\n\nhttp://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM197211022871824\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6316036\n\nhttps://inhalemd.com/blog/does-marijuana-affect-sperm-count-male-fertility/\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/aje/article/182/6/473/82600\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/29/8/1629/2913908",

    "content": "So today I\u2019m going to discuss one of the most popular supplements for athletes \u2013 for building muscle, strength, and stamina \u2013 and that\u2019s creatine.\n\nMake sure you read until the end of this article because I\u2019m also going to discuss the #1 cause for building muscle and losing fat, which I assume is the reason most people take creatine.\n\nNow, getting back to creatine. It\u2019s a very old supplement, and until 2025 it\u2019s been highly researched, and because of this, it\u2019s also misunderstood and so much of the information about it is wrong.\n\nAnd this comes from the fact that I first tried it well over 25 years ago and it was super expensive back then. I remember it was something like 100 grams or about 3 oz was $50.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve tried multiple versions and variations trying to see what works the best, IF at all.\n\nI bring this because someone asked me:\n\n\u201cHey Dr. Sam \u2013 I\u2019m so confused about creatine. First, does it work or not? Is it safe? I heard it\u2019s bad for the kidneys. Also, which form is the best? There are so many \u2013 creatine monohydrate, ethyl ester, hydrochloride, buffered, liquid, magnesium, and on and on. You\u2019ve never steered me wrong. please give me the 411.\u201d\n\nYes, there are so many different forms of creatine because the supplement companies know that it\u2019s so popular that they keep wanting to sell you something \u201ccool\u201d or \u201cnew and better\u201d. It\u2019s mainly about making money.\n\nI hate it because just like you, I am tired of being ripped off and lied to.\n\nWhich Creatine Works Best?\n\nAnyway, the bottom line is the best form and most researched is the original Creatine Monohydrate. It works the best, it\u2019s the safest, and guess what \u2013 also the least expensive.\n\nNow you can get that same amount of 100 grams for about $4 vs the $50 I used to spend. And I\u2019ll give you the link to this at the end of today\u2019s article.\n\nOne problem with creatine is that it doesn\u2019t dissolve very well and thus, doesn\u2019t get absorbed fully.\n\nSo my suggestion is to get micronized creatine monohydrate.\n\nPut it in 8-16 oz of warm water and I suggest using about 2.5 grams at a time. Less, but more often.\n\nHow Much Creatine Should I Take?\n\nAs far as the total daily use: forget the \u201cloading\u201d phase of using 20 grams for a week or two. These higher doses are linked to kidney problems and even kidney damage.1-2\n\nIt\u2019s just safer to take about 5 to a maximum of 7.5 grams daily.\n\nSo, my suggestion is to take 2.5 grams, which is half the recommended dose. Do it with 8-16 oz of warm water preferably. And do this 2-3x daily.\n\nHow Often Should I Take It?\n\nThe best times would be about 1-2 hours before your workout and also immediately after your workout.\n\nOtherwise, just spread it throughout the day, 2-3x daily.\n\nYou might take 7.5 grams total on workout days. 5 grams on NON-workout days. And, I also suggest you take OFF one day a week \u2013 this can be your non-workout day.\n\nIt\u2019s always good to take a break from all supplements, even if it\u2019s just once weekly.\n\nWill It Surely Work For Me?\n\nKeep in mind that creatine doesn\u2019t work for everyone. For some people, it works better, like anything else. I\u2019ve noticed that for those who don\u2019t eat red meat, it works better for them. Vegetarians see the most effects.\n\nSo there you have it for the creatine \u2013 save your money and get the most benefits with micronized creatine monohydrate.\n\nHowever, if your goal is to gain muscle and strength while losing belly fat \u2013 you MUST optimize your hormones.\n\nThis means increasing your anabolic, muscle-building hormones such as testosterone while minimizing your \u201cnegative\u201d hormones such as female and stress hormones.\n\nAll the creatine in the world won\u2019t do anything if your hormones suck and you have low testosterone. This is a simple fact of life.\n\nYou can read about a formula that you can use, that\u2019s guaranteed to optimize your hormones and thus, maximize your muscle-building, and fat-burning potential \u2013 at any age.\n\nClick the link, try the formula, and speed up your progress at the gym.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3661339/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421632/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3661339/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421632/",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/how-to-stop-masturbating-should-you/",
    "content": "For whatever reason, in 2025, I get asked a lot of questions about masturbating. And since this blog is about YOU, I do my best to address and discuss the topics you\u2019re most interested in.\n\nBecause of this, I\u2019ve done a couple of articles about masturbating, including one entitled: \u201cWARNING: The Negative Effects Of Masturbation\u201d.\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t already seen that article, you can do so after you read this one.\n\nI bring this up because I\u2019ve had over a dozen guys asking about that article \u2013 \u201chow do I stop masturbating?\u201d.\n\nKeep in mind that masturbation is normal and it\u2019s not bad for you. However, in the original article, I discussed when and how \u201ctoo much\u201d masturbation can be unhealthy \u2013 for both your body and your personal life.\n\nAgain, you can get the details when you read that original article.\n\nBut today, I want to discuss 3 effective ways that you can stop or more importantly, reduce masturbation.\n\nNo matter what happens or what I share with you to do today, you FIRST need to become more aware of when you\u2019re focused or obsessed about masturbating.\n\nYou need to become more cognizant and aware of your thoughts, triggers, and actions, as it pertains to masturbating.\n\nOtherwise, you\u2019ll go back to your old habits.\n\nSo, one of the biggest reasons, causes, and/or catalysts for masturbating is watching porn.\n\nYou may be horny and want to masturbate and so forth. However, just going to a porn site or you start watching porn, immediately \u201cputs the wheels in motion\u201d and there\u2019s no stopping it.\n\nSo my suggestion is you stop watching porn. And if you can\u2019t control yourself and know you\u2019re going to go to some porn sites, just get an app on your browser or phone to BLOCK you from allowing you to go to porn sites.\n\nHere are a few sites with more information about these apps or browser extensions.\n\nThe bottom line here is you need to remove things that bring you temptation to masturbate.\n\nOne big reason people masturbate or masturbate too much is they\u2019re bored. They have too much time on their hands.\n\nSo, you need to get busy. Go to the gym, exercise, spend time with friends, go for walks, start a new business, go read, and feed your brain.\n\nThe bottom line is you need to find a substitute for the time and energy spent on masturbating and put it towards something else that\u2019s productive and betters and improves your life.\n\nFor some people, stopping something \u201ccold turkey\u201d works. I don\u2019t recommend this when it comes to stopping a drug addiction since you can have very negative physical reactions.\n\nHowever, stopping cold turkey with masturbating is an option because there won\u2019t be any negative, physical consequences.\n\nHowever, maybe the goal isn\u2019t to stop but to reduce masturbation.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re doing it every single day, maybe your goal is to reduce it to once or twice weekly. If that\u2019s the case, every week reduces it by one day and in about a month, you\u2019ve gone from 7 times weekly to twice weekly.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing it multiple times daily, every day, then you need to slowly reduce that to once daily, 7x weekly, and then eventually down to 1-2x weekly.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m just using these examples since I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in your personal life.\n\nThe bottom line is you can either stop or dramatically reduce masturbation.\n\nMake a plan and execute it.\n\nBe patient and don\u2019t punish or shame yourself. Just keep making improvements, so you don\u2019t go back to your old habits.\n\nReduce temptation and stop watching porn and going to porn websites. And if you can\u2019t control yourself, get apps that block porn sites.\n\nBoredom is a big cause of masturbating. So get busy, go outside, spend time with friends, go exercise, and get that energy out and keep yourself busy.\n\nMake a plan, execute it, and be patient. Don\u2019t punish or shame yourself. Just keep making improvements.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "\u2757 Shocking Truth: Why BCAA Are A Rip-Off (2025)",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/shocking-truth-why-bcaa-are-a-rip-off/",
    "content": "I get asked a lot of questions about BCAA. Such as this one I received just yesterday:\n\n\u201cDoc, I want to take some BCAA to my pre and post workout, so I can gain more muscle and also lose fat. how many grams should I take? Also, does the stuff even work? I trust you, so please be honest because it can get expensive. I wanted to take 5 grams. what do you think?\u201d\n\nSo, I\u2019ll keep today\u2019s topic short because BCAA isn\u2019t new and there isn\u2019t anything really special about them.\n\nHow Do BCAAs Work in Building Muscle and Losing Fat?\n\nFirst, BCAAs consist of 3 amino acids \u2013 leucine, isoleucine, and valine. And of the 3, leucine is the most important one for building muscle and losing fat. BCAAs can be both anabolic and anti-catabolic at the same time. When used at the correct dose, they can raise GH (anabolic) and insulin (anti-catabolic).\n\nAdditionally, taking BCAA prior to a workout and during as well, can help increase testosterone levels post-workout.1\n\nThus, the main benefits are from positive hormonal changes.\n\nHow Much BCAA Do I Need?\n\nHowever, many of these studies, facts, and figures are based on HIGH doses of BCAAs. About 0.2 grams per lb of bodyweight. Thus, if you weigh 200 lbs, you need about 40 GRAMS of BCAAs to get the full benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s VERY expensive and a total rip-off in my opinion.\n\nSo if you aren\u2019t going to take that big of a dose, don\u2019t bother.\n\nAnd yes, I\u2019ve tried this high of a dose and it\u2019s disgusting and it made me light headed. But I did feel some benefits and more energy.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve also used 5-10 grams of BCAA and haven\u2019t noticed much of anything.\n\nCertainly, nothing to justify the high costs.\n\nAnd I did all of this for at least a month to see what I would actually see and feel.\n\nAs I said, BCAA is nothing new and in the early \u201990s, the magazines advertised how amazing they were. Just as they still are doing now.\n\nIn fact, I remember when HMB came to the market, which is a metabolite of leucine \u2013 the most powerful amino of the BCAAs.\n\nHMB is clinically proven to help build muscle and so forth.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve tried high doses of this when I worked with EAS in the \u201990s.\n\nStill, nothing amazing happened, certainly NOT at the regular doses.\n\nThe Best and Most Cost-Effective Way\n\nIf you want to take BCAA, I suggest you simply take 25-50 grams of a good whey protein isolate.\n\n25 grams of whey protein has about 5 grams of BCAAs. PLUS, you get all the other amino acids as well (essential and non-essential). And it\u2019s at a fraction of the price of BCAA\u2019s.\n\nSo instead of taking 10 grams of BCAA, take 50 grams of a good quality whey protein isolate. Mix it up, maybe even add in 5 grams of glutamine in it. Then slowly sip some of it before, during, and after your workout.\n\nIt has \u201cwhey\u201d more benefits at a fraction of the price of BCAA\u2019s.\n\nLike I said before, building muscle and losing fat is all about genetics and hormones. You can\u2019t really change your genetics, but you CAN optimize your hormones.\n\nAnd the most powerful muscle-building hormone is testosterone. This is why men are bigger and stronger than women. It\u2019s not growth hormone, peptides, or anything else. It will always come down to steroids and the best, safest, and more natural is testosterone.\n\nWith that said, learn how you can naturally boost your testosterone levels and at the same time, decrease negative, \u201ccatabolic\u201d, muscle-killing hormones.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/increasing-testosterone-with-d-aspartic-acid-research-reveals-truth/",
    "content": "If you\u2019re a subscriber to my blog, you know I get a lot of questions about improving hormones \u2013 especially testosterone. This is because testosterone is the KING of all hormones for men.\n\nIncrease muscle mass and strength\n\nDecrease fat, especially belly\n\nImprove libido and erection strength\n\nEnhance mood and happiness\n\nImprove cognition and memory\n\nAnd since there\u2019s a decline in testosterone for men around the age of 25-27, especially in modern days, guys are looking for anything to help increase their testosterone, naturally.\n\nI also wanted these benefits and that\u2019s why over 20 years ago, I formulated one of the most potent and clinically tested testosterone boosters and hormone-optimizing products on the market \u2013 called AlphaViril\u2026 which has a 20-year proven track record.\n\nHowever, in 2025, I\u2019ve been asked many times about D-Aspartic Acid \u2014 does it work for boosting testosterone levels and why didn\u2019t I include it in AlphaViril?\n\nToday I\u2019ll quickly discuss:\n\nThe results in men who exercise and those that don\u2019t, including my own personal experience.\n\nHow to make it work better and improve results.\n\nWhat Is D-Aspartic Acid\n\nFirst, a quick background.\n\nAlmost every amino acid can occur in two different forms. For example, aspartic acid can be found as L-Aspartic acid or D-Aspartic acid. The forms have the same chemical formula, but their molecular structures are mirror images of each other.\n\nL-Aspartic acid is produced in nature, including in your body, and used to build proteins. However, D-Aspartic acid isn\u2019t used to build proteins. Instead, it plays a role in making and releasing hormones in the body.1-2\n\nThis includes the increase in testosterone production and release in the testicles.3\n\nAnd thus, why many companies sell D-Aspartic acid as a testosterone booster. So far, so good.\n\nMy Personal Experience With It\n\nWhen I found out about D-Aspartic acid years ago and it started getting popular, I decided to give it a try. Even though I\u2019m a doctor, I\u2019m still like everyone else. A new supplement comes out, I go give it a try and I experiment a lot with it.\n\nAnd when it first came out, it was fairly expensive.\n\nI tried 1 gram for a week and then 3 grams for a week and eventually 6 grams for a week. These were daily doses.\n\nI think at the higher dose, I started to feel an increase in my sex drive, but it wasn\u2019t by much. To me, a higher sex drive and better erections is a quick test to see if the product is working at boosting my testosterone levels.\n\nBut after about a week or two, I felt nothing and my libido went down. Basically, around the 2-week mark, I felt the opposite happening.\n\nI then took a break and gave it a try again a few months later and again, similar results.\n\nHowever, in all honesty \u2013 I never did a hormone test to see if it worked at increasing my testosterone levels or not. I just did it by feel.\n\nClinical Studies & Results\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at the clinical studies with D-Aspartic acid. Unfortunately, it\u2019s all over the place with mixed results.\n\nFor example, in one 12 DAY study, 20 out of 23 men saw an average increase in testosterone by 24%.4 But the study didn\u2019t give the dose used and it was with men who don\u2019t exercise. It didn\u2019t give age either. So for me, this is a poor study.\n\nIn another study that lasted 90 days, with men aged 37-43, who had sub-fertility and low sperm production, the D-Aspartic group experienced over a 30% increase in testosterone.5 This is good, but keep in mind this is NOT with guys who exercise and have normal fertility.\n\nIn fact, one study found NO increase in testosterone in men who performed weight training and took D-Aspartic acid for 28 days.6\n\nWhat\u2019s more, another study found that two weeks of taking a high-dose supplement of 6 grams per day actually decreased testosterone in young men who weight trained.7\n\nSummary On Testosterone: Based on the studies, D-Aspartic acid may increase testosterone levels in inactive men. However, it has NOT been shown to boost testosterone in men who weight train.\n\nWeight Training Results\n\nOne assumes that an increase in testosterone will also build more muscle and increase strength.\n\nHowever, studies have shown that men performing weight training experienced no increases in testosterone, strength, or muscle mass when they took D-Aspartic acid supplements.8-10\n\nOne study found that when men took D-Aspartic acid and weight trained for 28 days, they experienced a 2.9-pound (1.3-kg) increase in lean mass. However, those in the placebo group experienced a similar increase of 3 pounds (1.4 kg) 8\n\nWhat\u2019s more, both groups experienced similar increases in muscle strength. Thus, the D-Aspartic acid didn\u2019t work any better than the placebo in this study.\n\nA longer, three-month study also found that men who exercised experienced the same increase in muscle mass and strength, regardless of whether they took D-Aspartic acid or a placebo.\n\nSummary On Weight Training: Bottom line is that D-Aspartic Acid does NOT appear to improve muscle size or strength gains.\n\nD-Aspartic Acid Dosage And Results\n\nMost studies and recommended dosages for D-Aspartic acid is 3 grams daily. That\u2019s 3000 mgs.\n\nUnfortunately, this appears to work in some men and not on others. Mainly, it works in people who do not exercise.\n\nHowever, it does seem to help with sperm mobility and production. This is good for guys who are trying to have a baby and increase their fertility.5 This part it seems to have the most positive results and the dose is 3 grams for 90 days.\n\nAlso, if you do want to try D-Aspartic acid, use the POWDER form, not the pills. It\u2019s much less expensive and here\u2019s a product on Amazon for one that\u2019s a good price \u2013 since they are all the same form.\n\nThe Problem With Testosterone Boosters\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated in the past, you can\u2019t simply increase your testosterone levels and expect it to stay that way. This is because your body has \u201cchecks and balances\u201d.\n\nFor example, increasing testosterone levels is a good start \u2013 but you also, and more importantly, want to increase your FREE testosterone levels at the same time. This is done by lowering SHBG.\n\nBut with these supplements, your body quickly adapts and the testosterone boost is temporary and soon, it drops again.\n\nAdditionally, the older you are, the most the testosterone converts to \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones \u2013 such as estrogen, prolactin, DHT, and adrenal and stress hormones.\n\nAgain, the end result is the temporary boost in testosterone, stops in about 2 weeks, your body adjusts and adapts and now, you have low testosterone again, but this time it\u2019s even worse \u2013 HIGHER negative hormones.\n\nBecause my background is in endocrinology and hormones, I understand and know about all of this. This is why AlphaViril works so well \u2013 I\u2019ve addressed all of these issues.\n\nThus, your testosterone goes higher and stays higher, while negative hormones go back down and thus, you have the levels of a youthful, young man at his prime. THAT\u2019S the goal!\n\nAnyway, if you want to give D-Aspartic acid a try, go ahead. My suggestion is to take 3 grams, about an hour before your workouts. Only about 3-4X weekly. This is enough to prevent adaptation and then see how you feel and look over the next few weeks and months.\n\nOf course, I highly suggest you give AlphaViril a try if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s so effective it comes with a one year guarantee.\n\nIn fact, if it doesn\u2019t help improve your hormones at the end of 30 days, you\u2019ll get a full refund plus an additional $100.00 cashback on top of it.\n\nI can make such a crazy guarantee because I have over 20+ years of proven clinical data and real feedback from thousands of users.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not trying to sell you a product \u2013 I\u2019m just offering you a proven solution that has worked for thousands of men around the world, including myself \u2013 I\u2019m the original reason I formulated AlphaViril \u2013 it was for me and I\u2019ve continued to take it on and off for 2 decades.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18642934\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10744627\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17118457\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19860889\n\nhttp://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?paperID=24016\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24074738\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25844073\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24074738\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25844073\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28841667",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/cialis-vs-viagra-dont-use-either-until-you-see-this/",
    "content": "One thing I\u2019ve realized since making my blog is that there are LOTS of guys dealing with erectile problems. So if you\u2019re reading this, know that you are NOT alone.\n\nDaily I get questions about this topic and often, I feel bad because there are natural solutions that can really fix erectile issues, permanently and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve done so many articles about this topic.\n\nNot only is a good erection a key indicator of good physical health, but also good emotional health. Because having erectile problems NEGATIVELY affects your confidence and your relationships.\n\nAnd because of this, one of the most popular videos I\u2019ve made was revealing the #1 Natural Alternative To Cialis and #1 Natural Alternative To Viagra \u2014 these two drugs being the best-selling and most popular Erectile Dysfunction (ED) medications.\n\nOnce this article was released, I got hundreds and thousands of questions and comments, from some of the most popular beings:\n\nWhat\u2019s the main difference between these two drugs?\n\nWhich one works better?\n\nWhat are the side effects?\n\nHow can I reduce or eliminate the negatives?\n\nWhy do they not work in over 40% of people, especially older guys that need it the most?\n\nHow can I make them work better?\n\nDo natural alternatives even exist and if \u201cyes\u201d, do they work?\n\nThere were a lot more, but these kept repeating over and over again.\n\nSo, I thought it\u2019s best that I make a quick article about these top questions, so you don\u2019t waste your time or money. Most importantly, you\u2019re safe and also get maximum results.\n\nAs a reminder, both Cialis and Viagra are phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. When sexually stimulated, both of these drugs increase the flow of blood to the penis, which in turn causes an erection in the penis\u2026 for most men.\n\nPlease note that both of these drugs do not increase sexual desire \u2013 physically or emotionally. Only testosterone does this and I\u2019ll tell you more about this in a couple of minutes.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Difference Between Cialis & Viagra?\n\nThere are two differences and one MAIN one \u2013 which is the half-life of these drugs. Thus, how quickly they work and then stop working.\n\nViagra works quickly, in about 30-60 minutes. The half-life is about 4 hours and thus, it basically stops working in about 6-8 hours. The main peak is in about 1-2 hours.\n\nCialis is longer acting. It takes about 1-2 hours to kick in and has a half-life of about 16 hours. So, it peaks in about 8 hours and the effects stop in about 36 hours.\n\nOne other difference is that Viagra has to be taken on an empty stomach, while Cialis can be taken with food \u2013 even though, it does work better on an empty stomach \u2014 in fact, most drugs do.\n\nWhich One Works Better?\n\nIt all depends on your goal. If you\u2019re fairly certain you\u2019re about to have sex, then Viagra is your choice. It\u2019ll kick in quickly, you\u2019ll do your job and it\u2019ll be out of your system in a few hours.\n\nBut if you\u2019re not sure and you don\u2019t want to time it, or you\u2019re going away for the weekend or something similar, then Cialis would be ideal. Just take it a few hours before you may have sex and if it happens, then it\u2019s already in your system.\n\nNOTE: Keep in mind something very important, these drugs do NOT work in about 40% of people and actually stop working after a while. This is because they do NOTHING to fix the original cause of the problem \u2013 which is low testosterone and hormonal imbalances.\n\nIronically, the older you get, the less these drugs work because your hormones keep getting worse. So, you MUST fix your hormones first and you won\u2019t even need these drugs or they will work much better at a lower dose.\n\nWhich Is Safer \u2013 Cialis or Viagra?\n\nWell, they both have the same side effects because they both do the same thing, inhibit the PDE-5 enzyme.\n\nThe most common problems are:\n\nsinus pain and pressure\n\nThey also cause stress on your kidney and liver. If you\u2019ve had a heart attack or stroke or a family history of either, you shouldn\u2019t take them.\n\nAlso, if you have high or low blood pressure, don\u2019t take these drugs.\n\nIn fact, I have a friend and his wife who were trying to get pregnant and after trying so many times, he needed some help. He took just half a Viagra and his wife found him passed out on the bathroom floor because his blood pressure dropped too low.\n\nAnd this happens often.\n\nAdditionally, the more you use these drugs, the less they work, and hence, it\u2019s even harder to get an erection naturally, without these drugs.\n\nTo me, this is a major negative.\n\nIs There Any Way To Reduce The Negative Side-Effects?\n\nYes, you use them less often and at a lower dose. But then, they\u2019ll work even less.\n\nThis is the problem with drugs and the fact they\u2019re designed to reduce the symptoms, but NEVER to fix the real, underlying cause.\n\nThis again, is to improve your hormones by increasing your \u201cpro-sexual\u201d hormones, such as total testosterone and free testosterone, and neurotransmitters such as Dopamine. While also reducing negative hormones such as female and stress hormones.\n\nHow Can I Make Viagra & Cialis Work Better?\n\nFirst, taking either on an empty stomach is best, especially Viagra.\n\nHowever, by improving your hormones, these drugs work better, and thus, even a lower dose is needed, which also means fewer negatives.\n\nIn fact, this is why these drugs work so much better in younger guys in their 20s. While working less the older you get.\n\nWhy Do They Not Work In Over 40% Of Users?\n\nWell, not all drugs work for every person. But the main reason is again, you need the raw materials for sex drive and libido \u2013 both emotional, mental, and physical drive \u2013 and that\u2019s having optimal hormones and higher total and free testosterone levels.\n\nYoung guys have this and that\u2019s why these drugs work better. But starting in your 30s, your hormones have really dropped.\n\nBy 40s and 50s, you\u2019re barely producing 50% of the hormones you need to have a good sex drive.\n\nA guy in his 60s who really needs these drugs usually gets only the negative effects and barely any positives \u2013 even at the max dose.\n\nWhy?\u2026 because he has low testosterone!\n\nFix the hormones and you fix your erections.\n\nAre There Natural Alternatives To Viagra and Cialis?\n\nNot until recently. There\u2019s a rare herb that most people don\u2019t know about and it\u2019s very hard to get and expensive to produce. It\u2019s called Xanthoparmelia Scabrosa containing 35% Piperazine extract. It\u2019s an herbal, PDE-5 inhibitor.\n\nIt\u2019s not as strong as Viagra or Cialis, but it does work at the correct dose.\n\nYou also want to take ingredients that increase your Nitric Oxide levels, which increases blood to your penis.\n\nHowever, you again need to make sure your hormones are balanced and optimal, or else none of these will work correctly or long-term.\n\nViagra and Cialis are both PDE-5 inhibitors and work the same.\n\nViagra has a much shorter half-life.\n\nThey have similar side effects.\n\nThe more you use them, the less they work.\n\nIn order to make them work better and increase your sex drive permanently, you need to increase your testosterone levels and optimize your hormonal balance.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/warning-how-vaping-affects-your-testosterone-and-erections/",
    "content": "A little while back I did an article about vaping since it\u2019s become so popular these days. I got a lot of hits and of course, some good questions.\n\nHowever, a few guys asked if vaping affects testosterone levels? And so, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be discussing today.\n\nVaping & Marijuana/Pot\n\nPeople \u201cvape\u201d marijuana or nicotine.\n\nIn regards to those users vaping marijuana \u2013 YES, it negatively affects your testosterone levels. It lowers it and at the same time, increases your female hormone, estrogen.\n\nIn fact, as estrogen levels go up, your testosterone levels drop.\n\nIn this scenario, vaping isn\u2019t the cause of the decreased testosterone \u2013 it\u2019s the marijuana.\n\nNeedless to say, whether you smoke or vape marijuana, it will lower testosterone and increase estrogen.\n\nWhen vaping first started over a decade ago, it was in the form of e-cigarettes. Thus, people were vaping nicotine. So, this is similar to smoking a cigarette, but with a lot fewer toxic chemicals.\n\nTechnically speaking, vaping nicotine is safer than smoking a cigarette. However, it is still NOT safe.\n\nNow, what\u2019s interesting is that one reason cigarette smokers lose weight is the fact that nicotine acts as a mild aromatase inhibitor and thus, an estrogen reducer.\n\nAs estrogen levels decrease, it\u2019s easier to lose fat.\n\nThe second benefit of lowering estrogen is the simultaneous rise in testosterone levels. This is the opposite of marijuana.\n\nSo initially, using nicotine, whether smoking or vaping, actually causes a small increase in testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, this is mild and temporary. It\u2019ll only last an hour or two and thus, you need to continually be ingesting nicotine to get the small testosterone-boosting benefits.\n\nBUT, none of this matters because, after about 2-3 weeks of using nicotine, your body adapts and goes back to normal. Estrogen levels go up again and testosterone comes back down again to their original, previous levels.\n\nNow, what\u2019s interesting is that something else happens to your hormones when smoking or vaping \u2013 your stress hormones, such as cortisol goes up.\n\nWhen cortisol goes up, testosterone goes way down.\n\nSo, there\u2019s an initial and small increase in testosterone, then your body adapts and your levels go down to normal again and then due to an increase in stress hormones, your testosterone drops and stays down.\n\nBlood Flow & Impotence\n\nThe other problem with smoking or vaping nicotine is that it\u2019s a vasoconstrictor, which causes blood vessels to narrow and get smaller and thus, reducing blood flow.\n\nThis reduction in blood flow has negative effects on your entire body \u2014 muscles, brain, skin, hair, and so forth. But it ALSO affects your penis and the end result is erectile dysfunction and impotence.\n\nDon\u2019t vape marijuana or nicotine. The end results are negative changes in your hormones, with lowered testosterone levels and erectile dysfunction.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re reading this article, then I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re like most guys \u2013 you want to improve your hormones, increase your testosterone levels, and have amazing erections all the time.\n\nThis is especially important if you\u2019re over the age of 30.\n\nSo, do yourself a big favor and limit and stop vaping, marijuana, and/or nicotine.\n\nInstead, click this special link and discover a 20-year proven formula for increasing your testosterone levels at any age, naturally. This will obviously also help fix erectile problems, build more muscle, lose belly fat, and improve your mood and your outlook in life.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness/is-premature-ejaculation-linked-to-low-testosterone/",
    "content": "Someone commented on a recent article I made\u2026 and they asked:\n\n\u201cIs premature ejaculation linked to or caused by having low testosterone?\u201d\n\nAnd I bring this up because I\u2019ve had this question asked many times.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s an important topic because it\u2019s been estimated that 20-30% of men worldwide are commonly affected by premature ejaculation.1 In fact, it\u2019s considered one of the most common sexual dysfunctions in men.\n\nAnd I can honestly say that it\u2019s happened to almost every guy at some point in their life, so it\u2019s also very normal.\n\nIt does typically affect more younger men. However, it easily affects guys of any age, even older men in their 60s and beyond.\n\nWhile other sexual problems are lower in younger men and get worse as we age, such as 50% of men age 50 and 60% of men age 60 and so forth2, and erectile dysfunction has much more to do with low testosterone and hormonal imbalances and poor blood flow\u2026 Premature ejaculation does NOT.\n\nSo, to answer your question: No, premature ejaculation is typically not directly related to low testosterone. However, it can be caused by hormonal imbalances and/or abnormal levels of brain chemicals and neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin.\n\nDefinition Of Premature Ejaculation\n\nHowever, let\u2019s first define what Premature Ejaculation is:\n\nPremature ejaculation is defined as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, upon, or shortly after penetration, or before the person wishes, causing distress and embarrassment to one or both partners, potentially affecting sexual relationships and overall well-being.\n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the fact that guys don\u2019t want to talk about this \u2013 with friends, their partner, or even their doctor. So there\u2019s more shame involved.\n\nThis causes more anxiety, worry, and overthinking, and thus, making things worse.\n\nMen classified with probable premature ejaculation self-reported3\n\npoor control over ejaculation (50%)\n\nlow satisfaction with sexual intercourse (23%)\n\nlow satisfaction with sexual relationships (30%)\n\nlow interest in actually having sexual intercourse (28%)\n\ndifficulty in becoming sexually aroused (due to worry) (34%)\n\nand difficulty relaxing during intercourse (31%)\n\nThese findings highlight the negative impact of premature ejaculation on quality of life, sexual performance, and enjoyment of sex.\n\nAnd the more you think about it, the worse it can get.\n\nThe truth is, nobody knows the exact cause. I personally think it\u2019s both psychological and physical. Thus, both mental and hormonal.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a young guy who is going to have sex for the first time or you\u2019re new to sex, of course, you\u2019re going to orgasm quickly. It\u2019s all new and interesting, it feels great and your hormones are super high and you\u2019re really horny.\n\nOr if you rarely have sex or masturbate, there\u2019s a build-up and it needs to get out \u2013 if you know what I mean. So the minute you finally have sex, you\u2019re going to burst.\n\nVery different than if you just had sex earlier in the day, the need is not as high and you\u2019ll last longer.\n\nWorry, anxiety, depression, feeling guilty, and masturbation habits all can cause premature ejaculation.\n\nEven for example if you have erectile dysfunction and you\u2019re so worried that you\u2019re going to go limp and soft, you may then rush to have an orgasm and now it happened \u201cprematurely\u201d and sooner than you or your partner wanted.\n\nIn this case, it\u2019s both hormonal and emotional.\n\nAnd some guys have super sensitive penises\u2026 similar to some women who have a really sensitive clitoris and thus, stimulation is greatly heightened and you\u2019ll reach orgasm much faster.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Solution\n\nNow, in regards to solutions for ending or reducing premature ejaculation, I did an article about this specific topic called \u201c5 Proven Ways To END Premature Ejaculation\u201d.\n\nGo read it now, implement some of the tactics, and get control and confidence about this part of your life.\n\nYou can easily do it, so don\u2019t worry\u2026\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.news-medical.net/news/2004/05/12/1455.aspx https://www.uwhealth.org/urology/erectile-dysfunction-ed/20537 AUA by Andrew R.

    "content": "I\u2019s 2025 and a few months ago I did an article about the negative and positive effects of masturbation. Since then, I\u2019ve gotten a few hundred questions about this topic, mainly from men\u2026 since I guess maybe they masturbate a lot more than women.\n\nI was surprised about how much confusion there was about this topic and how many questions the guys had.\n\nOne of the most often asked questions was how masturbation affects testosterone levels \u2013 does it go up, go down, any negative effects?\n\nSince everyone always seems to be in a rush, the short answer to this question is, NO \u2013 masturbation and ejaculation haven\u2019t been shown to have any long-term or negative effects on testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, a longer and more accurate answer is that this isn\u2019t a very simple answer. Masturbation, whether solo or with a partner, can have a variety of effects \u2014 although mostly short term \u2014 on your testosterone levels.\n\nMasturbation \u2013 Increase or Decrease Testosterone Levels?\n\nOne study1 has shown that not masturbating for 3 weeks MAY cause a slight DECREASE in testosterone levels. However, this study was done on men who were older and had erectile dysfunction (ED) and thus, maybe not be an accurate representation of all men.\n\nYet, another study2 showed the exact opposite after the same 3 weeks, a slight INCREASE in testosterone levels.\n\nThere are lots of conflicting reports and studies.\n\nHowever, the bottom line is that whatever effects masturbation or ejaculation has, positive or negative, it\u2019s only short-term.\n\nYour body will always go right back to normal \u2013 whether that normally has \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d testosterone levels.\n\nMy advice is to enjoy your life because there are a lot of other things that will negatively affect your testosterone levels and WORRYING about masturbation is a lot worse for your health and testosterone levels \u2013 right?\u2026\n\nMasturbation & Building Muscle\n\nAnother question I received is \u201cWhat about building muscle\u201d and the answer is NO, masturbation doesn\u2019t affect your ability to build muscle \u2013 again because it has no long-term causing effects on your testosterone levels, which is the primary hormone that increases muscle mass and fat loss.\n\nHowever, if you are interested in increasing your testosterone levels naturally \u2014 whether it\u2019s because you want to\n\nImprove your sex drive\n\nFix any erectile problems you have\n\nOr simply, you want to feel more confident and youthful\n\nTake a look and discover a 20-year, proven formula for optimizing your hormones and maximizing your testosterone levels.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2605.1999.00196.x/full\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11760788",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health-se/the-1-question-about-the-negative-effects-of-masturbation/",
    "content": "Earlier this year (current_year]), due to popular demand and lots of questions about this topic, I made an article entitled, \u201cWARNING: The Negative Effects Of Masturbation\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s been viewed well over a million times, with hundreds of comments and questions.\n\nToday\u2019s topic is a follow-up to the #1 asked question about that article\u2026 which I\u2019ll get to in a second.\n\nSo one question that got asked many, many times is, \u201cHow often SHOULD I masturbate?\u201d\n\nWell, this is a difficult question to answer because everyone has different needs due to age, hormones, etc.\n\nSome people told me they were masturbating daily, sometimes multiple times a day. Obviously, this is a young guy because someone in their 30s and older aren\u2019t doing it this often.\n\nThey simply can\u2019t due to the lack of optimal hormonal balance. Plus, they\u2019re just too busy with life, more stress, more responsibilities, etc.\n\nAnyway, daily is too often as described in the original article.\n\nAnd I stated the negative reasons why, so please make sure you read that article.\n\nHowever, just like working out, there needs to be a balance between activity and rest.\n\nToo much, too often, and too long will always result in negative changes in your hormones and negative side effects.\n\nSo, my suggestion is to keep it simple and for those of you who are \u201cexcessive masturbators\u201d, reduce it to 3x weekly, or every other day.\n\nAnd I also define \u201cexcessive\u201d in the original article.\n\nOn your \u201coff days\u201d, when you\u2019re not masturbating, I suggest you do Kegel exercises.\n\nIt\u2019ll help improve erection strength, reduce erectile problems/dysfunctions, and improve your \u201cperformance\u201d in the bedroom.\n\nMaturbate, But Don\u2019t Orgasm\n\nThe other thing you can do on your \u201coff days\u201d, in addition to the Kegel exercises, is to masturbate, but NOT have an orgasm.\n\nMasturbation will help increase your testosterone levels, without the negative hormonal changes; such as an increase in Prolactin, which happens after your orgasm.\n\nHowever, you must NOT masturbate using any porn. Just close your eyes and use your mind. Be IN the moment.\n\nThis will help improve your \u201cmind-to-penis\u201d connection and it\u2019ll improve your performance in bed as well.\n\nThis is similar to when you\u2019re lifting weights \u2026 experienced lifters have learned to improve their \u201cmind-to-muscle\u201d connection, which results in better pumps, muscle growth, and performance.\n\nAnd for those of you who aren\u2019t \u201cexcessive masturbators\u201d, who want to know how often you \u201cshould\u201d masturbate, I think once a week is good enough.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t written in stone, and see how you feel and maybe you can go even less often.\n\nBut, once a week, IF you\u2019re not having sex and having orgasms, is enough to \u201ckeep the pipes clean\u201d, if you know what I mean?\n\nIt\u2019s also good for the prostate and has other benefits, as mentioned in the original article.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Thus, a heart attack or stroke.\n\nLastly, lower nitric oxide levels cause problems with gut health.\n\nBasically, rinsing with mouthwash daily could significantly affect the makeup of the bacteria in your mouth in a NEGATIVE way. This, in turn, causes problems with the gut lining, which increases a great risk of developing gastric ulcers.\n\nGranted, I personally don\u2019t believe using mouthwash daily is going to cause all of these major issues.\n\nBut, why risk it guys? Why do anything that can cause all of these problems?

Higher body fat = higher estrogen = lower testosterone.\n\nStable Blood Sugar \u2013 helps with free testosterone levels and decreases stress hormones.\n\nLower Blood Pressure \u2013 helps improve hormones from your adrenal glands and pituitary, while also lowering stress hormones.\n\nBetter Sleep \u2013 helps lower cortisol levels and stress hormones, while increasing testosterone and growth hormone levels.\n\nProper Exercise \u2013 the correct type and duration of exercise also make a difference.\n\nThe only problem with lifestyle changes is that most of us don\u2019t have the time or money or dedication or commitment or desire to make daily and long-term improvements.\n\nWe all want fast results, with the least amount of effort \u2014 especially when it comes to improving erections.\n\nSo with that said, I\u2019ve got two links for you.\n\nThe solution that\u2019s guaranteed to improve your hormones and erections.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/who-has-higher-testosterone-vegans-or-omnivores-clinical-study/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve done lots of articles about the importance of testosterone and more importantly, about having optimal balance and levels of your hormones.\n\nThis means, higher \u201cpositive\u201d hormones, such as:\n\nTotal and free testosterone levels\n\nWhile having lower, \u201cnegative\u201d hormones such as:\n\nFemale hormones like estrogen and prolactin\n\nStress hormones like cortisol\n\nDihydrotestosterone \u2013 which can cause hair loss and prostate problems\n\nIn fact, this is why I created AlphaViril over 20 years ago and why it\u2019s still one of the best-performing, hormone optimization solutions for guys in 2025.\n\nAre Vegans Better Than Omnivores?\n\nHowever, today\u2019s topic is about Vegans vs Omnivores \u2013 who have higher testosterone levels.\n\nMore importantly, who has better hormone levels and balance?\n\nEven more so, who performs the best?\n\nAnd I\u2019ve been asked by a bunch of guys regarding ONE study that had 3 groups of people1\n\nThis was in the British Journal of Cancer Study in 2000, over 20 years ago.\n\nThey concluded that \u201cVegans had 13% higher testosterone levels than meat-eaters and 8% higher than vegetarians.\u201d\n\nBased on this, Vegans clearly win and Omnivores lose!\n\nAnd when I was doing research about this, every pro-Vegan site was referencing this same, ONE study.\n\nAnd they continue to say how being a Vegan is awesome and everything about it is the best for your health, performance, how you look, live, and so on and so forth.\n\nOf course, then you go to the meat-eater websites and they say the opposite. The carnivore diet is the greatest and you\u2019ll be Superman and so forth.\n\nBasically, everyone has their own, silly bias.\n\nNOTHING scientific about it. All are emotional-based to validate their belief and values.\n\nThat is WRONG in my opinion. It\u2019s misleading. It\u2019s deceptive and deceitful.\n\nBut then again, none of these people are true scientists. They\u2019re just regular people expressing their opinions.\n\nWho Has Better Hormones?\n\nNow, if you go back to this ONE original study, the Vegans did have 13% higher testosterone.\n\nHowever, they also had higher SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin).\n\nThis means that the extra testosterone was bound and not \u201cfree\u201d to go do its job.\n\nYes, you want higher testosterone, but more importantly, you want higher FREE testosterone levels.\n\nThink of your testosterone as your TOTAL REVENUE and your free testosterone as your NET INCOME \u2013 after taxes and expenses.\n\nThe money that you can actually spend.\n\nHigher revenue and testosterone is great, but higher NET profit and FREE testosterone are better.\n\nThe bottom line is that all 3 groups had similar free testosterone, androstanediol, and LH levels.\n\nIt all balanced out at the end.\n\nHowever, the Vegan group did have lower IGF levels, which could mean they may live longer. However, it also means they\u2019ll have less muscle mass.\n\nThere was another study in 1990 that did a similar experiment.2 Male vegans vs omnivores.\n\nIt was a smaller study. It showed that Vegans had 7% higher testosterone levels, but also had 23% higher SHBG and had 3% LOWER free testosterone, and worst of all, had 11% higher estradiol levels.\n\nThus, the final hormonal balance in the vegans was worse than the omnivores.\n\nBut the bottom line is that all of this showed very little difference in the big picture.\n\nThe numbers all equaled out in the end.\n\nSo what\u2019s the best diet for improving testosterone levels?\u2026 it\u2019s whatever diet that you like and will enjoy and want to eat.\n\nIt\u2019s the one that makes you look and feel good, month after month, year after year, DECADE after DECADE.\n\nNever judge anything for just a few weeks or months.\n\nI\u2019ve known vegans who loved the diet and couldn\u2019t stop talking about it. Yet, 6 months or a year or even two years later, they stopped. Their performance dropped.\n\nBut some thrive on it.\n\nWe are all different, you just need to listen to YOUR body.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m going to give you 3 important suggestions.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to eat meat, make sure to eat healthy meat. Not processed junk. Get grass-fed and free-range and pasteurized and wild-caught and so forth.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to be a vegan, stay away or limit tofu and soy products. Make sure you take a good, B-complex supplement.\n\nMost importantly, both groups need to have at least 25% of their diet from healthy fats. Extra virgin olive oil, some coconut oil, avocados, omega fats (fish or plant-based), and raw nuts.\n\nAnd my most valuable and best suggestion is to take AlphaViril daily \u2013 regardless of your diet. Vegans, vegetarians, omnivores, carnivores, keto, and so forth.\n\nIt will optimize your testosterone levels and improve and balance your youth hormones.\n\nAND, it\u2019s Vegan, Non-GMO, and Clinically Validated!\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget, there are lots of other factors that affect your hormones. So make sure you read my blog regularly because I cover all of the testosterone-boosting tactics and will continue to do so.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2374537/pdf/83-6691152a.pdf\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2400756/",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/the-shocking-truth-about-morning-erections-your-health/",
    "content": "So today, I want to talk about morning erections and what it means to your health.\n\nUnfortunately, if you\u2019re not waking up with strong, morning erections as you used to in your younger years \u2013 this can be a clear sign of a few major health concerns and warnings, such as:\n\nNegative hormonal imbalances\n\nPoor blood flow & circulation\n\nHeart disease \u2013 which can lead to a heart attack or stroke\n\nDepression, again \u2013 due to hormonal imbalances\n\nAnd I bring up this topic today because I was recently asked:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 I\u2019m a little bit concerned, I rarely get morning erections. I searched online about this topic and as usual, it\u2019s mixed results and advice. So, I\u2019m now even more confused and frustrated. Basically, what\u2019s the cause, is it bad that I don\u2019t get them anymore as I used to when I was younger. I\u2019m also not as happy or driven in life and I don\u2019t know if all of this is a physical or mental issue or maybe both. Please help or do an article about this topic.\u201d\n\nAnd over the past few months, this type of question has been asked many times, so let me get right to the point of causes and solutions.\n\nWhat Causes Morning \u201cWood\u201d / Erections?\n\nWaking up with an erection or a \u201cwoody\u201d as some guys call it, is also called \u201cNocturnal Penile Tumescence\u201d (NPT).\n\nThis is a normal occurrence with most boys and men, especially when younger \u2013 when things are working properly and correctly.\n\nOne theory for the cause of morning erections is due to the timing of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep and because of the parasympathetic nervous system affecting the sacral nerve.\n\nThis nerve is connected to the bladder and simply stated \u2013 when you need to urinate, you\u2019ll get an erection.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t like this theory much because there are plenty of times I\u2019ve gotten up in the middle of the night to pee and I don\u2019t have an erection. So, why does it mainly happen in the morning?\n\nAnother theory is that you\u2019ve had a vivid and sexual dream and you\u2019re stimulated. Or, maybe your partner touches you while both of you are sleeping this is some sort of \u201csexual stimulation\u201d, which causes an erection.\n\nAgain, a bad theory in my opinion. Little boys get morning erections and I doubt they are having sexual dreams and there\u2019s nobody laying next to them that could sexually stimulate them.\n\nThe REAL Cause Of Morning Erections\n\nDo you know when a man does a hormone blood test for testosterone levels, they tell him to do it first thing in the morning?\u2026 This is because your testosterone, both total and free testosterone, is highest in the morning.\n\nAnd THIS is also the reason you have morning erections \u2013 healthy testosterone levels. More so, optimal hormonal balance.\n\nThis means lower estrogen levels and in fact, normal cortisol levels.\n\nIF estrogen and other female hormones are high, your testosterone will be lower and there\u2019s an imbalance between these male/female hormones.\n\nIF your stress hormones are also very high, such as cortisol and similar hormones, your testosterone will also be lower.\n\nIn fact, this is why when you\u2019re under heavy stress or you don\u2019t sleep well or not enough, you will not have morning erections. But, if you get a really good night\u2019s sleep, you\u2019ll wake up with a strong morning erection\u2026\n\nASSUMING your testosterone and other key hormones are ALSO balanced and in an optimal range.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you how you can quickly fix these hormones in a minute and do so, naturally. So please continue reading if this is something you want to fix.\n\nAnd of course, this all makes sense when you think about it \u2014 this is why when you\u2019re younger, you are usually waking up with strong, morning \u201cwood\u201d.\n\nNow, you may ask, \u201cBut wait, earlier you said little boys get morning erections \u2013 they don\u2019t have any testosterone yet?\u201d\n\nNo, this is incorrect.\n\nLittle boys may NOT be producing as much testosterone as adult males since their testicles aren\u2019t producing much, YET.\n\nHowever, they are STILL producing enough, especially from their adrenal glands.\n\nWhat IF You\u2019re NOT Getting Morning Erections?\n\nSo the next question is, what if you\u2019re not getting morning erections? What does this mean?\n\nOf course, as you get older, due to stresses in life, and so forth \u2013 I don\u2019t expect you to wake up with a crazy strong erection every morning, but you should most days.\n\nFOR SURE if you\u2019re in your 30s and younger.\n\nI\u2019m almost 50 and I get them every single morning, with the exception of days that I just haven\u2019t slept well for a couple of days and my stress levels are super high.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not having these frequent, morning erections at any age, then this is a warning sign:\n\nYour testosterone levels are dropping and are starting to get too low.\n\nYou have hormonal imbalances as well \u2014 higher female and stress hormones.\n\nYou have erectile dysfunction and if left untreated, it WILL get to impotence at some point.\n\nYou have poor blood flow \u2013 which can lead to high blood pressure, weaker arteries, and plaque and cholesterol buildup.\n\nYou\u2019re overweight, which also means you\u2019re producing too much estrogen, which is making it even harder for you to lose fat.\n\nYou might have mild depression \u2014 again, stemming from hormonal imbalances and low dopamine levels.\n\nAll of this means you\u2019re not healthy. You\u2019re aging faster.\n\nThis can typically also lead to prostate problems.\n\nSo at this point, you want to know what the solution is and how you can fix this.\n\nOf course, the typical suggestion most experts will tell you is that you need to go see a doctor.\n\nBut why? What are they going to do? Other than prescribing you some drug, maybe Viagra, which is only dealing with the symptoms, masking the problem, and only making things worse!!!\n\nSo, my suggestion is you immediately make some lifestyle improvements, quickly and naturally improve your testosterone levels, balance your negative hormones, and improve your blood flow.\n\nAnd you can literally see and feel the benefits within days and over the next few weeks and months, reverse this problem, and fix it long-term.\n\nThis means better health and better performance in the bedroom.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve got 2 important links I want you to take a look at right now, while it\u2019s fresh on your mind.\n\nThey will lead you to natural solutions and quick fixes.\n\nPlease take action now, before this situation, your libido, and your health, get worse!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nResources Mayo Clinic Staff.

    "content": "One of my most popular and shared articles done in 2025 revealed the #1 exercise for preventing erectile dysfunction and improving your \u201cperformance\u201d in the bedroom.\n\nAs a bonus benefit, this simple exercise \u2013 which can be performed anywhere, at any time\u2026 even while reading this article right now is also great for prostate health and incontinence \u2014 which is the loss of bladder control.\n\nSimple Exercise For Prostate Health\n\nThis exercise I\u2019m referring to is called Kegels, which can be performed by both men and women.\n\nAnd it\u2019s simply the act of strengthening your perineal muscles, which is the muscle between your genitals and anus.\n\nAnd the way you do this, as described in my original article, is that you just pretend you are holding in gas by contracting your anus. Or when you\u2019re peeing\u2026 when you stop the pee midstream, that\u2019s how the perineal muscle gets contracted.\n\nHOWEVER, I bring up today\u2019s topic because someone emailed me in a panic saying:\n\nDr Sam\u2026 I love you, but I\u2019m freaking out. I started doing the kegels you mentioned in your ARTICLE. It works super great. I also started adding the supplements you mentioned, and I\u2019m feeling awesome. I was getting crazy morning erections.\n\nBUT, now\u2026 the past few weeks, I\u2019m having major erection problems. I\u2019ve been kegeling every day, sometimes twice daily for 30 minutes each time. Like a \u201cdouble split\u201d workout. But doc, things just keep getting worse. I really have a hard time getting hard \u2013 if you know what I mean. No more morning erections. I also stopped taking AlphaViril and I\u2019m thinking of doing even more kegels to strengthen things even more. You know, like going to the gym, giving more attention to a weak body part. Please help me ASAP, this is causing problems with my girlfriend since we haven\u2019t had sex in a couple of weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting how guys think. If a little exercise works, they do more and more and more. And then if things don\u2019t work, they do even more and try to FORCE it.\n\nSo, the problem is you have basically \u201covertrained\u201d your perineal muscles by doing TOO many Kegels.\n\nBasically, too many sets, too many reps, too much volume.\n\nThus, that entire area is just tired. It\u2019s stressed out and thus, it is now weaker and can actually shrink in size.\n\nIt\u2019s no different than a muscle like your biceps or chest.\n\nYou train it, then you must back off, rest and recuperate, and let the muscles get stronger, grow in size, build more stamina, and so forth.\n\nTrust me, I think most people do this. They start to see positive results and then they do more to try and speed up the process. And when that doesn\u2019t work, they do even MORE to force progress.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t force anything in the body. Don\u2019t overstress it out.\n\nYou can only set the correct foundation and environment, and then let your body do the rest, naturally.\n\nSo, my suggestion is you STOP doing your Kegels for at least one week. I suggest two weeks.\n\nLet the area rest and let your body\u2019s hormones optimize again.\n\nThen, start back up and follow the exercise pattern, sets, and reps I mentioned in my original article about this.\n\nWHEN people follow my instructions and my \u201cprescription\u201d, they get great results \u2013 both short and more importantly, LONG-term.\n\nPlus, you put less effort and you save more time.\n\nI also suggest you start back on the AlphaViril and get your testosterone levels higher while lowering your negative stress hormones.\n\nWhen you notice your erections getting better and having more morning erections, you can start back up with the Kegels.\n\nSo there you have it. Make sure you also read my original article and a bonus FAQ kegels.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/does-watching-porn-increase-or-decrease-your-testosterone-levels/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve had the following question asked of me numerous times in 2025 \u2013 does watch porn increase or decrease testosterone levels?\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting question because the top 10 websites in the US always seem to include at least one porn site.\n\nThis means there are lots of people watching porn, especially when over 80% are men.\n\nNow, the answer to this question is even more interesting and it\u2019ll surprise you.\n\nFor example, one study showed that a man\u2019s testosterone levels shot up 35% because they watched porn. The increase in testosterone levels began about 15 minutes into watching porn and peaked about 90 minutes later.\n\nThe researchers also saw increased motivation, competitiveness, and a decrease in exhaustion.\n\nSo, that\u2019s the cool part.\n\nHowever, the study was based on guys WATCHING porn, but NOT having an orgasm.\n\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\nHow Does Orgasm Affect Me?\n\nI mention this because once you do have an orgasm, there are changes in your hormones.\n\nFirst, Prolactin levels shoot up. This is more of a female hormone and it controls sexual desire and how quickly you can get an erection and orgasm again.\n\nSecondly, Oxytocin levels also go up after orgasm.

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to give you a quick, summary on how to get bigger, harder, and more vascular-looking muscles.\n\nI\u2019ve got a more detailed article about this topic \u201c5 Proven Tips To Get Bigger, Harder, Vascular Looking Muscles\u201d.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re in a rush, here are 5 things you must do and the first is\n\nFirst of all, you can\u2019t look good if your muscles are covered by a layer of fat.\n\nSo the leaner you get, the bigger you\u2019ll look \u2013 especially with your shirt off.\n\nSo you need to get below 10% body fat to really start to see muscle definition, which will give that \u201cillusion\u201d that you\u2019re actually BIGGER than you really are.\n\nPlus, if you want to look hard, you\u2019ll need to strip off the fat, or else you\u2019ll look \u201csoft and watery\u201d.\n\nA muscle is made up mostly of water and blood and thus, most of is just water.\n\nSo, the more hydrated a muscle is, the bigger and fuller you\u2019ll look.\n\nPlus, with more water comes more blood volume, which will give you more vascularity and veins.\n\nThe way to get more water in the muscle is to eat more carbs and drink a lot more water.\n\nHowever, the real secret is you need to add Himalayan or Celtic salt to your meals and water, to help absorb the extra water into your muscle cells to fill them out and pump you up.\n\n#3 \u2013 Get Insulin Sensitive\n\nThere\u2019s nothing \u201cevil\u201d about carbohydrates. The real problem is high blood sugar.\n\nHowever, by improving insulin sensitivity, your blood sugar will not go up as much when you eat carbs. This means less insulin is secreted and thus, the food will go into your MUSCLE cells, instead of your fat cells.\n\nYou obviously need to lift weights to make your muscle grow and \u201cpop\u201d.\n\nLift both low and high reps.\n\nLift heavier weights for 6-8 reps for denser, harder-looking muscles.\n\nAs well as higher, 10-15 reps for more blood volume, vascularity, and roundness to your muscles.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t do strenuous cardio like running or jogging, or else your muscles will flatten out, lose their pop/fullness and you\u2019ll look \u201cskinny/fat\u201d.\n\nNone of this will do much if you don\u2019t have optimal hormonal balance.\n\nThis means higher testosterone \u2013 so you can build more muscle and have vascularity.\n\nYou also want to lower female hormones (estrogen, prolactin, etc.), so you\u2019ll have less fat.\n\nAnd finally, decrease stress hormones like Cortisol, so you don\u2019t lose muscle and don\u2019t hold water under the skin.\n\nThis is how steroids work.\n\nOf course, your goal is to do it naturally so you can look good ALL the time, year-round\u2026 Instead of going up and down in muscle and fat, while dealing with all the side effects of steroids (hair loss, zits, man boobs, etc.)\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "\"Increase My Libido & Testosterone\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb If you\u2019ve been reading any of my articles, you know how important hormones are to your health, fitness, and longevity. And for men, testosterone is the \u201cking\u201d of all hormones.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s been said that a man without testosterone is like a car without gasoline.\n\nSadly, today more men suffer from low testosterone than ever before in history and it\u2019s now considered an epidemic! Low testosterone (also called low T) can cause symptoms ranging from lack of sex drive, erectile problems, depression, and fatigue to irritability, memory loss, hair loss, and enlarged breasts and prostate.\n\nThe Cause Of Low Testosterone\n\nOf course, the #1 cause is just simple aging. However, the fact that things are getting worse and worse each year, shows that lifestyle is playing a major role in this problem.\n\nNow, in the past, I\u2019ve spoken about improvements you can make to your diet, exercise, and supplements\u2026. That will make instant improvements in your testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, today I want to focus on another major cause of lowered testosterone levels that most people don\u2019t talk about and that\u2019s your mobile phone and laptops. Basically, any device that\u2019s on \u201cwifi\u201d.\n\nDuring the past decade, while men\u2019s Testosterone levels have rapidly been declining, there\u2019s been a proportionate increase in the use of laptop computers and mobile phones. In fact, 92% of men own cell phones these days, while back in the year 2000, it was only 28%\n\nAnd the problem with these devices is that they\u2019re a major source of electromagnetic frequency (EMF) radiation, which can wreak havoc on a man\u2019s testosterone levels.\n\nNot only that, but they also cause a significant decrease in sperm motility and decreased fertility.1,2,3\n\nAnyway, there\u2019s no denying the fact these devices are castrating men. So, what\u2019s the solution?\u2026\n\nBasically, you need to stay away from WiFi connections.\n\nLaptop & \u201cTablet\u201d Solutions\n\nMen should never put their laptop on their lap unless there\u2019s a 12-inch cushion under the notebook, as this is about how far the EMF field transfers. EMF shields are also available to put under laptops, which protects the body from these dangerous frequencies. You can search online or on Amazon for one of these devices.\n\nThis ALSO includes tablet devices, so keep that in mind as well.\n\nTo keep cell phones from killing your testosterone, men should avoid storing their mobile phones near their groin area, unless it\u2019s on airplane mode.\n\nIt\u2019s best to store the phone far away from the testicles, either in a briefcase, car console, back pocket, front shirt, or coat pocket.\n\nKeep in mind that EMF radiation is twice as strong when in an area where reception is bad. The more power your phone uses to search for a tower, the more radiation it emits.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve heard about special \u201cshields\u201d you can put in your phones, to protect you from these EMF waves\u2026 but, I don\u2019t know how effective they are.\n\nSo, there you have it.. Do your best to stay away from WiFi connections.\n\nNow, these suggestions are good for preventing the decrease in your testosterone. But they do NOTHING for increasing your testosterone levels. Especially if you\u2019re over the age of 30.\n\nSo for that, make sure you click the links below about proven and natural ways of instantly increasing your testosterone levels, while also \u201cdecreasing\u201d negative, \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\n2012, the journal Fertility and Sterility\n\nCell Phones and Male Infertility: A Review of Recent Innovations in Technology and Consequences\n\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0692/1875/files/Challenging_cell_phone_impact_on_reproduction-_A_Review.pdf?3370\n\nChallenging cell phone impact on reproduction: A Review Zaher O.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/how-to-increase-dht-for-muscle-beard-growth/",
    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from a previous article I made entitled, \u201cWhy Increasing Testosterone Can Be BAD For You, Unless You Do THIS!\u201d.\n\nSo the question that was posed is: \u201cHow can I increase my DHT for more muscle gains and beard growth?\u201d\n\nJust a quick summary, DHT stands for DiHydroTestosterone. It\u2019s produced from testosterone, through an enzyme called 5-Alpha Reductase.\n\nSo the more 5a-Reductase enzyme you have, the more of your testosterone gets converted to DHT \u2013 which is also a male androgen.\n\nBoth men and women have it, but men have it in higher amounts.\n\nDoes DHT Increase Muscle Size?\n\nHowever, DHT does NOT produce very much muscle size at all.\n\nThe primary androgen/male hormone in skeletal muscle is testosterone, not DHT. And this is because DHT gets quickly deactivated at the muscle receptor by another enzyme called 3aHSD (3alpha-hydroxysteroid reductase).1-3\n\nSo, increasing your DHT will do nothing for increasing muscle size.\n\nIt will increase strength because it stimulates your Central Nervous System (CNS) and also increases aggression.\n\nIt will also make your muscles \u201charder\u201d because it lowers estrogen levels.1-3\n\nDHT Accelerates Hair Loss\n\nHowever, what DHT will do is increase body hair growth \u2014 including facial hair and beard. But keep in mind that it will also accelerate hair loss if that\u2019s part of your genetics.\n\nBut if you still want to increase your DHT, you\u2019ll need to ultimately increase your testosterone because the more testosterone you have, the more there is to \u201cconvert\u201d to DHT.\n\nThe rest is controlled by your genetics.\n\nAlso, aging increases your 5a-reductase enzyme, and thus, the older you get the higher your DHT levels. But unfortunately, it lowers your testosterone.\n\nIt can get a little complex, but I have a great video about this topic that I want you to watch. You\u2019ll discover IF you have low testosterone and how you can increase it naturally.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/36/2/247.full\n\nhttp://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/45/1/45.full.pdf\n\nhttps://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/reform8.htm",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health-se/review-of-2tx-testosterone/",
    "content": "As men age, their natural levels of testosterone begin to decrease. This natural reduction causes a number of symptoms that can range from a lower sex drive to unanticipated weight gain or just lower overall energy. If you\u2019re trying to stay away from hormone therapy, which is often recommended if living with children, then is there a product that can help guys naturally overcome these obstacles so they can feel like themselves again?\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what 2TX claims to be able to do. It works to amplify natural testosterone levels in a guy\u2019s body so that testosterone is maximized, estrogen is minimized, and energy levels are restored. Does it really do what it says it can do?\n\n2TX Works More Toward Converting What You Already Have\n\nWhat 2TX does is change how your body actually sees testosterone. It won\u2019t help your body produce more, which means your natural caps won\u2019t budge from their current levels, no matter what your age might be. What it does do is make is so that more of your testosterone is recognized as free testosterone, which can then be converted into what the body needs. It also blocks the conversion of this free hormone from DHEA into higher levels of estrogen, which other products don\u2019t have the ability to do.\n\nThis means that if you already have normal levels of testosterone and you\u2019re a fairly young guy, 2TX is going to be able to do much for you. What it will do is release this hormone from its proteins that bind it during transport so that more of it can be used freely instead of being predetermined for use by your body. If you\u2019re an older guy, however, this product could really work to help you feel more like yourself again.\n\nAre There Any Side Effects To 2TX?\n\nUnlike direct hormone therapies, guys aren\u2019t going to experience the negative side effects like smaller testicles or increased levels of acne when they take this product. The primary issue that guys face is that this product can sometimes cause an upset stomach and there might be issues with headaches, dizziness, or lightheadedness. Nausea has also been brought up as a complaint, but is more rare than the other listed side effects.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that 2TX isn\u2019t designed to give you superhuman muscles that have tons of mass. It\u2019s designed to instead help your body maintain current muscle mass while providing the means of increasing your overall stamina and sexual drive. If you\u2019re bulking up on calories to get huge muscles while taking this product, you\u2019ll end up packing on more fat than you will muscle tissue.\n\nThe bottom line is this: if you\u2019ve got decent T levels right now, this product isn\u2019t going to help you much. It might increase your free testosterone by a small percentage, but you probably won\u2019t feel it. If you have low T levels or are an older guy who is feeling less energetic, you might notice a big difference after a cycle or two of this product.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "For guys that are suffering from low testosterone levels, life can be downright miserable. Your muscles can feel weak and they might ache with every moment. Your joints can hurt. When it comes to sex, you just can\u2019t seem to sum up the desire to have it any more most days. You plod through life with low energy levels, so you spike your blood sugars with coffee, energy drinks, and high calorie snacks and begin gaining weight.\n\nThe good news is that with testosterone therapy provided by your doctor, these symptoms can go away and you can feel like yourself once gain once your hormone levels become stabilized. Two popular methods of therapy are through Sustanon 250 and Testosterone Enanthate. Which one is better to use?\n\nSustanon 250 Is the Most Popular Steroid\n\nHow popular is Sustanon 250? It is often given to all anabolic cycles, even though it is a specific kind. It contains four testosterone esters and is specifically designed to help create a quick response within the body. The typical dosage of this testosterone supplement is 250mg every week and is geared specifically toward guys who have low T levels already.\n\nSustanon 250 suppresses the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus and actually shuts down natural hormone production within the body even at low doses. For many guys, this means needing a staircase dosage of this hormone in order to keep maximizing their T levels. Doses can reach 1000mg per week, but the usual side effects of testosterone use multiply with higher levels of this injectible anabolic.\n\nWhat About Testosterone Enanthate?\n\nUnlike Sustanon 250, testosterone enanthate is a derivative of endogenous angrogen testosterone instead of being a combination of testosterone esters. This singular ester is designed to provide guys with higher levels of free testosterone as it actively works. It is usually given in a 200mg solution, so the dosage is lower than the base dosage of Sustanon and therefore reduces the long-term effects that hormone therapy can provide.\n\nThis therapy is almost as popular as Sustanon 250 and has been synthesized since 1935 from animal sources. It is also the most prescribed hormone therapy if you\u2019ve got low T levels that your doctor has recognized and the stimulation of better hormone production internally can begin with this ester. The added benefits of taking this anabolic are better energy, an increased sex drive, and the promotion of fat loss.\n\nIf you suffer from low T levels, then talking to your doctor about these two options is very important so you get the one that will maximize your overall hormone levels. If you\u2019re looking for a competitive edge, Sustanon 250 will give you fast, immediate results, but testosterone enanthate will be with you for the long haul in lower doses. For many guys, that\u2019s where the real advantage lies.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "As men age their testosterone level drops which make it harder for them to keep in shape and keep off the weight. However, there are a number of natural products that are said to actually boost the testosterone level in men which can help them maintain their physical condition and shed the extra pounds.\n\nFenugreek is a natural herb that has shown tremendous promise and has also been rumored to help boost testosterone in a man\u2019s body. However, does it really provide that type of help for men whose testosterone level has been dropping?\n\nFenugreek is an herb that has enjoyed a considerable amount of success over the years in terms of a health food product. For many years it was used by bodybuilders in the belief that it actually boosted the testosterone in the body to produce greater muscle mass. However, despite a few studies there has been no conclusive evidence that fenugreek actually boosts testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, there are a number of medicinal and culinary uses for this particular herb. There are many people who consume it as part of their daily diet. While many of the benefits come from anecdotal evidence, there is enough known to show that the herb itself is quite safe to take in a moderate amount.\n\nThe Effects of Fenugreek\n\nWhile fenugreek may react differently depending on the biochemistry of the person, the hormonal effect it has is generally similar to DHEA which is a potent phytoestrogen. This may be why some bodybuilders seem to have enjoyed a considerable positive effect from the herb even though it does not raise the level of testosterone in the body. However, some people have not enjoyed that type of effect because of their body chemistry.\n\nIn fact, there have been reports that estrogens levels in both men and women have risen thanks to the consumption of the herb. There have been cases of breast enlargement in both females and males because of consuming this product. It is little wonder thanks to the unpredictability of the effects that fenugreek is no longer considered a standard of body builders.\n\nThere are medicinal uses for fenugreek that include reducing skin inflammation, lowering the blood sugar in the body which is helpful for diabetics and also stimulating the lactation process in women. The effects on fenugreek have been well documented in these cases.\n\nOverall, fenugreek is a herb that has mostly positive effects on the body and when taken in moderate amounts creates little, if any unwanted side effects. What small amounts of side effects do occur are temporary in nature and will go away once a person stops consuming the herb.\n\nHowever, it is strongly recommended that when you first start taking the herb, do so in small amounts and gauge the effects. Once you feel comfortable that there are no unwanted side effects, you can increase the amount that is consumed gradually. Plus, it is wise to consult with your doctor first if you are taking any prescribed medications.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "There are a number of testosterone supplements out on the market today and some of them contain D-aspartic acid or DAA as one of the main ingredients. While this substance is known to help synthesize testosterone in the body, the overall effect is still not fully understood when used as a supplement.\n\nIt is however recommended that men ages 21 and under should not use the product and that anyone who does want to add it to their daily nutritional supplements should consult with their doctor first, especially if they are taking prescription medications.\n\nD-aspartic acid is an amino acid that the body uses to synthesize proteins. There are two essential forms of amino acids, L and D. The D form which comprises aspartic acid is used by the body in a variety of ways to help boost overall health. As to its ability to increase testosterone production, that is still under study.\n\nWhat is Aspartic Acid?\n\nThis is an amino acid that contains what is known as an acidic side chain. In other words, under normal circumstances the body itself produces aspartic acid on if there are enough amino acids that are being consumed. The L-aspartic acid version is known to help in the development of the molecules and structures to the formation of DNA.\n\nWhen it comes to the overall production of testosterone, the D version and not the L is used. One study performed by the University of Naples demonstrated that the D version of aspartic acid did have an effect on the production of testosterone in birds in an indirect manner, but that study was not performed on humans or mammals, so the results were not conclusive.\n\nThere have been numerous studies on animals, but those performed on humans have not shown the same results as the one that was done on birds. However, there have only been a relatively few number of studies that have been performed so there is no overall conclusion at this point. One small study that involved a few males showed an increase in free testosterone production of nearly 40%, a production level that only dropped by 10% after three days of no additional D-aspartic acid being consumed.\n\nSo far, there have been no long term studies performed on the overall effects of D-aspartic acid. Although most manufacturers of the product claim that it should be used for a period of time ranging from four to twelve weeks followed a cycling period of two to four weeks where it should not be consumed, there is no definitive proof that it does actually work.\n\nHowever, it is relatively safe to use when taken as directed and few, if any side effects have been reported. For many athletes and body builders who take the product, there are numerous stories that the product does indeed live up to its promise, although again no definitive studies have shown this to be true. It is also advisable that before taking this product you consult with your physician, especially if you are taking prescription medication.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "For those who take testosterone as part of their health improvement ritual, choosing between the different types that are available can be a difficult issue. When you consider the similarities between enanthate and cypionate, it may seem at first like a coin flip to select which one will work best for your needs.\n\nThe Similarities between Enanthate and Cypionate\n\nThere are certainly numerous similarities between each type of testosterone substance. For many, the similarities certainly outweigh the differences.\n\nTestosterone is Testosterone: This rather straightforward statement is true when it comes to enanthate and cypionate. Both are testosterone products and both are very similar in structure.\n\nSlow Acting: Both forms of this testosterone take about 10 days to 2 weeks to ester. For many of those who take testosterone, both choices are seemingly equal because they do have a similar effect on the body.\n\nFor men who have been prescribed testosterone to help improve their health, muscle tone and to shed some pounds as well, the differences between these two versions will make for an important choice.\n\nThe Differences between Enanthate and Cypionate\n\nAlthough very similar in many ways, there are some notable differences between these two substances that you will want to consider. However, there is an important geographical choice as enanthate is widely available around the world why cypionate is not very available outside the US.\n\nBodybuilder Statements: While anecdotal in nature and not as of yet officially verifiable, more bodybuilders prefer cypionate because it provides a greater \u201ckick\u201d, but it does increase water retention however.\n\nCarbon Ester Chains: Cypionate has 8 of these chains while enanthate has only 7. This more carbon that is present in the ester grouping, the less soluble it is in water, but it is more soluble in oil. What that means is that cypionate has a much longer active lifespan so it can be stored for longer periods of time.\n\nExpense: Most likely due to is lack of availability, cypionate is far more expensive that enanthate. This comes as no surprise and may be one of biggest factors in why more bodybuilders use enanthate in general. Plus, bodybuilders use enanthate much in the same way as anabolic steroids as well. While both forms have their advantages, many bodybuilders generally prefer enanthate because it avoids have that \u201cbloated\u201d look that comes with additional water retention. In addition, enanthate may be the only choice for many people as it is widely available and far less expensive than cypionate. So, in some ways the choice may be made for you if cypionate is not available in your area.\n\nFor those who are looking to shed the pounds and gain a sleeker appearance, enanthate is arguably the better of the two because it does not cause the body to retain water like cypionate. However, for those who want a bigger \u201ckick\u201d from the testosterone to help jump start the body, cypionate is arguably the better of the two.\n\nTaking testosterone substances needs to be done carefully and under supervision so that any signs of overuse or debilitating effects can be handled quickly before any real complications arise.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "One of the more interesting aspects of testosterone is that too much of it in the bodies of young men will often provide a negative view of the hormone because of the overly aggressive behavior that it may cause. However, in older men it is the lack of strong testosterone production that provides another negative view.\n\nThe truth is that as men age the levels of testosterone in their bodies goes down which can lead to a number of troubling issues that include low sex drive, the thinning of the bones and feelings of being tired most of the time. In fact, four out of ten men past the age of 45 have lower than normal testosterone levels which has led the popularity of testosterone injections as a substitute.\n\nBut does injecting testosterone into the body really have the effects that have been advertised? The truth is that while additional levels of testosterone does have some positive effects, they are not always positive and it is not the \u201cend-all, be-all\u201d treatment.\n\nThe Curious Results of Testosterone Replacement Therapy\n\nLow levels of testosterone causes the libido to sink and men have less interest in sexual relations. However, to increase the levels of testosterone does not cure erectile dysfunction or help men who want to procreate because it actually lowers the level of fertility. When the body has sufficient supplies of testosterone, the brain will then shut off the production of sperm which leads to lower fertility in men. For men who still want to procreate, testosterone therapy is certainly not the answer.\n\nIn addition, men who have breast or prostate cancer should not be give added levels of testosterone either as it may actually aggravate the condition. However, there are some positive results for restoring the normal levels of testosterone in the body itself.\n\nFor men who have low levels of energy and low sex drive, a simple blood test will determine if they have low levels of testosterone. If this is the case, then testosterone booster shots may be recommended. The symptoms of having low testosterone levels go beyond low energy levels to feelings of depression, loss of self confidence and an overall reduction of muscle and body mass as well. A man might decrease his work production rate as well.\n\nThere are factors other than aging with may lower a man\u2019s testosterone levels as well, which include depression or obesity. Turning around such conditions may lead to the increased production of testosterone in the body. There are also narcotic medications that may result in the body producing less testosterone as well.\n\nOptions for Testosterone Therapy\n\nWhile direct injections every two weeks is still common, there are other methods that can be used as well. Gels and patches that are applied to the skin will provide testosterone into the body which when taken on a daily basis can help properly boost the levels without the drop off that occurs with injections.\n\nMen who choose these options should ensure that the product is not touched by children or pregnant women as it may cause unwanted side effects. However, the use of testosterone injections can help raise energy levels and boost libido if done in the proper manner.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Men who have low levels of testosterone will often suffer from having low energy levels and low libido as well. As part of the aging process testosterone levels will drop similar to estrogen levels in women as they age. However, four out of ten men above the age of 45 will have lower than normal levels of testosterone which will need some form of treatment in order to raise those levels back up again.\n\nHowever, low testosterone levels are not so easy to diagnose because it is possible for a man to have normal levels of the total amount of testosterone in the body, but the portion of what is known as \u201cfree\u201d testosterone may be lacking. So, properly diagnosing the issue is important for replacement therapy to begin.\n\nThe Benefits of Raising Free Testosterone Levels\n\nThe most obvious benefit that is noticed is the increased interest in sex and turning back the clock when it comes to maintaining erections and the enjoyment of having orgasms. That is usually a good enough reason for many older men to want their testosterone levels returned to normal. However, there are other positive factors as well.\n\nOne of the more interesting studies that has been done concerned how men with lower than normal levels of testosterone may lead to a shorter life expectancy. It is known that low levels of testosterone in men contribute to level of obesity, diabetes and even osteoporosis all of which may contribute to a shorter life expectancy. Therefore, increasing the levels of testosterone back to their normal state may help in keeping these men living longer.\n\nIn addition, there have been studies that tie low testosterone levels to heart issues and ailments which again may affect the life expectancy of men. For many, restoring proper level of testosterone may have many beneficial effects.\n\nThe Risks of Boosting Testosterone Levels\n\nHowever, there are some risks in trying to artificially boost testosterone levels as well. Raising the amount of testosterone does incur some risks because of the effects on the body. What may be \u201cnormal\u201d levels for a man of a certain age does not mean that their bodies are going to react in an always positive manner.\n\nIncreasing testosterone levels will also increase the risk of blood clots and stroke which may have serious repercussions. Men with prostate cancer should not have their testosterone levels raised as it may lead to the spreading of the cancer in their bodies. In addition, other unusual side effects include the enlargement of the breast, acne and even sleep apnea which may present real issues as well. However, all such risks are greatly reduced if the treatment stops.\n\nOverall, the benefits of raising testosterone levels are much greater than the inherent risks if all the precautions are followed. For most men, boosting the levels of their testosterone will have the positive effects needed to overcome the issues of low libido and general tiredness that they are feeling. However, such benefits must be carefully considered and the proper diagnosis must be performed as well to ensure that the right treatment is provided.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "One of the more interesting conundrums is the relationship between testosterone levels and sperm count. Increasing the testosterone levels in a man will also increase his sex drive. However, raising such levels will also reduce his sperm count. This does seem counter intuitive, yet it is the case with men who take testosterone to help them in a variety of ways.\n\nIn addition, while low levels of testosterone stalls out the sex drive, it also contributes to erectile dysfunction as well although it is not the only cause.\n\nThe Benefits of Testosterone Injections\n\nThere are certainly many benefits that it can bring to the male body in addition to increasing the sex drive. As men age, they lose their natural muscle tone and gain excess weight. The correlation between muscle mass and fat starts to change and it become tougher for men to lose the excessive weight. In addition, energy levels get lower and it becomes even more difficult for men to get going.\n\nThe most obvious benefit is that testosterone levels are increased back to their normal levels. In older men, having higher testosterone levels means better preservation of the muscle mass. This can be enhanced with resistance exercises which help to increase the amount of muscle tissue.\n\nHigher testosterone levels also mean greater weight loss potential as well. This is because your muscles are now in better shape to help burn away the buildup of fat. With higher levels of testosterone, you can shed the excess weight with the proper diet and exercise pattern in a quicker fashion than without.\n\nThe Downside of Testosterone Injections\n\nHowever, it should be noted that increasing the levels of testosterone in your body will have some negative effects as well. If you are still interested in having children, then the increased amounts of testosterone will actually lower your sperm count and thus reduce the chances for procreation. In fact, increased levels of testosterone have actually been studied as a form of birth control since in 90% of men the sperm count actually drops to zero.\n\nThe sterility in men occurs when testosterone levels generally exceed their normal levels. This is because when additional testosterone is added, your brain signals that it has more than enough so it stops sending signals to the testes to create more which in turn shuts down the production of sperm as well. However, this is a temporary condition that lasts only as long as injections of testosterone are being placed in your body.\n\nIn normal doses they can actually help in the development of sperm. The male brain creates a special hormone that causes more testosterone to be developed in order for a healthy amount of sperm to be present in the body.\n\nOverall, getting testosterone injections should be the result of getting tested for your current levels and discussing with your doctor the right option for your lifestyle. If you are past the point of desiring children and have low testosterone levels, then you should consider therapy that includes injections of testosterone in your body.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Although it may seem like a relatively new movement, the truth is that testosterone boosters have been around since the 1930\u2019s in various forms. By the 1960\u2019s athletes began to experiment by increasing the amount of testosterone in their bodies. However, by the end of the 20th century there were great concerns over the use of performance enhancing products in terms of their safety and use.\n\nThe result of this new movement which has banned such products as human growth hormone and steroids, athletes and those interested in creating greater performance through natural means are now using testosterone boosters. Basically, this is a way for athletes to boost the levels of testosterone in their system without using any illegal performance enhancing drugs or substances.\n\nOne of the more interesting products is Dr. Max Powers Testosterone Booster. This is a product that is enjoying considerable popularity and is being used by athletes and regular people alike to provide a natural boost to their testosterone levels. But what exactly is this substance, what are the advantages and potential drawbacks that it provides? In fact, does this product even work as advertised?\n\nWhat is Dr. Max Powers Testosterone Booster?\n\nEssentially, this product is a combination of herbs and other natural supplements that is designed to boost the levels of testosterone in men in a natural fashion. While men of adult ages can use this product, it is really designed for two groups, men over the age of 40 and athletes to naturally boost their own testosterone levels for better performance.\n\nAfter passing the age of 40, men start to lose their testosterone levels and become more vulnerable to gaining weight. This is especially true if they do not exercise or eat a healthy diet. The Dr. Max Power product is designed to combine different natural herbs and other elements that will stimulate the body into producing higher amounts of testosterone. Because all of the ingredients used are natural and deemed safe, this product does not fall under normal drug guidelines.\n\nThe Advantages of the Testosterone Booster\n\nThere are certainly a number of advantages when it comes to this particular product, most notably the fact that it attempts to use natural products to get the body to perform better overall when taken in the recommended dose.\n\nProven Ingredients: The herbs and supplements that are found in this product have all been used in other products as well. They are proven to be safe with few side effects when taken in the recommended amounts.\n\nTribulus: This is one ingredient that has shown to have positive effects on the male body and helps to simulate raised testosterone levels. For many years, bodybuilders and athletes have been using tribulus as part of their daily diet regimen. The result has been improved overall growth in muscle mass and greater energy as well.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that this product is rather expensive and does seem to rely considerably upon name recognition as much as the qualities of the ingredients themselves. While effective, it is priced at a level where some may deem it too expensive. The bottom line, tribulus is an ingredient you can find in other supplements for less money. However, the Dr. Max Power Testosterone Booster does work in terms of improving your overall health.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

The gel has been around for the past several years and is designed to be an alternative to the traditional testosterone injection shots.\n\nBut does the gel really work as promised? Plus, is it a safe, effective alternative to the injections which have been the preferred therapy for years? What follows is a breakdown of the positives and potential negatives of men using this gel to replace their testosterone.\n\nBasically, this is a clear, translucent gel that is a topical application to the skin. In this manner, men who have low testosterone levels will receive this supplement though the skin which will avoid direct injections. The gel is normally applied to the dry skin of the shoulders and upper arms in the appropriate amounts. Once applied, it is recommended that men wash their hands before the come into contact with women or children who have a slight risk of absorbing any excess testosterone.\n\nThe general dosage is about 5 grams per day which can be applied. As a topical solution, a precise amount may never be made but it is generally close enough for it to work.\n\nBenefits of Lowtiyel Testosterone Gel\n\nThere are a number of benefits available thanks to this particular product, most of which is designed for middle aged men who have suffered from low testosterone levels.\n\nEasy to Apply: Compared to direct testosterone injections, applying the gel is painless and effective. It is very easy to apply and does not carry the pain or annoyance of having direct injections.\n\nEffective Results: Since the testosterone in the gel is absorbed through the skin, this product does work in the manner described. Daily applications will all be absorbed at roughly the same rate as long as they are applied to the same area of the body.\n\nEven Control of Testosterone: Unlike injections which are performed every couple of weeks with larger amounts of testosterone, the gel provides the daily amount.\n\nThe Disadvantages of the Gel Product\n\nHowever, there are a few disadvantages of this product as well. Although, it should be pointed out that these are minor issues which can easily be avoided.\n\nIrritation of the Skin: For almost all men the gel will not carry any side effects to the skin because it is basically a combination of testosterone and an alcohol gel which will melt away. However, there are a few men with sensitive skin who may suffer from some irritation. In this case, you may have to switch to direct injections.\n\nFlammable: All alcohol gels are flammable, so you will have to be careful not to be around an open flame while applying this gel.\n\nPassing on Testosterone: If the gel is touched by other members of your family, such as your wife or children they may suffer from some adverse side effects. While the chances are very small, you will have to remember to wash your hand with soap after using the product.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Or is it just another scam that could end up harming you instead of helping you?\n\nThe Good News: Geofman Testosterone Enanthate Is a Legit Substance\n\nGeofman Testosterone Enanthate is a legitimate product that is produced. Although it may be banned by law in certain locations around the world or only available legally through a prescription, it will provide you with a cycle that can help you achieve legitimate results. As with any injectable, you will want to focus on diet and sleep just as much as you focus on the intensity and length of your workouts. Those who see the best results from this product emphasize those three points.\n\nAs a side result, many guys who take this injectable also report having an increased libido in addition to being able to lose weight or build muscle. The body amps up its metabolism while on each cycle so that it can burn or build so that your body can trim out.\n\nThe Not So Good News: Quality Control\n\nOne of the biggest issues that Geofman Testosterone Enanthate face is quality control of the merchandise. This might be why many of the user reviews of this product are mixed. Some people experience great results and say that they would never use another product ever again. Others say that the product is just a scam and not worth the money.\n\nIt is made by an authentic pharmaceutical manufacturer, but there do not seem to be any controls in place to make sure that the quality of the product is the same. Even a full cycle may have different quality ampules within it, but many reviews testify that even test cycles can provide surprisingly good gains.\n\nThe Bad News: There Are Lots of Counterfeits\n\nThe problem with Testosterone Enanthate is that there are a lot of counterfeit products that are out on the market today. It\u2019s very possible for users to have been fooled by a fake product, but thought they were taking the authentic thing. This could explain some of the poor reviews that can be found about this injectable steroid.\n\nWith only one or two injections per week, Geofman Testosterone Enanthate can help to promote protein synthesis so that fat is burned and muscle mass is built. As a direct result, some users may have increases in cholesterol levels and without an anti-estrogen supplementing the testosterone, a higher risk of estrogen conversion that can actually lead to fat gains instead.\n\nWhen taken appropriately, most users will find the results they want with Geofman Testosterone Enanthate.

Most of the time true fatigue isn\u2019t achieved, which means the workout isn\u2019t as effective as it could be. For those who are looking to get a true competitive edge, Bullnox Testosterone Booster looks to be a supplement to add directly to your stack. It\u2019s a nitric oxide drink mix that is designed to give you a rush of energy right before your workout so that you can finish strong all day long.\n\nWhat Is the Primary Ingredient of Bullnox?\n\nEven though this product is called a testosterone booster, it would be more accurate to call it a nutritional supplement. The goal is to increase the levels of creatine that are available to your muscle groups before a workout begins. Your muscles have a certain level of energy that is supplied to them every day naturally. Bullnox increases the top amount of energy that the muscles can contain, which is why workouts can be longer and more effective.\n\nThe primary active ingredient in Bullnox is L-Arginine. You\u2019ll also find some of the vitamins and minerals that you need anyway in this drink mix as well. Potassium, magnesium, and zinc lead the way. The reason for the feeling of an \u201candrorush\u201d isn\u2019t because of a testosterone boost, however, because there are heavy levels of caffeine that can be found in this drink mix.\n\nWhen taken appropriately, most users are going to find that they\u2019ll feel great during their workout and be able to still have energy afterward. With the higher levels of caffeine, however, it is also important to make sure fluid intake levels are balanced since the stimulant acts as a diuretic.\n\nWhat Makes Bullnox Stand Out From Other Supplements?\n\nBecause this isn\u2019t an actual steroid, there is no cycling that is required when Bullnox is being taken. It can be added to your daily supplement stack so that you can achieve the exact results you want. The only word of caution is to avoid drinks, foods, and medication that may contain caffeine in them or have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nYou\u2019ll also receive three different forms of creatine, which is a naturally occurring substance that is found in the proteins that are consumed. It is just highly concentrated so that the body can get an enhanced result and more overall muscle energy from its consumption.\n\nIt is also specifically designed to promote nitric oxide and protein synthesis so that you can trim out, bulk up, and do so without consuming a ton of sugar or experience a bunch of side effects in the process. Every serving of Bullnox is just 50 calories.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an effective and affordable way to enhance your workout results and even potentially lose some weight, then the Bullnox testosterone booster could be the exact product that you need. It works consistently, is widely available, and offers everyone a comprehensive solution so that every workout can be great.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "The TGen Testosterone booster is a product from Chamonix that promises to support and arguably increase testosterone levels in men. TGen is designed primarily for older men who have already experienced a drop in the level of testosterone that is in their bodies. For men who want to increase their strength, muscle definition and lose the excess fat while also boosting the libido, TGen promises to be the type of natural product that will deliver results.\n\nWhat is true is that men do lose testosterone over their lives and those who manage to stave off the drop or even boost the amount they have in their system will experience more pronounced libido, greater energy and improvements in losing weight. However, boosting testosterone levels through the use of natural ingredients is one that has proven to be difficult to achieve.\n\nWhat TGen Testosterone Booster Contains\n\nThis product contains a number of minerals and herbs which are designed to help the body increase the amount of testosterone produced. This makes the product targeted towards older me and body builders in particular who want to get the most out of their workouts by raising up the levels of testosterone in the body.\n\nDoes TGen Really Work?\n\nUnfortunately, about the only true testosterone booster is testosterone itself which is prescribed by a doctor. TGen testosterone booster offers a number of excellent minerals, vitamins and herbs which certainly supports the functions of the body, but they do not really boost testosterone production to any significant degree.\n\nWhat TGen does do is help support the level of testosterone that your body does produce. In order to maximize the effect of the product, you will need to be in good physical condition and eating a healthy diet as well. For men who want to get the most out of what they have, then this product can offer a means to help you lose some excess weight and provide the nutritional support needed to get the most out of your body.\n\nThe product is safe when taken in normal amounts, although you will want to check with your doctor in case you are taking any prescribed medication to avoid any unnecessary interaction. However, this is a rather expensive product that may not deliver the results that you want, especially if you are looking at losing a considerable amount of weight.\n\nThere are no official studies that have determined TGen Testosterone Booster will actually help you shed the unwanted fat, at least not without engaging in a healthy diet and exercise program which will probably do the most work in that area. If you are in need of an actual boost in your testosterone levels, then you will need to see a doctor to get them measured properly.\n\nOtherwise, TGen Testosterone Booster is a nice, natural product that can provide some healthy benefits, but in a package that does cost a considerable amount of money. If you take a little time, you can find most of the ingredients listed in other products that cost considerably less if you so desire.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "There is little doubt that testosterone replacement products are all the rage on the internet. With more studies showing the link between the drop in men\u2019s testosterone level as they age with higher than normal weight, less energy and low sex drive, it is little wonder that a number of products have hit the shelves promising to increase a man\u2019s ability to produce testosterone.\n\nAndractim Testosterone Gel is one such product that promises to help men boost their testosterone levels naturally as they age. However, while mainly marketed towards older men the product is also targeted at those who are bodybuilders or just want a boost to what they naturally produce. Andractim Testosterone Gel is a product that is actually a prescribed version of medication that applied topically to the skin rather than internally.\n\nHowever, since the concentration level of the active ingredients is much lower than the prescription version, this product can be sold over the counter.\n\nWhat Andractim Testosterone Gel Contains\n\nWhile most gels are synthetic testosterone, Andractim uses Dihydrotestonerone or DHT which is a version of testosterone that is more readily absorbed in the body especially through the skin. This means that unlike many natural or herbal products, this is actually feeding your body the testosterone it wants in order to boost the sex drive, increase lean muscle mass and also improve the overall energy and mood of a man as well.\n\nThere are many effects that are attributed to this product as well as fewer side effects such as the enlargement of breast tissue or growth of the prostate. In many ways, this product does seem like the answer that many men have been looking for, especially the ones who want to enjoy more muscle mass while losing the excess fat.\n\nThe fact is that it does work, although it will actually encourage more hair loss in men who have male pattern baldness. Plus, you do not want other members of your family to come into contact with the product, such as children or women as it might cause a number of unexpected side effects.\n\nThere is no prescription needed and its purpose is to restore the balance of male to female hormones in the body. It has been linked with correcting the effects of gynomastia and may even cause penis growth in certain men as well. However, this product is only for men who actually need a boost in their testosterone which can only be determined by a doctor running the appropriate tests, so it is advisable to see your physician first to understand if this is the product that you really need.\n\nIt is a powerful product that arguably should only be used in the short term as no long term studies have been performed. However, there is little doubt to the effectiveness of Andractim Testosterone Gel when used in the proper amounts to help boost testosterone levels which in turn should assist in the dropping of the unnecessary fat from the body.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "For men who are passing their middle-30s, the amount of testosterone flowing through their system is just not the same as it was in their late teens and early 20s. Basically, the body produces less testosterone as men age which means that they feel less energy, less sex drive and that they retain more body fat as well.\n\nThere are basically two choices for men in this predicament, either get a testosterone supplement that provides the extra boost needed to return to their more youthful days or use a product that is designed to boost testosterone levels naturally within the body.\n\nWhen it comes to the latter, Text WORx Testosterone supplement is designed to not only boost production levels, but actually free up the testosterone that has been trapped in the fat cells as well. This dual approach has made the product quite popular and provides an additional boost for its users with its unique approach.\n\nTest WORx uses a blending of EuryPeptides that prevents SHBG production which works to bind testosterone to the fat cells. By limiting its production, the product actually keeps more of testosterone produced in the body working for you rather than just being stored away.\n\nMore free testosterone means that your energy levels increase along with your sex drive while lean muscle mass will also rise if you work out. This can even affect your mood in a positive manner as well since you are now looking better and feeling more energetic.\n\nThe ingredients in Test WORx are as follows:\n\nIt is recommended that you cycle on and off Test WORx in regulated periods so that you minimize any chance of side effects. So, while taking the product it is recommended that you consume it for five days straight and then take two days off. After completing the bottle, wait one week before taking it again.\n\nIs Test WORx Right for You?\n\nUnlike many other similar products, Test WORx actually combines the use of different herbs and ingredients that boosts its properties so that it can really deliver the results. There is little doubt that the formula itself is one that is designed to work while the cycling period allows the body to recover properly before the next dose of the ingredients hit.\n\nPlus, the product has gotten a large number of supporting reviews by customers, though in fairness there are many who do not like the product or feel that it doesn\u2019t live up to its promises. It is rather expensive to purchase which makes buying it somewhat problematic because it might take two or three months before the effects really begin to show.\n\nGiven the money back guarantee that is offered, for those who are looking at a natural way to add more testosterone into their system, Test WORx is one that offers a unique path of not so much boosting the production level, but keeping more of it in the body so that it can be used to help lose weight and provide greater energy.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health-se/mirena-versus-paragard/",
    "content": "Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are a safe and easy to maintain way to prevent pregnancy. They are slowly growing in popularity in the United States right now, so many women have questions about which IUD they should be using. Family planners and doctors are using and recommending two IUDs in particular right now: Mirena and ParaGard.\n\nWhich one is right for you? Let\u2019s first take a look at what these two IUDs have in common.\n\nMirena and ParaGard Both Provide These Benefits\n\nMireana and ParaGard are both very effective at what they do. It\u2019s one of the most effective methods of birth control outside of 100% abstinence or having a surgery to permanently prevent pregnancy. They are able to be used for a year or more without taking pills or shots and work for most women. This includes women who haven\u2019t had their first child.\n\nBoth IUDs also have these features in common.\n\n1. They are very small. Both Mirena and ParaGard are shaped like a small T. It\u2019s about the size of a small MP3 player and most women don\u2019t even feel that it has been implanted.\n\n2. They are affordable. Most health insurance plans will cover these IUDs. Some family planning clinics also offer them for free. It is also cheaper than many forms of birth control and it\u2019s definitely cheaper than having an unintended pregnancy.\n\n3. They install quickly. It only takes about a minute for an IUD to be placed. Many women compare the feeling to that of a pap smear.\n\nIt is important to note that an IUD will not prevent a sexually transmitted disease or infection. Only condoms have this ability. No matter which one you choose, the outcome is generally the same. Women have a long-term method of birth control that is highly reliable.\n\nThe primary benefit of choosing Mirena is that it doesn\u2019t contain any estrogen. For women who are used to the hormonal changes that occur with a birth control pill, the relief of not having the swings is incredible during the first month. Mirena is powered by progesterone and it acts within the uterus only so there aren\u2019t whole body side effects. A properly installed IUD from Mirena can last for up to 5 years.\n\nMirena does take some time to begin working. For many women, it is about 90-180 days. During this adjustment period, there may be frequent periods of light bleeding that occur. Sometimes the IUD may shift, but this is generally when it hasn\u2019t been properly placed. The periods can become unpredictable during this time as well, but after 6 months, Mirena generally stops a period altogether.\n\nIf the periods do not stop, then they become lighter and more regular and have less pain. For women who might worry they are pregnant if they don\u2019t have their period monthly, then ParaGard may be a better choice.\n\nParaGard will initially cause periods that are long, heavy, or involve heavy levels of cramping. Like Mirena, it may take up to 180 days for ParaGard to begin having its full effect. When it does happen, the periods will return to a more normal state and pattern. It isn\u2019t suitable for women who have a lack of iron in their blood.\n\nParaGard may last for up to 12 years after being implanted. It works thanks to a copper filament that has been wrapped around the device. There are no hormones involved at all with this IUD and is recognized as the only highly effective method of birth control that doesn\u2019t use hormones in any way.\n\nWhich Is Right For You?\n\nIf you\u2019re considering Mirena or ParaGard, then speak with your doctor today about what the best options may be for you. Women who are already having difficult periods will want to opt for Mirena because ParaGard will enhance flow and cramps for the first 3-6 months. Women who want a very long-term solution, however, may wish to consider ParaGard first, especially if they have hormonal sensitivities.\n\nThe cost of one of these IUDs may be as high as $1,000 up front. It must be inserted by a medical professional. Women who have never had a baby are at the greatest risk of having an IUD slip out and potentially cause an infection. All women may have a medical professional improperly place an IUD and have it push through the uterine wall to cause other potential health problems.\n\nOnly you and your doctor together can decide which product is suitable for your health. Use this guide to create questions to ask your doctor today so that you can take care of your birth control needs in the most effective way possible.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

By raising levels of serotonin in the body, you tend to feel calmer and less anxious.\n\nHowever, serotonin also decreases your \u201cdrive\u201d \u2013 emotional drive as well as sexual drive.\n\nIn many ways, it\u2019s the opposite of another neurotransmitter called, Dopamine\u2026 which incidentally, antidepressant drugs decrease.\n\nYes, Dopamine is called the \u201cfeel good\u201d hormone or neurotransmitter.\n\nMost importantly, SSRIs actually decrease testosterone and increase estrogen.\n\nTestosterone controls sexual desire in all animals.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Solution\n\nWell, I can\u2019t give you medical advice here\u2026 So, please speak to your doctor.\n\nHowever, I can report to you what\u2019s worked for many other people.\n\nLower The Dose Remember, drugs are SUPER powerful, a little goes a long way.\n\nChange Timing Even though many of these drugs have a long half-life, you might consider taking the drug AFTER you have sex.\n\nTake Natural Solutions There are natural herbs and vitamins that also help improve serotonin levels and other neurotransmitters, that\u2019ll create a calming effect, happier feelings, more confidence, and control.\n\nHowever, they won\u2019t cause sexual side-effects because they work naturally WITH your body, unlike drugs that artificially work AGAINST your body.\n\nOne of the most popular mood-enhancing solutions is called ProVanax. It naturally helps balance important neurotransmitters, without the sexual side effects.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re a guy, you for sure want to improve your testosterone levels and balance your hormones\u2026 This will really make a huge difference and improvement in performance, sexual desire, and erections.\n\nAgain, my favorite and most popular solution is AlphaViril. It\u2019s an all-in-one solution that I\u2019ve personally been using for over 20+ years.\n\nThe good news is that both of these natural supplements are safe to take with your antidepressants and SSRIs.\n\nOf course, you should always speak to your doctor first.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health-se/hgh-pros-and-cons/",
    "content": "When it comes to building up muscle tissue, one of the more interesting developments in recent years is the use of HGH. Injections of HGH are considered illegal for most professional sports as it gives physical advantages, but for everyday use from helping people to lose fat and feel more energetic, HGH has become quite popular in recent years.\n\nStanding for Human Growth Hormone, HGH is a natural hormone that is generated by the pituitary gland during our childhood and teen years. As we age into adults the production of HGH will slow down dramatically, but it actually does not go away as we retain the ability to generate HGH well into our senior years. However, the loss of HGH does more than just affect our growth as it also causes signs of the aging process where we lose energy, the weakening of bones and muscle tissue along with the appearance of wrinkles and even memory loss.\n\nWhat Are the Pros of HGH?\n\nThere are a number of benefits to taking HGH hormones which is why you will find them in so many consumer products.\n\nGreater Energy Levels: Arguably the most noticeable benefit is the increased energy levels that help people feel younger and more alive. This means that people can get more done during the day and actually sleep better at night when using this increased energy.\n\nBetter Weight Loss: Greater energy means higher metabolism and the burning away of excess fat when eating a healthy diet and engaging in proper exercise.\n\nImproved Health and Body Function: Taking HGH in the proper dosage is in some ways like turning back the clock with an improved immune system, better body function and overall increased energy and sex drive.\n\nWhat Are the Cons of HGH?\n\nHowever, despite all the benefits there are some disadvantages to taking HGH, so the consumer will need to be aware before deciding on going with this program.\n\nCost: HGH injections cost a considerable amount of money and a typical year-long session will reach into the thousands of dollars. You can expect to visit the medical practitioner several times a month just to maintain the therapy.\n\nReduced HGH Production: Because you are getting HGH from an outside source, your own pituitary gland will shut down the production of your natural HGH. This means that once you cut back or stop using the HGH injections, your body will rapidly return to its former state because it is no longer producing any HGH.\n\nIncreased Health Risk: Studies have shown that increased levels of HGH above what is normal for the body puts you at risk of joint inflammation, deformities in bone growth, high blood pressure and even diabetes.\n\nAll things considered, the natural production of HGH from your pituitary gland is a much safer and natural way to get all the benefit rather than taking outside injections. If you can find ways to have the natural production increased, then you can reap the same benefits with far fewer drawbacks. Overall, taking HGH injections should be reserved for those who are recommended to do so under a doctor\u2019s care.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

And as a testosterone booster, it does work and there are many clinical studies backing it up\u201d\n\nMost Supplements Don\u2019t Work\n\nAnd the truth is that yes, most testosterone-boosting supplements or ingredients don\u2019t work.\n\nAnd even if you select the right one, most companies use the wrong form, extract, and dose \u2013 so, it ends up not working at all and is a waste of money.\n\nThis even includes Tongkat Ali or Long Jack because it has to be harvested during the right time of the year and at the correct 100:1 extract needs to be used, so that you can maximize the different phytochemicals (plant chemicals) found in this herb, which can help promote optimal testosterone boosting.\n\nAnd even though most supplements and ingredients don\u2019t work, there are FEW other herbal extracts that work directly with Tongkat Ali to further boost and maximize your testosterone levels.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve stated in previous videos, your only goal should NOT be to increase your testosterone levels \u2026 should ALSO include:\n\nIncreasing your FREE testosterone as well\n\nBalancing your female hormones, such as various estrogens and prolactin\n\nControl excessive DHT levels for healthy prostate function\n\nYour goal should be optimal and youthful hormonal balance!\n\nTake a look at the formula I\u2019ve been using for over 22+ years.\n\nAlso, since today\u2019s topic was about Viagra, you might also want to look at another video I made entitled, \u201c#1 Natural Alternative To Viagra\u201d \u2026\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/real-truth-about-horny-goat-weed-natural-viagra-testosterone-libido/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions about a herb called, Horny Goat Weed\u2026\n\nWhat are the real benefits?\n\nIs it really like a \u201cnatural Viagra\u201d?\n\nDoes it increase testosterone?\n\nWill it help improve or fix my erectile dysfunction/problems?\n\nHow does it really work?\n\nWhat\u2019s the best kind?\n\nSo, let me address all of these questions. But, let me first just give you a quick overview of what Horny Goat Weed is.\n\nWhat Is Horny Goat Weed?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s been said that it has received its name from a goat herder who noticed his flock of goats becoming more sexually active after eating this plant. Hence the name, \u201chorny goat weed\u201d.\n\nThe use of Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium) as a medicinal herb dates back to at least 400 A.D., where it has been used as a:\n\ntonic for the reproductive system (boosting libido and treating impotence)\n\nFor optimizing hormone levels (testosterone, estrogen, and cortisol)\n\nand as a \u201crejuvenating tonic\u201d (to relieve fatigue)\n\nIt is interesting to note that although at least fifteen active compounds have been identified in the Horny Goat, epimedium extracts, (luteolin, icariin, quercetin, and various epimedins), the specific icariin extract is noted for stimulation of the sex drive and reduction of cortisol levels (stress hormones).\n\nWhat Are The Benefits Of Horny Goat Weed?\n\nIt\u2019s been used for a variety of health benefits, some of them being:\n\nOsteoarthritis (joint pain)\n\nOsteoporosis (bone health)\n\nAs you can see, it has a lot of potential benefits. However, today I want to focus more on the ones associated with improving hormone levels and sex drive.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s been noted to help improve testosterone levels indirectly, by primarily decreasing the stress hormone, Cortisol.\n\nMost people don\u2019t know that the opposite of testosterone is NOT the female hormone, estrogen \u2013 but the STRESS hormone, cortisol.\n\nMany people refer to horny goat weed as a \u201cnatural Viagra.\u201d Now, there are no human, clinical studies showing this.\n\nHowever, there are many people who can vouch for the positive \u201cerection-enhancing\u201d qualities. Especially when you get the correct form and dosage\u2026 and is combined with other, key herbs\u2026 which I\u2019ll get to in a minute.\n\nNow, it works \u201clike Viagra\u201d because it\u2019s been shown to be a mild, PDE5 inhibitor, which is exactly how Viagra works \u2014 but, obviously Viagra is a lot more potent.\n\nIt\u2019s also been shown to improve blood flow and circulation, by helping to thin out the blood.\n\nYes, but only when you use the correct dosage and extract form, which is true for all products. In this case, it must be 60% Icariin extract.\n\nIn all honesty, I\u2019ve found that almost all of the supplements you purchase online are using the INCORRECT dosage and extract form. Just cheap junk or root powder, which doesn\u2019t work.\n\nPlus, Horny Goat Weed works MUCH better when combined with other ingredients that help balance out your hormones. And that\u2019s the secret and I\u2019ll get to this in a minute.\n\nYes, it is. Most of what you purchase these days contains junk \u2013 it won\u2019t do anything. So, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s unsafe, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a waste of money.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Kind?\n\nAs stated earlier, there are at least fifteen active compounds that have been identified in the Horny Goat, epimedium extracts, (luteolin, icariin, quercetin, and various epimedins).\n\nThe most potent one is the specific icariin at 60% extract, which is noted to stimulate of the sex drive, increase testosterone, and reduce cortisol levels (stress hormones).\n\nIs Horny Goat Weed FDA Approved?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not \u2013 no supplement is. Remember, FDA stands for FOOD and DRUG \u2013 horny goat weed isn\u2019t either of these.\n\nHowever, you do want to purchase a product that has clinical studies backing the formula. A supplement that\u2019s been manufactured in an FDA-approved facility. One that comes with a Certificate Of Analysis (CoA), which confirms that the ingredients on the label are actually what\u2019s inside the bottle. 99% of companies don\u2019t offer this.\n\nHowever, at the end of this article, I\u2019ve listed the one that I use, which meets all of these criteria.\n\nWill it improve my hormones, testosterone levels, and sex drive?\n\nAs stated earlier, when used by itself and because most of the products out there is junk, I don\u2019t see it working.\n\nHowever, if you get the correct form, dosage, and extract, COMBINED with other ingredients that are shown to help optimize the primary hormones and enzymes needed to boost your testosterone and libido, then it does work.\n\nJust like everything in health \u2013 it\u2019s never ONE type of diet or vegetable or workouts. It\u2019s about the combination.\n\nAnd because of this, I\u2019ve listed the best ingredients, dosage, and formula for you.\n\nIt\u2019s the same formula that I personally have used for almost 20 years.\n\nJust copy it, use it for yourself, and let me know how much your testosterone and libido have improved.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/new-science-about-caffeine-erections/",
    "content": "I recently did an article about how caffeine, energy drinks, and stimulants decrease testosterone levels and cause hormonal imbalances.\n\nThis led to a lot of different questions, but one that was repeated a couple of times was, \u201cDoes caffeine increase erections? Is it good for Erectile Dysfunction? I heard a study saying it is?\u201d\n\nMy first reaction and thought were, \u201cno, it\u2019s not! I clearly stated in the article why it\u2019s not, how it\u2019s bad for your hormones and thus, can lead to erectile dysfunction\u201d\n\nHowever, I didn\u2019t want to blindly dismiss the question. I obviously don\u2019t know everything and I want to learn as much as possible.\n\nAs stated before, this website is for YOU and about YOUR needs. So, I dug deeper.\n\nI then discovered one study1 in 2015, stating that men who drank about 170-375 milligrams (mg) of caffeine per day were less likely to report erectile dysfunction (ED) than those who didn\u2019t. This is about 2-3 cups of coffee.\n\nThey wrote that the \u201csuggested biological mechanism is that caffeine triggers a series of pharmacological effects that lead to the relaxation of the penile arteries and the cavernous smooth muscle that lines cavernosal spaces, thus increasing penile blood flow.\u201d 2\n\nIn other words, arteries and smooth muscle relaxation, blood flow is enhanced, and the \u201ccavernous\u201d space in the penis that contributes to erection, fills with blood more easily.\n\nOkay, this sounds like a nice theory.\n\nThe researchers ALSO noted, that they \u201cweren\u2019t able to find a connection between caffeine and increased blood flow\u201d. Thus, all of this means nothing.\n\nAs with most clinical studies, there are always flaws and poorly set up.\n\nI did look deeper into the \u201cblood flow\u201d theory and there are some studies showing improved blood flow to the brain because of caffeine. And yet later, other studies show the opposite effect, causing vasoconstriction and thus, poorer blood flow.3\n\nSo, any positives were later negated.\n\nThe bottom line is that none of this means anything.\n\nAs stated in my original article, stimulants like caffeine causes an increase in stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline/epinephrine levels, which will decrease testosterone and THIS will always cause a decrease in erections.\n\nNot to mention, caffeine also increases anxiety, which decreases performance.\n\nYour goal is that you always want to improve your hormones, that\u2019s it!\n\nOptimal hormone levels and balance is the BEST long-term, natural solution for improved health and erections.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple concept, yet complicated to implement.\n\nI\u2019ve got two important links that you should check out today. One is to the original article for anyone who takes caffeine products such as coffee, energy drinks, pre-workout stimulants or similar products.\n\nAnd another is a clinically researched solution that helps improve your hormones, and increases testosterone, leading to better erections and sex drive \u2013 physically and emotionally.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123547\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748160/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19219847",

    "content": "So the other day I was asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s worse, smoking or taking steroids\u201d? Surprisingly, I\u2019ve been asked this question a couple of times.\n\nJust for fun, I thought I\u2019d answer it today.\n\nFirst, the question is vague \u2014 smoking what?\u2026 Cigarettes? Cigars? Pipes? Pot?\n\nAnd what kind of steroids?\u2026 Anabolic steroids, the kind bodybuilders and athletes take? \u2026 Or catabolic steroids, such as Prednisone?\n\nI\u2019ll assume he was referring to cigarettes and anabolic steroids.\n\nNow, the nicotine in cigarettes isn\u2019t nearly as bad as people think it is. It is addictive, that\u2019s for sure. But, cigarettes and the thousands of toxic and hyper-addictive chemicals they put in cigarettes are the REAL problems.\n\nNeedless to say, sure cigarettes are much worse for you than anabolic steroids.\n\nAre Steroids Any Better?\n\nAnabolic steroids are rarely linked to serious health problems, but cigarettes for sure are.\n\nAnabolic steroids can cause negative changes in cholesterol and blood pressure, but not nearly as bad as cigarettes.\n\nHowever, the correct anabolic steroids, dosage, and cycle can actually make you healthier and live longer. But, there is NO dose of cigarettes that will improve your health.\n\nKeep in mind that at the end of the day, steroids are just hormones.\n\nIn fact, \u201cthe pill\u201d, used by women as female contraceptives are also steroids.\n\nHell, vitamin D is a steroid.\n\nYou can take an entire bottle of anabolic steroids \u2013 Dianabol, Anavar, etc and you won\u2019t die. You\u2019ll get water retention, high blood pressure, mood changes, zits, and elevated liver enzymes for a few days. But, nothing else.\n\nHowever, if you take a bottle of aspirin, Tylenol, Advil, or other drugs, you will die or cause some long-term negative damage to your stomach and organs.\n\nAnyway, hormones are good for you, as long as they are balanced and in the correct, youthful range.\n\nWhat Should I Do Now?\n\nSince a guy posted this question, your goal is to have higher testosterone and free testosterone levels. Yet, you want lower \u201cnegative\u201d hormones such as estrogen and female hormones, DHT, and cortisol, and stress hormones.\n\nSteroids will help you accomplish this in the short term. However, getting off of them can be a nightmare and very psychologically addictive.\n\nI mean, who wants to get weaker, smaller, fatter, depressed, and lose their sex drive? This is what happens with steroids.\n\nThus, you want to improve your hormones naturally, so you don\u2019t have these negative side effects.\n\nNow you can discover a 20-year, proven formula that will help increase your anabolic hormones while decreasing the negative, catabolic hormones.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is about low testosterone, health problems, and early death.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation about this topic, so please read carefully\u2026\n\n\u201cDear Dr. Robbins \u2013 I haven\u2019t felt like myself for the past few years and things have only gotten worse. Especially when it comes to sexual performance. I watched one of your videos and decided to do a complete hormone blood test.\n\nWhen I got the results, it did show that my testosterone was in the \u201clow normal\u201d range. So, it\u2019s normal but lower end. I spoke to my doctor and he said that it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d this is just a part of aging and there\u2019s nothing I can or should do about it. And that increasing testosterone levels can cause prostate problems and it\u2019s bad for my heart.\n\nBut while I was driving home, I thought \u2013 how can this be? Young men have high testosterone and they don\u2019t have health or prostate problems. YET, older men have low testosterone and they are the ones with all the health issues.\n\nI\u2019m confused and I trust you. Please let me know the truth because I don\u2019t feel good and it\u2019s obviously causing negative problems with my wife and I don\u2019t feel very confident. But, I also don\u2019t want to damage my health.\u201d\n\nThanks for sharing and being honest.\n\nWomen are much better about expressing their insecurities and so forth, but guys typically just keep it to themselves and that\u2019s not good.\n\nSo, thank you and I hope this lets other men know that they\u2019re not alone.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Real Cause Of Prostate Problems?\n\nAs far as what your doctor said \u2013 sorry, this is totally false. It\u2019s an old-school mindset and erroneous point of view. Basically, he is wrong.\n\nTestosterone is not the cause of prostate problems. It\u2019s what testosterone converts to \u2013 which is Dihydrotestosterone (or DHT) and various estrogens, such as estradiol.\n\nAnd as DHT and Estradiol levels go up, testosterone comes down due to the conversion.\n\nSadly, the enzymes that make these conversions, such as 5-alpha reductase and aromatase, increase as we age.\n\nTherefore, as you get older, these enzymes increase, conversions to DHT and Estradiol increase, testosterone levels decrease and slowly but surely you:\n\nlose muscle mass and strength\n\nhave erectile problems\n\nlose that \u201cdrive\u201d in life\u2026\n\nIdeally, you would have testosterone in the normal HIGHER range, while having DHT and Estradiol in the normal LOWER ranges.\n\nThe problem with taking DHT and Estrogen lower drugs, such as Proscar, Propecia, Arimidex, and so forth \u2013 is they lower these two hormones TOO much and we also don\u2019t want that either.\n\nAnyway, this whole thing becomes a balancing act.\n\nRemember, there are no bad hormones. All the hormones are needed, but we just want healthy, youthful ratios that are optimized for health, fitness and longevity.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve stated in the past, you do NOT need drugs. You can and should improve your hormones naturally.\n\nLow Testosterone, Health Problems, and Early Death.\n\nThere are lots of studies showing how low testosterone can negatively affect the heart and brain.\n\nLow testosterone also causes muscle and strength loss, which is a huge indicator of longevity.\n\nThere was also a study showing that low testosterone led to a 60% increase in deaths in \u201call causes\u201d.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a bigger situation to take into consideration \u2013 not just LIFE span and how long you live.\n\nBut also your HEALTH span and how WELL you live.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I want to live an energetic, happy and confident life \u2026 where I look and feel good.\n\nWhere I perform well in and out of the bedroom.\n\nAnd trust me, low testosterone will do the opposite and THAT alone will cause early death, at least early emotional death!\n\nSo your goal at any age, especially after the age of 35 is to have a youthful hormonal balance. This takes into account various hormones \u2013 not just testosterone, but also DHT, female and stress hormones\u2026 In addition to peptide-related hormones such as insulin, GH, IGF and so forth.\n\nAs always, don\u2019t just passively listen to me, take action and improve your hormone levels.\n\nRemember, this situation will not magically fix itself and will only get worse as you age and have more stress in your life.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nHolmboe, et al. \u201cIndividual testosterone decline and future mortality risk in men.\u201d Eur J Endocrinol, 2018, Jan; 178(1): 123-130.\n\nPerheentupa, Anti, \u201cA Cohort Effect on Serum Testosterone Levels in Finnish Men.\u201d European Journal of Endocrinology 168(2), November 2012.\n\nO\u2019Donnell AB, Araujo AB, McKinlay JB. \u201cThe health of normally aging men: The Massachusetts Male Aging Study (1987-2004).\u201d Exp Gerontol. 2004 Jul;39(7):975-84.\n\nOskui, M. \u201cTestosterone and the Cardiovascular System: A Comprehensive Review of the Clinical Literature.\u201d JAHA, Nov. 15, 2013.\n\nWilson, Dr. Cameron. \u201cThe truth about low testosterone and \u2018male menopause.'\u201d The San Diego Union Tribune, Jan, 30th, 2014.",

    "content": "So almost every week, I get someone asking me about some testosterone-boosting, erectile-fixing herb or vitamin or pill or powder or whatever.\n\nI\u2019ve made so many articles about this topic and yet, the questions never end.\n\nAnd I think this is because there\u2019s just too much wrong information online that keeps being repeated by everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s like, follow the follower, not follow the LEADER!\n\nSo, allow me to lead you to the truth about boosting your testosterone levels \u2013 how it should be done correctly and why most people are doing it incorrectly. It is, unfortunately, causing more negative issues, and also they\u2019re just getting ripped off \u2014 which I hate!\n\nBenefits of Higher Testosterone\n\nBy now, I hope you know that when your testosterone levels are high:\n\nyou\u2019ll gain more muscle,\n\nyour mind will think better and more clearly,\n\nyou\u2019ll be much happier,\n\nand yes \u2014 your sex drive and libido will be higher, which means stronger, bigger, fuller erections!\n\nLow Testosterone = \u201cLess Money\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, starting in your mid-20s, your testosterone starts to go down. While negative hormones \u2014 such as:\n\nestrogen and other female hormones\n\nDHT \u2013 your hair loss hormones\n\nand stress hormones like cortisol\n\nTo use a money analogy, you\u2019re making LESS money and have MORE expenses.\n\nObviously, this is NOT what you want.\n\nNever Take ONE Ingredient\n\nSo now, guys want to increase their testosterone levels, great!\n\nThey ask me, \u201cdoes this herb work?\u201d \u2026 \u201chow much of this vitamin do I need?\u201d \u2026 \u201chow long before my testosterone goes up, permanently?\u201d and so on and so forth.\n\nListen, first and foremost, you should never take just ONE herb or vitamin to fix something.\n\nJust as you don\u2019t eat only ONE vegetable like broccoli all the time for good health, don\u2019t do the same for any herb. Whether it\u2019s maca or fenugreek or tribulus \u2026. or an amino like Arginine or Aspartic Acid \u2026 or a vitamin or mineral like Zinc or D or anything else.\n\nYour body will quickly adapt to just one ingredient, especially when it comes to hormones.\n\nThen you have to keep taking a higher and higher dosage to make things work, which means more side effects and money.\n\nWe don\u2019t want this, right?\n\nEventually, when you go off the one ingredient, which you have to do sooner or later, your body will crash, and your hormones will be completely unbalanced and even worse than when you first started.\n\nNow you feel like crap.\n\nThe Secret Is To Use Multiple Ingredients\n\nThe secret is to use multiple ingredients \u2014 at the correct dose and extract \u2014 each having its own set of specific benefits because they work differently.\n\nThis way you can use a lower dose, you\u2019ll get more benefits, and fewer side effects, and it\u2019ll work long before your body starts to adapt.\n\nThis is also why bodybuilders stack different steroids in a \u201ccycle\u201d.\n\nLower doses of 3 different drugs, will produce more positives and fewer negatives, than ONE drug at a higher dose.\n\nI hope this concept makes sense.\n\nThere\u2019s a point of \u201cdiminishing returns\u201d with any substance \u2013 food, drugs, herbs, and so forth.\n\nIncreasing Testosterone Can Be A Major Problem\n\nSecondly and MOST importantly, increasing your testosterone is a nice start \u2013 but that should NOT be your main goal.\n\nThe original problem is NOT the decrease in testosterone.\n\nThe main issue is the increase in the \u201cnegative\u201d, and \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones such as female hormones like estrogen and prolactin. As well as the hair loss hormone, DHT.\n\nAs these hormones go up due to stress and AGING, they will cause a negative feedback loop in your body to then DECREASE your testosterone levels.\n\nAgain, to use money as an example \u2014 you\u2019re making less profit because you have a lot more expenses.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nNegative \u201cConversions\u201d Due To Aging\n\nPlus, as you age, your body produces more negative enzymes, such as aromatase and 5-alpha reductase.\n\nThus, converting testosterone quickly to negative estrogen and DHT.\n\nThe end result is even LESS testosterone and more negative hormones.\n\nWhy You Get Fatter, Balding & Erection Problems\n\nThis Is why as you age and your testosterone decreases, you start to get fatter, get man-boobs, have a lower sex drive, start to get hairy in all the wrong places and lose head hair.\n\nThis negative conversion from testosterone to female and stress hormones is the real cause!\n\nSo by you taking any one of these testosterone-boosting herbs, WITHOUT blocking these conversions, will cause your testosterone to go up temporarily \u2014 but then come back down again after a couple of weeks.\n\nBut now, you have even MORE estrogen and DHT and even LOWER testosterone.\n\nYes, this got a little complicated.\n\nI have a simple solution for all of this at the end of the article. Go check it out after you finish this article.\n\nHere\u2019s What You Must Do\n\nSo your goal needs to be the following:\n\nIncrease your total testosterone \u2013 this is like your total revenue\n\nIncrease your FREE testosterone levels \u2013 this is like your profits\n\nDecrease negative hormones, such as estrogen, DHT, and stress hormones \u2014 these are like your expenses and bad employees in your business\n\nThe end result is higher testosterone, lower negative hormones, and you\u2019ll be able to maintain these positive, youthful levels for much longer, without side effects because your body won\u2019t quickly adapt.\n\nThis is how your body used to work as a teenager and in your early 20\u2019s, when you were healthy and happy.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get it to these youthful, healthy levels again \u2013 but naturally. No drugs, prescriptions, or injections.\n\nI know this got a bit complicated but read this article again to give you more clarity.\n\nAnd more importantly, click on this special link and you\u2019ll get more details and you can copy the same formula I\u2019ve been using since 1999, to optimize my testosterone levels, build more muscle, have better erections, and feel younger!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Let alone the negative side effects of\n\nerectile problems & shrinking testicles\n\ncardiac & cholesterol issues\n\nAnd initially, this is what a lot of my clients and professional athletes also used AlphaViril\u2122 for \u2014 better performance and that extra \u201cedge\u201d.\n\nHowever, as I got older I realized how important using AlphaViril\u2122 was for \u201canti-aging\u201d purposes.\n\nWhile my friends were looking older with more wrinkles, hair loss, fatter bellies, and smaller muscles\u2026\n\nI continue to maintain the same body weight and muscle mass year after year.\n\nOf course, I didn\u2019t lift as heavy weights anymore because my joints just couldn\u2019t take it and I didn\u2019t want to get injured.\n\nBut other than some gray hairs and some fine lines, I really haven\u2019t aged or changed much in the past decade or two.\n\nAnd I know for a fact having optimal, youthful testosterone levels is a prime reason!\n\nThis is because a man\u2019s testosterone begins to decline in his mid 20\u2019s.1\n\nThese days, due to the pollutants in our foods and water, all the electronics, and extra stress, men have much less testosterone than they did 50 or even 25 years ago.2\n\nBy age 40, most men are producing 12-23% less testosterone and it gets much worse in your 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s1,2\n\nSo if you\u2019re not feeling and looking the way you want to, it may not be your fault \u2013 it could be less testosterone.\n\nLifestyle Makes A Difference Also\n\nNow, another benefit I noticed is my \u201cdrive\u201d \u2014 both in life and in the bedroom, continues to be very high.\n\nSadly, as my friends have aged, they\u2019re always complaining about being tired, unmotivated, not as happy, and of course, \u201clowered libido\u201d and sex drive.\n\nA healthy lifestyle of nutritious foods, daily exercise, proper rest, and proven supplements is important.\n\nHowever, the way you look and feel is based primarily on your genetics and most importantly, the change in your hormones due to aging!\n\nAlphaViril helps deliver specific, scientifically researched ingredients that are proven to help optimize your \u201cyouth hormones\u201d while minimizing your \u201cnegative\u201d aging hormones.\n\nIt\u2019s the ONLY doctor-formulated solution that\u2019s designed to help:\n\nOptimize both total and \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels, which helps increase muscle mass, libido, and mood.\n\nDecrease excessive female hormones, such as estrogen and prolactin, which elevated levels increase body fat, cause depression, and decreased libido.\n\nBoost Nitric Oxide levels, which helps with blood flow\u2026 this is how drugs like Viagra work.\n\nMinimize \u201cstress\u201d hormones such as cortisol, which causes aging and belly fat.\n\nI wanted all the above benefits in ONE, simple and convenient pill and that\u2019s why I formulated AlphaViril.\n\nI\u2019m sure you already know, but the body works as a \u2018team\u2019, a well-oiled machine.\n\nYou can\u2019t only increase ONE hormone such as testosterone, or you\u2019ll have imbalances with your other hormones. I know this because my area of study is endocrinology \u2013 which is the \u201cstudy of hormones\u201d.\n\nSo your goal is to optimize your primary \u201cyouth\u201d hormones together by increasing the \u201cgood\u201d and decreasing the \u201cbad\u201d, so there is a synergy leading to maximum benefits AND safety.\n\nTHIS is what makes AlphaViril so much better than other solutions.\n\nWhy AlphaViril Is Better Than Other Solutions?\n\nIn fact, if AlphaViril is so effective that if it doesn\u2019t help improve your hormones, including your testosterone levels, in only 30 days, you\u2019ll get a FULL REFUND\u2026\n\nPLUS, an additional $100.00 cashback!\n\nNow, I can make such a powerful guarantee because AlphaViril\u2122 has\n\nOver 22+ years of proven track record that it works Utilizes natural ingredients that are validated with human, scientific studies. Backed with hundreds of customer reviews with REAL before & after blood tests for PROOF.\n\nOver 22+ years of proven track record that it works\n\nUtilizes natural ingredients that are validated with human, scientific studies.\n\nBacked with hundreds of customer reviews with REAL before & after blood tests for PROOF.\n\nAlphaViril\u2122 is manufactured in the US, in an FDA-approved facility. Utilizing organic herbal extracts, natural vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.\n\nFinally, AlphaViril\u2122 also comes with a YEAR satisfaction guarantee.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a man over the age of 30 and you want to optimize your testosterone and other \u201cyouth hormones\u201d for improved muscle mass, lowered body fat, and a healthy boost in your libido, then I suggest you give AlphaViril a try.\n\nIt\u2019s what I use. It\u2019s what I give to my friends and family.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2544367\n\nhttps://www.endocrine.org/news-room/press-release-archives/2006/testosterone_lvls_in_men_decline",

    "content": "Intermittent fasting has been a popular topic over the past few years.\n\nIf you are doing intermittent fasting and love it, look and feel great \u2013 then please continue to do it. There are many health benefits to fasting.\n\nBut if you are concerned about libido and testosterone levels, you should reconsider it.\n\nIntermittent Fasting And Hormones\n\nThere are studies showing how intermittent fasting does increase various hormones. However, a lot of this doesn\u2019t translate into real-world results as far as body composition.\n\nit\u2019s based on a very short time span.\n\ntestosterone has a short time rise, but long-term it was the opposite\n\ncortisol also shot up\n\nweight loss is mainly from eating LESS/fewer calories\n\nThere are also studies that also show a big drop in total & free testosterone levels in both men and women.\n\nThere tends to be an increase in stress hormones such as cortisol with long-term intermittent fasting.\n\nThere\u2019s also a drop in IGF-1 levels, which is a very powerful and anabolic hormone.\n\nIntermittent fasting people will say there\u2019s a big increase in GH levels. But, GH isn\u2019t nearly as important or as powerful as IGF-1 \u2013 it is more of a \u201cpre-cursor\u201d hormone. The important and true value of GH is the ability for it to convert to IGF-1.\n\nAnd for that to happen, you need optimal thyroid, insulin, and testosterone levels \u2013 all of which tend to drop with long-term intermittent fasting.\n\nThe truth is that the higher GH response is due to higher stress and cortisol production.\n\nWhat Happens In Real-Life?\n\nI\u2019ve seen lots of blood tests over the years of intermittent fasters, that clearly show a significant drop in these powerful youth hormones. And the longer the fast, the bigger the problem.\n\nThese people also start to lose muscle mass and gain body fat, even if they lost body weight. They start to look skinny-fat.\n\nRemember, losing body WEIGHT is different than body FAT.\n\nBased on all the years of feedback from people who do intermittent fasting\u2026 young and old, male and female\u2026 I\u2019ve realized that long-term intermittent fasting tends to have a negative effect on youthful hormones \u2013 such as testosterone and IGF-1 levels.\n\nOver time, it can also cause a negative change in body composition.\n\nAnd this all has to do with negative changes in your hormones over the long term.\n\nIf your goal is gaining muscle weight, and losing body fat\u2026 And to have a higher sex drive and libido, you might reconsider doing intermittent fasting.\n\nAt the very least, take testosterone-boosting and cortisol-reducing vitamins.\n\nMake sure you continue to lift weights.\n\nAnd try to eat your meals and calories around your workouts \u2013 thus, before and after. This will at least feed the nutrients towards muscle growth when they need it the most.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "These days, I get a lot of questions about erectile dysfunction (ED) and impotence. It\u2019s become a lot more common now, than a few decades ago because of multiple reasons.\n\nThe first is hormonal imbalances and lower testosterone levels because of\n\nHigher stress and faster pace lifestyle\n\nLack of key nutrients due to poor food production \u2013 pesticides, hormones in meats, etc.\n\nLow physical activity and higher body fats\n\nHormonal imbalances due to the environment and aging, cause physical symptoms of erectile problems, in addition to \u201cemotional\u201d problems with lowered sex drive, libido, and the DESIRE to have sex.\n\nRemember, hormones affect you both physically and emotionally.\n\nHowever, men who have ED, have a normal sex drive and \u201cdesire\u201d, but simply can\u2019t get an erection or have difficulty maintaining it during sex.\n\nAnd in these situations, this tends to be more of a VASCULAR problem due to poor blood flow and circulation.\n\nWhat Is the Primary Cause Of ED?\n\nRemember, in order to achieve an erection, three conditions must occur:\n\nthe nerves in the penis must be functioning properly\n\nthe blood circulation to the penis must be adequate\n\nthere must be a stimulus from the brain\n\nIf there is something interfering with any or all of these conditions, a full erection will be prevented.\n\n#1 Health Problem That Causes ED\n\nThere are different diseases that can cause erectile dysfunction. However, today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss the #1 causing health problem, which accounts for over 70% of physical-related causes of ED and that\u2019s a vascular!1,2\n\nSimply stated, vascular diseases affect your blood vessels and restrict blood flow to your heart, brain, and in the case of ED \u2014 your penis.\n\nIn fact, more specifically, atherosclerosis, which is the hardening of your arteries, accounts for almost 60% of ED cases in men over the age of 55! 1,3\n\nErectile Dysfunction \u2013 A Sign Of Heart Problem?\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that the newest research shows that men with ED typically also have heart problems.5 Thus, ED is a pre-warning sign that you may have heart problems in the future because you have a buildup of plaque and calcium in your blood vessels.5\n\nHow To Support Healthy Blood Flow\n\nThe older we get, the worse our circulation becomes. This affects your entire body \u2013 from head to your two, inside and out. Remember, your blood contains oxygen, youthful hormones, and nutrients to feed all of your cells.\n\nSo you must have healthy circulation for better health and longevity and this first starts with improving your lifestyle. This means:\n\nReduce or eliminate fried fats. Eat natural, raw fats \u2013 raw nuts and seeds, avocados, extra virgin olive oil, fish oils, and similar uncooked fats.\n\nChoose wild-caught fish and cage-free poultry more often than red meat.\n\nEliminate dairy, sugars, and caffeine.\n\nEat more soluble fiber. Good sources are fruits, beans, peas, oats, and fiber supplements.\n\nManage stress and get more rest.\n\nThese are the basics and I\u2019m sure you already know most of these suggestions. Lifestyle improvements take time to see the benefits, so please be patient!\n\nHowever, you have to make the changes, or else things will only get worse.\n\nFaster Results, With Less Effort\n\nYour next option if you want faster results with less effort, is to take specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals that are clinically proven to help support healthy blood flow and circulation. While also strengthens your vascular system and makes your blood vessels and arteries more flexible, to help prevent heart problems.\n\nThis all translates to a healthy heart, mind, and of course, better, harder and stronger erections.\n\nHowever, important supplements you should take specifically for healthy blood flow are:\n\nVit C, D3, E, and K2-7. In addition to a good magnesium blend with calcium.\n\nAmino Acids: N-Acetyl L-Cysteine and a specific Carnitine blend.\n\nExtracts: Ginger, Green Tea, White Willow, and Nattokinase\n\nThe above combination works wonders and this is exactly what I\u2019ve used with my own father for healthy blood flow after he had a stroke. And he saw and felt results in less than 30 days.\n\nIf you want to finally fix your ED problems and dramatically improve your sex drive, make sure you improve your hormones and don\u2019t forget to ALSO support healthy blood flow.\n\nYour heart, mind, AND penis will thank you!\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nThomson IM, Tangen CM, Goodman PJ, et al.

But, I also have super high testosterone levels\u2026\u201d I\u2019ll discuss in a minute, how I keep my testosterone so high\u2026 so keep reading.\n\nNeedless to say, I decided to dig deeper.\n\nSo in one clinical study, it showed there was a decrease in testosterone levels when used daily after 2 months of use. It also lowered fertility. But, this was done on rats and if you read the entire clinical study in detail, the dosage was crazy high.\n\nSo, this doesn\u2019t pertain to you or me.\n\nIn another clinical study, it showed a decrease in ejaculation and how often sexual behavior is initiated. Thus, a lowered sex drive. However, when digging deeper into the study, there was no significant decrease in testosterone levels.\n\nAgain, this study was done on rats, at a very high dose and it was also done on diabetic rats.\n\nEither way, this doesn\u2019t pertain to you or me.\n\nI also found other blog articles saying that stevia lowered testosterone. But it was written by \u201cless educated people\u201d who don\u2019t fully understand how the endocrine system works and made idiotic assumptions.\n\nBUT, the story doesn\u2019t end here. So keep reading.\n\nSince I\u2019m naturally curious, I kept researching any potential \u201cEndocrine Disruptors\u201d associated with Stevia.\n\nThus, anything that can cause hormonal imbalance.\n\nAnd well, I found that certain isolated forms of steviol, one of the compounds in stevia, can increase progesterone levels. This being a female hormone, can indirectly lower testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, again\u2026 the dose needs to be fairly high. And, it was just one study.\n\nSo, after all that \u2013 what\u2019s the bottom line?\n\nTaking stevia can potentially lower testosterone levels and act as an endocrine \u201chormone\u201d disruptor.\n\nHowever, the dosage needs to be fairly high \u2026 around 40-50 packets a day or more.\n\nStevia does have other issues that I didn\u2019t mention today.\n\nHowever, my advice is to go ahead and get organic stevia, enjoy it, but like everything, limit it to small amounts. Like 5 packets or less a day \u2013 which is a lot anyway.\n\nIf you need more than that, then you\u2019ve got a big-time sweet tooth that needs to be addressed\u2026 which I will do in a future article \u2013 how to reduce and eliminate sugar cravings. Let me know if this topic interests you by sending me a message.\n\nHowever, even if stevia doesn\u2019t lower your testosterone levels, there are dozens of things that do \u2013 aging being a big factor.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to my favorite, natural solution for improving your testosterone levels, while reducing negative anti-testosterone hormones such as female and stress hormones.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "2025 | Does Ashwagandha Increase Testosterone & Libido? Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/does-ashwagandha-increase-testosterone-libido-warnings-benefits/",
    "content": "I get a lot of questions about Ashwagandha. So, today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss:\n\nWhat ashwagandha is and how it works\n\nBenefits and side effects\n\nDoes it really work for increasing testosterone\n\nWhat\u2019s the correct form and dosage\n\nHow to make it work better and safer.\n\nAshwagandha is an adaptogenic herb.\n\nAn adaptogen is defined as \u201ca nontoxic substance, typically a plant extract, that increases the body\u2019s ability to resist the damaging effects of stress and promotes or restores normal physiological functioning\u201d\n\nFor example, Ginseng is another well-known adaptogen.\n\nSimply stated, adaptogens create better balance in the body.\n\nWhy Does Someone Use Ashwagandha?\n\nWhen it comes to Ashwagandha, it\u2019s usually utilized for two main reasons:\n\nImproving testosterone levels and all the potential benefits that come with that \u2013 such as higher libido and sex drive, muscle mass, strength, fat loss\u2026\n\nDecreasing stress hormones such as cortisol and all the benefits that come with that \u2013 better mood, sleep, fat loss, less anxiety, improved overall health\u2026\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to focus on the former, which is testosterone \u2013 does ashwagandha really improve testosterone levels, and what are the potential negative effects and warnings?\n\nDoes Ashwagandha Really Increase Testosterone?\n\nThere have been a few good clinical studies about Ashwagandha.\n\nThere is one study that showed a 15% increase in testosterone in healthy men who lifted weights.\n\nAnother study with regular men aged 40-70, also showed an increase in testosterone by about 15%\n\nA different study showed improvements in muscle strength, size, and recovery from the increase in testosterone.\n\nAnother study showed a 5x high level of testosterone than the placebo. Which doesn\u2019t seem realistic to me.\n\nOther studies show an increase in testosterone levels by as little as 10% to as high as 40%.\n\nIn addition to the testosterone-raising benefits, there are also a lot of studies about infertility and how ashwagandha can help improve sperm count, motility, and quality.\n\nAnd what about erectile problems \u2013 does ashwagandha help with this? Well, studies have given mixed results \u2013 some yes, some no difference.\n\nBut if you mix Ashwagandha with other herbs (see below), then there is for sure a dramatic improvement in better, harder and fuller erections\n\nCorrect Form & Dosage\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve noticed mixed results with Ashwagandha \u2013 both clinically and empirically (in the real world).\n\nSelecting the correct form (see below) will make a huge difference if the product works or not.\n\nFirst off, forget about taking liquid forms. They are never as potent and can go bad quickly.\n\nNever take the \u201croot powder\u201d. It\u2019s a dead powder with no active ingredients.\n\nIt always has to be the extract, which is where are all the benefits are. So, please read the labels.\n\nWhat you want is a high extract dose. Ideally, it would be something high, such as 32% oligosaccharides and 10% withanolide extract.\n\nThe higher the extract percentage, the higher the active ingredients, potency, and positive effects.\n\nAlso, there are two clinically proven versions of Ashwagandha that have dozens of human trials proving the potency, form, and positive benefits.\n\nThe two best ones are KSM-66\u00ae + Sensoril\u00ae \u2013 They\u2019re patented and these are the two I use personally. I mix them together to ensure I get the best of both.\n\nAs far as the dose, studies show the ideal amount would be between 125-600 mg daily of the extract. Remember, the higher the extract, the lower the dose you need.\n\nIf it\u2019s 10% extract, 125-250 mg daily is fine. If it\u2019s 2.5% extract, you\u2019ll need 800 mg daily. You\u2019re paying for the active ingredient.\n\nThis is why I use both KSM-66\u00ae + Sensoril\u00ae \u2013 they have the highest extract percentage, which means I need a lower dose to get more benefits.\n\nHow To Make Ashwagandha Work Better\n\nUtilizing Ashwagandha extract to boost testosterone levels is a good start.\n\nHowever, it should never be the only one ingredient.\n\nHormones are complicated. Your body will quickly adapt if you only use 1 ingredient.\n\nThere are other mechanisms and ways to improve both total and free testosterone levels. You also want to optimize other hormones such as estrogen and DHT.\n\nSo if you want to maximize your testosterone levels, it\u2019s best to use Ashwagandha with other testosterone-boosting, hormone-balancing herbs such as\n\nTestofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract\n\nAnd a few other herbs and minerals.\n\nOf course, this can get expensive and inconvenient if you have to buy a dozen different products.\n\nThis is why I\u2019ve been using AlphaViril for over 22+ years \u2013 because it contains all of the best testosterone-boosting herbs, in addition to the two best forms of ashwagandha extract \u2013 KSM-66\u00ae + Sensoril\u00ae\n\nThe two main reasons to use ashwagandha are for boosting testosterone levels and sperm product \u2026 or to lower stress and cortisol levels.\n\nIn clinical studies, ashwagandha has been shown to increase testosterone levels by 10-40%\n\nThe ideal dose is 125-500 mg daily. Select one with a high extract percentage.\n\nThe two best versions that are clinically proven and patented are KSM-66\u00ae + Sensoril\u00ae\n\nUtilize ashwagandha with other testosterone-boosting, hormone-balancing ingredients to dramatically increase the positive benefits & safety.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "WARNING: How Stimulants & Stress Affect Testosterone & Hormones | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/warning-how-stimulants-stress-affect-testosterone-hormones/",
    "content": "A little while ago I made a video entitled, \u201cThe Truth About Exercise: Does It Increase or Decrease Testosterone Levels?\u201d\n\nI highly suggest you watch that video if you exercise \u2013 whether it\u2019s with weights and/or cardio.\n\nNow, an important question that was asked from that article was:\n\n\u201cI take pre-workout stimulants; how do those products affect my testosterone levels? I\u2019m stronger at the gym because of it, does that mean it\u2019s increasing my testosterone levels? What about adrenaline, is it good or bad?\u201d\n\nSo, this is a great question because I know a lot of people take \u201cpre-workout stimulants\u201d or basically, different products that\u2019ll give them more energy, such as \u201cenergy drinks\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, almost all of these products are just loaded with caffeine. Sure, they\u2019ll have some vitamins and amino acids, but it\u2019s all about the caffeine. That\u2019s the primary ingredient that\u2019s doing it all, that\u2019s causing the \u201cstimulation\u201d of your adrenal glands to produce more adrenaline and epinephrine.\n\nSpeaking of epinephrine, in the old days we used to take ephedrine, which is basically an amphetamine.\n\nSo, when taking such stimulants (pre-workout pills and energy drinks), your body produces more adrenaline/epinephrine, which triggers your body\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d response. This causes your air passages to dilate and open up more, which provides your muscles with more \u201cenergy\u201d and oxygen.\n\nObviously, this is great for exercise.\n\nAt the same time, adrenaline causes your blood vessels to get smaller and contract, to redirect more blood towards your muscles \u2013 including your heart and lungs. This is one reason your heart rate speeds up and your blood pressure goes up with stimulants.\n\nThe end result is you\u2019ll feel less pain \u2013 so you can push longer and harder, which is perfect when you\u2019re exercising or if you\u2019re trying to run for your life.\n\nYou\u2019ll also become stronger and have heightened awareness. Again, all great for exercise.\n\nUnfortunately, your body\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d response is NOT to be triggered daily. This is massive stress on the body. This causes a huge increase in stress hormones, such as cortisol.\n\nNow, keep in mind that exercise, in itself, will cause an increase in adrenaline and cortisol. These stimulant products are now ADDING to this stress. This is EXTRA stress. So now, that\u2019s double the stress on your body and endocrine system (hormones).\n\nHowever, that\u2019s just the beginning of the negativity.\n\nThese days, most people already have adrenal fatigue due to an overproduction of adrenaline.\n\nOur lives are very complicated now, compared to 100+ years ago.\n\nWe are getting bombarded with \u201cstuff\u201d all day long and being pulled in different directions, all the time, which is very stressful.\n\nThis is why we feel overwhelmed and unmotivated.\n\nYour phone alone is a massive \u201cstressor\u201d.\n\nDriving and all that goes along with it \u2013 is another massive stressor.\n\nWe have more responsibilities and information coming at us, ALL day long. From first thing in the morning, all the way till bedtime.\n\nWe work more and longer hours and yet, we are sleeping LESS and less deeply. Thus, your nervous and adrenal system does NOT have time to recover properly and fully.\n\nPeople don\u2019t even realize this because we are just now \u201cused\u201d this. We just tolerate it.\n\nSo, What Does All This Mean?\u2026\n\nMost people have elevated levels of stress hormones.\n\nSome have it so bad that it has just burnt out their adrenal glands and thus, they need stimulants such as caffeine and coffee just to feel \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cget through the day\u201d.\n\nAll of this now causes a massive hormonal imbalance and thus, more stress hormones, such as cortisol, end up causing a decrease in both total and free testosterone levels.\n\nRemember, the opposite of testosterone is NOT the female hormone estrogen, but the stress hormone \u2013 cortisol!\n\nProlonged stress also causes negative changes in other key hormones such as insulin, Growth Hormones, IGF, Prolactin, Thyroid, and so forth.\n\nAll of these will cause NEGATIVE changes in how you look and feel. This means less muscle and more fat.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have less motivation and drive, including in the bedroom, and thus, lowered libido, and erectile problems for guys.\n\nThe bottom line here is that you want to manage stress levels and NOT add to them. Taking pre-workout stimulants, energy drinks, and other products that have caffeine and similar compounds, ADDS to an already stressed body.\n\nYes, you\u2019ll feel a short-term increase in performance, but the price will be a DECREASE in long-term results.\n\nRemember, you want to lower stress levels \u2013 NOT add to them.\n\nIf any of today\u2019s articles make sense to you\u2026 if you\u2019re tired or you need caffeine products to just feel normal or to have a good workout\u2026 if you feel like your testosterone levels aren\u2019t where they should be\u2026 if you\u2019re not as motivated or happy or excited about life, then one potential cause is \u201coverstress\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s time you heal your body and I have two links for you.\n\nOne is about improving your testosterone and hormone levels, so you can build more muscle, lose fat and have a better sex drive.\n\nThe second is about improving your energy levels, memory, and cognition, WITHOUT the use of stimulants, such as caffeine. You\u2019ll help repair adrenal fatigue.\n\nTake a look at either one or both links, based on what you want and need.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

As testosterone drops, you typically will become more estrogen dominant and thus, more \u201cfemale\u201d and well, that\u2019ll kill your drive even more.\n\nSugar Lowers GH Growth hormone has many health benefits, including higher libido. High blood sugar and insulin resistance lower GH, which also lowers testosterone and thus, the same problem again.\n\nSugar Lowers Leptin Leptin is a hormone that tells your brain to stop eating and that you\u2019re full. Unfortunately, eating a lot of sugar, processed foods, flour, and so forth, decreases leptin and also causes leptin resistance. So, you end up eating more and more food over time. However, Leptin also contributes to sexual behavior and desire.\n\nSugar Decreases Orexin Orexin is a neurotransmitter that regulates eating behavior, wakefulness, and yes, arousal. On a side note, too much sugar also causes dopamine resistance, another neurotransmitter that controls sex drive.\n\nSugar Increases Cortisol Cortisol is your stress hormone. Carbohydrates actually help lower cortisol levels. However, too many carbs, high blood sugar, and insulin resistance eventually increase cortisol. And as cortisol goes up, testosterone comes down and yup, there goes your libido and ability to get erections.\n\nGenetics and aging of course play a part in all of this. However, you MUST improve your diet and lifestyle, so you can have healthy blood sugar levels and optimal insulin resistance, which will help improve your hormones and improve your ability to get erections.\n\nThere is a simple and natural way to do this, it will only take a few minutes and produce fast results.\n\nTake a look right now while it\u2019s fresh on your mind.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22804876\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10484056\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9302400\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099463",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/bigger-harder-fuller-erections-best-amino-acid/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019ve got some really interesting facts about having bigger, harder and fuller erections\u2026 and as a side benefit, a healthy heart, blood flow, and blood pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s so powerful that today\u2019s topic has won a Nobel Prize and it\u2019s also connected to one of the most popular drugs ever made.\n\nNitric Oxide \u2013 \u2018Molecule of the Year\u201d\n\nSo today\u2019s topic is about increasing Nitric Oxide levels, which has the chemical formula of, \u201cNO\u201d.\n\nIt was first discovered in 1772, but was thought to be an \u201catmospheric pollutant\u201d. Thus, a waste of time.\n\nHowever, 220 years later in 1992, Nitric Oxide (NO) was named, \u201cMolecule of the Year\u201d.\n\nNow, Nitric Oxide has lots of benefits, but the 3 most important and popular ones are:\n\nSupporting healthy blood pressure\n\nBoosting exercise performance because of better vasodilation and blood flow to the muscles.\n\nAnd the one we guys care about the most \u2026 Improving erections and treating erectile dysfunction, by again \u2013 improving blood flow to the penis.\n\nOne Of The Most Popular Drugs In The World\n\nSo, remember how in 1992, \u201cNO\u201d was named \u201cMolecule of the Year\u201d?\u2026\n\nWell, that SAME year in 1992, the Pharmaceutical company Pfizer filed a patent for sildenafil and its use to treat cardiovascular diseases \u2026 because of its blood pressure improving abilities.\n\nThe name of this drug is called Revatio.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that 2 years later, in 1994, Pfizer filed a SECOND patent covering the use of the SAME drug, sildenafil\u2026 to treat erectile dysfunction.\n\nThe name of this drug is Viagra.\n\nSAME exact drug. TWO different names. The ONLY difference is the price.\n\nRevatio sells for about 0.50 to $1 a pill depending on the source.\n\nWhile Viagra sells for about $10 to $25 to as much as $50 a pill over the years, before the generics.\n\nAs you can see, a total rip off and sadly, 99% of physicians don\u2019t know this and they prescribe the more expensive Viagra.\n\nSo, putting aside the pricing BS, Sildenafil is a PDE5 inhibitor, which to make a long story short, works by vasodilation and improving blood flow to the penis by enhancing Nitric Oxide (NO) levels.\n\nThis is also how Cialis works, but that\u2019s just long-acting, while Viagra is short-acting.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ve simplified all of this, but the main thing to focus on is that Nitric Oxide needs to be improved for better health and erections.\n\nIncreasing Nitric Oxide Naturally\n\nSo, how do we improve Nitric Oxide levels naturally, without having to take expensive drugs and deal with the side effects?\n\nWell, an amino acid called L-Arginine helps increase Nitric Oxide levels through the \u201cL-arginine-NO pathway\u201d\n\nAnd when taken at the correct dose, it of course helps with blood pressure and erections.\n\nThere are also different and more improved forms, such as AAKG (L-Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate). More powerful at a lower dose.\n\nArginine or Citrulline?\n\nNow, what\u2019s interesting is that when L-arginine is converted to nitric oxide, another amino acid called L-citrulline is produced as a byproduct.\n\nL-citrulline can then be recycled back to L-arginine and used to increase your body\u2019s natural production of nitric oxide.\n\nIn fact, L-citrulline may increase levels of L-arginine in your body more than supplementing with L-arginine itself does. This is because a large percentage of L-arginine is broken down before reaching your bloodstream.\n\nHence, why using AAKG is a better option than regular L-arginine.\n\nOf course, L-citrulline has similar benefits of healthier blood pressure and erections.\n\nOver the years, L-citrulline has actually become a better option than L-arginine.\n\nHere\u2019s A Better Combo\n\nHowever, things get really interesting because there are several human clinical studies that have shown the combination of:\n\nFrench maritime Pine Bark Extract (Pinus massoniana) [97% Proanthocyanidins]\n\n\u2026 To \u201cSignificantly improve sexual function in men with ED\u201d \u2014 far more than taking either of these supplements individually, by themselves.\n\nThis is why I included this trio, the \u201cthree musketeers\u201d in AlphaViril.\n\nL-Arginine in the form of AAKG (L-Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate)\u2026 plus L-Citrulline + Pine Bark Extract at 97% Proanthocyanidins\n\nNow you know why AlphaViril has been one of the best-selling supplements in the world for over 20 years.\n\nYou Need Testosterone\n\nOne last thing to keep in mind about Nitric Oxide and erections \u2013 it only helps with improving blood flow. It does nothing for stimulating an erection or creating that emotional desire.\n\nAnd the lower your testosterone, the less effective these NO stimulators are \u2013 this includes drugs like Viagra or Cialis.\n\nThe irony is that older man who has the most difficulty getting an erection, NO stimulating supplements, and drugs such as Viagra and Cialis work the LEAST because they have lower testosterone levels.\n\nYET, these substances work the best in younger men, who don\u2019t need it, but because they have better testosterone levels \u2013 things are all working better, it\u2019s more effective and a lower dose is needed.\n\nAnd if you didn\u2019t know, testosterone also directly improves NO levels. So, simply increasing testosterone levels will improve erections because of better Nitric Oxide signaling without the use of NO stimulating substances.\n\nAlphaViril \u2013 The \u201cAll-In-One\u201d Solution\n\nAgain, the human body and hormones are complicated \u2013 especially that damn penis which seems to have a mind of its own.\n\nAs an endocrinology, and hormone doctor \u2013 I designed AlphaViril originally for myself over 20+ years ago, to deal with all of these factors in addition to others \u2013 such as decreasing excessive female hormones and improving dopamine.\n\nAlphaViril is the best, \u201call-in-one\u201d solution that comes with a one-year guarantee. In fact, results in 30 days or you\u2019ll receive a full refund + an additional $100.00 cashback\n\nYES, a crazy guarantee only because I have over 20+ years of proof \u2026\n\nSo while it\u2019s fresh on your mind, do something now and get this part of your life fixed because the older you get, the worse the problems and harder to fix.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "To my surprise \u2013 it\u2019s been shown that social media can cause the lowering of testosterone levels.\n\nLet Me Give You The Bottom Line\n\nWhen you win, especially men, your testosterone levels go up.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/taking-testosterone-injections-vs-testosterone-boosting-supplements/",
    "content": "Today I want to talk about a question I get asked often. I\u2019m a bit surprised mainly because I didn\u2019t think there was so much confusion about it.\n\nThe topic is increasing your testosterone levels \u201cexogenously\u201d, which means from the OUTSIDE, artificially \u2013 such as with testosterone injects, creams, or pills.\n\nIncreasing your testosterone \u201cendogenously,\u201d which means from WITHIN, naturally \u2013 such as with supplements, herbs, vitamins, and so forth.\n\nAnd I bring this up because Salvadore asked the following question:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam, I\u2019ve been using the testosterone boosting herbal supplement AlphaViril for almost 9 months now and things are going well. My libido and sex drive is high all the time (which my wife loves!), I\u2019ve gained muscle and strength, my body fat is lower (lost 2 inches around my waist =)) and I\u2019m just generally happier and more positive. All good stuff\u2026\n\nHowever, my wife is now telling me that this is the same as taking steroids, like testosterone injections. Like what bodybuilders take. She says this isn\u2019t natural. I don\u2019t agree, but she\u2019s worried. Can you please make a video about this, so I can put this topic to rest?\u201d\n\nSo the short answer to your question is that NO, taking AlphaViril or other testosterone-boosting supplements is NOT at all like taking testosterone injections or \u201csteroids.\u201d\n\nMost Supplements Don\u2019t Work\n\nFirst, most of these supplements don\u2019t work anyway. AlphaViril works because it\u2019s clinically proven and the focus isn\u2019t \u201conly\u201d on increasing testosterone. It ALSO works by \u201cdecreasing\u201d negative hormones such as female (estrogen, prolactin) and stress hormones (cortisol).\n\nThis doubles and triples the benefits, without any negatives.\n\nI\u2019ll get to the importance of this in a minute because it\u2019s very valuable and it is why you have gotten positive results.\n\nTestosterone Injections, Pills, and Creams\n\nTaking testosterone \u2013 whether it\u2019s with injections, creams, or pills, is far more powerful. You can keep taking more and more, higher and higher dosages and continue to see more and more effects \u2014 both positive AND negative.\n\nIn fact, this is why bodybuilders are bigger, more muscular, and leaner \u2013 lots of testosterone and other steroids derived from testosterone.\n\nHowever, with it also comes a lot more negative side effects:\n\nMoodiness (happy, sad, anxiety, etc.)\n\n\u201cMan Boobs\u201d (Gynecomastia)whe\n\nHigher cholesterol and blood pressure\n\nIn order to reduce these negatives, you ALSO need to take \u201cinhibiting\u201d drugs to reduce estrogen, prolactin, DHT, HCG, and other hormones. It can get very complicated.\n\nPlus, once you start, you can\u2019t stop because taking testosterone will SHUT down your own production, and thus, your testicles shrink and sometimes just disappear into little raisins.\n\nAnyway, the point is that with more \u201cgrowth\u201d (muscle, strength, lower body fat), ALSO comes more side effects. Especially if you\u2019re over the age of 35. The older we get, the more sensitive we become to side effects.\n\nHow Natural Supplements Work\n\nHowever, if you get a natural supplement that actually works, such as AlphaViril, all it\u2019s doing is MAXIMIZING and OPTIMIZING your own testosterone levels. Naturally\u2026 from within.\n\nBecause of this, there\u2019s a limit.\n\nIt\u2019ll take it to the highest NATURAL levels for your body \u2013 like when you were young. Actually, it\u2019ll make it a little higher, but still in a safe and healthy range.\n\nAnd the other benefit of AlphaViril is that it also has natural \u201cinhibitors\u201d, which will reduce \u201cnegative\u201d hormones (female, stress, etc.) and this will further improve the results and optimize your testosterone.\n\nNow you won\u2019t have the negative side effects. It actually HELPS your prostate. It can INCREASE your testicular size. You won\u2019t get acne, hair loss, and so forth.\n\nHowever, you also will NOT gain 30-50 lbs of muscle like you do with artificial testosterone and other steroids.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nI have nothing against taking testosterone shots IF you have a good doctor who understands all the complicated hormones and knows how to balance them out. And only AFTER you\u2019ve tried the natural methods and thus, the injections are your last hope.\n\nBecause like I said, once you start taking testosterone shots, you can\u2019t stop!\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nIf you want to become a pro bodybuilder, you\u2019ll need to take lots of testosterone and other steroids. You\u2019ll never get the same results with AlphaViril.\n\nHowever, If you want to make improvements in your health, how you look and feel, gain muscle, lose fat, and increase your libido, then optimize your testosterone levels and balance out your hormones, naturally.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is for any guy who wants bigger muscles, less belly fat, a higher sex drive and libido, fuller, harder and bigger erections, more energy, a happier mood, and basically a lot more confidence.\n\nAnd with that said, today I want to discuss AlphaViril and how you can benefit from utilizing this over 20-year proven formula to naturally, quickly, and easily achieve the goals that I just mentioned.\n\nAlphaViril is a natural remedy that helps dramatically improve balance and optimize your hormone levels\u2013 more specifically improve your youthful positive hormones such as total and free testosterone levels, LH, and FSH, while also decreasing your negative aging hormones such as estrogen and prolactin, DHT, as well as stress hormones such as cortisol.\n\nAlphaViril contains organic non-GMO ingredients \u2013 all based on human clinical studies, at the correct science-backed dosages.\n\nIt\u2019s manufactured in the US in an FDA-approved facility.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that AlphaViril is the only product that has all these hormone-optimizing benefits and just ONE PILL and I\u2019ll tell you exactly how it works in a minute including the proven benefits you\u2019ll see and feel when you utilize AlphaViril.\n\nAlphaViril is so effective that it comes with a one-year satisfaction guarantee. In fact, it\u2019s so potent that if it doesn\u2019t help improve your testosterone levels and balance and optimize your hormones in just 30 days you get a full refund plus an additional $100 cash back on top of it.\n\nI can make such a powerful guarantee because I have over 20 years of proof that AlphaViril works. I have clinical evidence and human studies backing everything up and hundreds of positive reviews from users around the world including real before and after hormone blood tests for additional proof.\n\nI originally created AlphaViril for myself around the time I turned 30 years old.\n\nBasically, I noticed I was starting to lose some strength and muscle when I was going to the gym and I\u2019m starting to put on some belly fat, and lower energy\u2026 I just wasn\u2019t as happy or driven as I used to be in my 20s and worst of all, my libido and sex drive were starting to get lower.\n\nSimply stated, I was starting to kind of look and feel old so I knew I had to take action so as soon as possible\n\nObviously, I didn\u2019t want to take unnatural, harmful, and addictive drugs that required me to use the rest of my life.\n\nI wanted to naturally and safely improve my hormones, to their optimal youthful levels in my late teens and early 20s.\n\nI wanted a healthy solution that worked WITH my body to fix my hormones, and NOT against it \u2026 as drugs do. And this is why I created AlphaViril.\n\nAlphaViril contains non-GMO, organic herbs, vitamins, and amino acids\u2026 all in ONE, a convenient vegetarian pill you take daily.\n\nNow, what makes AlphaViril so effective and better than other supplements is that I wanted an ALL-IN-ONE solution.\n\nI got tired of wasting time and money, mixing and matching different products, herbs and vitamins because no ONE single solution existed and still doesn\u2019t, except for AlphaViril.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because I\u2019m the only hormone doctor that actually formulates my own products. I wanted 5 or 6 products in 1, so it\u2019s easy, convenient, and works quickly.\n\nAnd of course, it\u2019ll save me money!\n\nSimply stated, I wanted a TOTAL hormone-optimizing solution for us guys.\n\nHow AlphaViril Works?\n\nAlphaViril works through 6 specific, clinically proven pathways.\n\nIncreases \u201cpositive\u201d hormones, total and free testosterone levels, LH, and FSH\u2026 which means more muscle and strength, less belly fat, and higher libido and sex drive. Also, better sperm production and mobility.\n\nIt decreases excess levels of \u201cnegative\u201d hormones, such as\n\nfemale hormones, estrogen, and prolactin\u2026 causing man boobs, body fat, and moodiness.\n\nDHT (dihydrotestosterone)\u2026 causes balding, excess body hair, and prostate problems.\n\nStress hormones such as cortisol\u2026 cause belly fat, muscle loss, and accelerated aging.\n\nHowever, in addition to optimizing your hormones, AlphaViril also:\n\nIncreases nitric oxide levels, causing bigger, fuller, harder, and prolonged erections.\n\nFinally, it helps increase the neurotransmitter dopamine\u2026 which increases emotional drive, excitement, and happiness.\n\nNow you know why AlphaViril is so effective.\n\nAlmost all products deal with only ONE solution \u2013 typically increasing testosterone levels. But, that\u2019s just the beginning.\n\nRemember, as negative \u201caging\u201d hormones go up, positive \u201cyouthful\u201d hormones like testosterone come down.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Better Than Other Solutions?\n\nThis means you and I would have to buy multiple products to get all the benefits you get in ONE pill of AlphaViril. Obviously, that gets expensive and inconvenient.\n\nWith AlphaViril, you have a COMPLETE, \u201c5-in-1\u201d formula, saving you TIME & MONEY!\u2026 It\u2019s a natural, safe, and long-term solution delivering fast results.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to take my word for it.\n\nLook into the specific details and benefits. View the ingredients and how they work. Clinical studies and scientific research.\n\nAnd the hundreds of reviews, including the before and after blood tests for PROOF.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "The truth is, everyone enjoys a robust and youthful sex drive. Not only does it make you feel alive and driven, but it\u2019s also an important indicator that your hormones are optimized and balanced for total health, fitness & longevity.\n\nTestosterone is a very important hormone that controls libido and sexual performance, in both men and women.\n\nUnfortunately, over the past decade or two, due to a big drop in testosterone levels \u2013 again, for both men AND women \u2013 sexual desire has been reported to be very low.\n\nTongkat Ali Clinical Study\n\nNow, there\u2019s a clinical study in humans, not rats. Both men and women use an herb called Tongkat Ali (an extract of the Eurycoma longifolia bush).\n\nThe people in the study were all physically fit, but older \u2013 aged 57-72.\n\nThey use Tongkat Ali every day for 5 weeks. They measured various hormones, such as total and free testosterone, cortisol, IGF-1, and DHEA.\n\nThey also testest grip strength.\n\nThe results of the study were very interesting. While levels of cortisol, IGF-1, and DHEA remained largely unchanged, free and total testosterone levels went up significantly in both men and women, and so did grip strength.\n\nOne really cool thing to see from this graph is that the total testosterone levels basically DOUBLED in the 5 weeks. It went from about 0.5 to about 1.1\n\nAnd free testosterone went from about 0.35 to 0.55, which is near doubling \u2013 again, still very good as far as a blood test.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean everyone will get similar results. However, it\u2019s a significant increase \u2013 especially in humans, regardless of age, male or female.\n\nRemember, testosterone is anabolic and thus, it\u2019s good for muscle size and strength.\n\nHow Tongkat Ali Works?\n\nThe testosterone increase in men happened by two mechanisms. One was the increase in LH and FSH, which tells your testicles to produce more testosterone. The second was by the lowering of estradiol, an estrogen \u2013 which then causes an increase in testosterone.\n\nIn women, the primary cause of increased testosterone was caused by a significant decline in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). This causes an increase in FREE testosterone levels \u2013 the more active testosterone.\n\nBoth men and women saw an increase in both total and free testosterone levels. This would then cause an increase in muscle mass if you exercise, improved strength, better mood, higher energy levels, and yes, a much higher sex drive.\n\nThe ideal dose for Tongkat Ali is between 200-400 mg daily. However, it\u2019s most important that you use the correct extract form at a 100:1 ratio. Many companies simply use the \u201croot\u201d form, which is dead and has no positive effects.\n\nKeep in mind that there are many other factors that go into boosting testosterone levels and more importantly, keeping things at optimal levels long term. Such as balancing female hormones, DHT, and stress hormones.\n\nThe endocrine system is complicated.\n\nThis is why I utilized other ingredients in AlphaViril to achieve even better results, safely and quickly.\n\nAnd yes, AlphaViril works for both men and women, young and old. That\u2019s why it has over 22+ years of proven track record.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

What are the signs that I have erectile dysfunction? How do I know if it\u2019s not just in my head, but a real physical problem?\u201d\n\nHey Joey\u2026 this is definitely NOT a \u201cdumb\u201d question and I\u2019m really glad you\u2019ve asked it because I can guarantee that MOST men have asked themselves a similar question.\n\nI can say this with confidence because many guys have come to me asking something similar and it wasn\u2019t just from \u201colder\u201d men in their 60\u2019s. Young guys in their 20\u2019s have asked me this as well.\n\nIn a minute I\u2019ll give you proven and natural solutions if you suffer impotency or you\u2019re worried about erectile dysfunction.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s first talk about the TRUE definition of ED\u2026\n\nIf you can\u2019t get or keep an erection, on a regular basis \u2014 then chances are you may have some sort of erectile dysfunction or \u201cimpotence\u201d1\n\nIf it happens occasionally, that\u2019s normal and it\u2019s not a big deal. Chances are, you\u2019re under extra stress and typically it\u2019s EMOTIONAL stress, even more so than physical stress.\n\nIf you wake up with morning erections\u2026 or you can get hard while masturbating,\u2026 then it\u2019s not ED and it has more to do with your mind.\n\nTypically, a problem with your relationship\u2026 Or you\u2019re feeling self-conscious or insecure about something. Being anxious or nervous can definitely cause \u201climp\u201d issues.\n\nHowever, if your erectile \u201cchallenges\u201d are slowly and consistently getting worse, then it probably is a physical problem and chances are, a hormonal imbalance\u2026\n\nAnd the good news is that you can fix this and I\u2019ll show you how in a minute\u2026\n\nPlease Pay Attention carefully\u2026\n\nThe truth is that ALL men have problems with erections at some point in their lives.\n\nOver 40+ million American men are affected by ED2 \u2026 and these are the ones that admit to it. And the older you are, the worse this problem is because of hormonal imbalances.\n\nAnd you know what, IT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT!!!\n\nWe live in a world with a lot more stress \u2014 both physical and emotional. The foods we eat, the air we breathe, the stupid prescriptions drugs doctors force us to take and so forth \u2026.\n\nALL negatively affect your hormones and cause a lowering of testosterone, which is required for erections and sex drive.\n\nOn the opposite end, as testosterone drops there\u2019s an increase in hormones that NEGATIVELY affect your libido, such as stress hormones like cortisol and female hormones estrogen, progesterone and prolactin.\n\nAnyways, I get into more detail about this, including how to fix all of this, when you visit the link below this video. But what\u2019s important to know is that you\u2019re not alone, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you and there is hope and you can definitely fix this, naturally!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20537171\n\nhttp://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/ED/index.aspx",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/testosterone-does-not-increase-sex-drive-libido-new-study/",
    "content": "You\u2019ve probably heard me and many others say that testosterone is one of the primary hormones that control your sex drive and libido\u2026 in both men and women. In fact, almost all animals.\n\nHowever, a recent study presented by urologists in Boston, stated that total testosterone does NOT control your libido.\n\nApparently, your FREE testosterone levels contribute to your sex drive. Even more so, the specific ratio between free testosterone and estradiol levels \u2013 which is the most potent type of estrogen.\n\nTo simplify the study for you, the researchers measured the patients\u2019 total testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and free testosterone levels\u2026 And then compared these hormonal values with their reported libidos.\n\nWhat the researchers discovered was that total testosterone levels were NOT correlated with libido and how often you want to have sex.\n\nHowever, what did matter was FREE testosterone levels, especially when compared to estradiol levels.\n\nBasically, higher FREE testosterone levels and lower estradiol levels were correlated with higher libido.\n\nUnfortunately, the researchers didn\u2019t say what was the best or ideal ratio between these hormones. However, it is interesting because one major problem over the past couple of decades is that men\u2019s total AND free testosterone levels are dropping lower and lower, while estradiol and female hormones are going higher and higher.\n\nNot only is this bad for your sex performance and desire\u2026 but it also means muscle and strength loss, depression and moodiness, more body fat, lower energy levels, man boobs and gynecomastia, and well\u2026 the simple fact that you are going to look and feel like an old man.\n\nSo, now that we know the problem and this is something I\u2019ve stated many times in previous videos, let\u2019s talk about the solutions.\n\nOf course, we\u2019d like to increase your total testosterone levels because that still has many positive benefits.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s focus on increasing your FREE testosterone levels even more \u2013 this is the more active testosterone.\n\nTo do this, we need to lower SHBG.\n\nAdditionally, we want to lower excess levels of estradiol. Interestingly, higher estradiol levels increase SHBG\u2026 So by decreasing estradiol, we\u2019ll have two benefits at the same time.\n\nSo, what are the best ways to accomplish these two tasks and to do so naturally and safely?\n\nLowering SHBG & Increasing Free Testosterone\n\nLet\u2019s first focus on lowering SHBG and thus, increasing your free testosterone levels.\n\nAs far as your diet, both protein and carbs are important. So, no or low-carb diets \u2013 such as ketogenic or carnivore or similar diets have been shown to actually LOWER free testosterone, which is NOT what we want.\n\nYou can also take supplements. The best are:\n\nZinc Picolinate, which should be taken with copper to balance it.\n\nUtilize herbal extracts such as Testofen Fenugreek, Stinging Nettle, Tongkat Ali, and ashwagandha are some of the best.\n\nYou can get all of these in one supplement called AlphaViril.\n\nNext, we want to lower excess estradiol levels.\n\nLosing body fat is very important because your fat cells produce more aromatase enzyme, which converts testosterone to estrogens.\n\nEating more vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts also help because of the chemicals these vegetables contain which help lower estrogen.\n\nAlso, two of the best supplements are DIM and white button mushroom extract.\n\nBoth of these ingredients are also found in AlphaViril.\n\nRemember, as I\u2019ve stated many times in previous videos \u2013 your goal should never be to \u201conly\u201d increase testosterone levels. The body and endocrine system are very complicated.\n\nAnd what we\u2019ve learned today, is you also want to increase your FREE testosterone levels, while decreasing high estradiol levels.\n\nMind you, today we didn\u2019t even discuss three other important hormones \u2013 DHT, Prolactin, and Cortisol, which are also very important and need to be balanced.\n\nWhich I\u2019ll cover in future articles, so make sure you stay tunned.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Arginine, Citrulline, or L-Lysine?\n\nL-lysine has not been linked to anything related to erectile dysfunction. It doesn\u2019t cause it or help it.\n\nAs far as the other two amino acids \u2013 yes, L Arginine is linked to better erections because it helps increase nitric oxide levels.\n\nThis is how PDE-5 inhibitors, such as Viagra and Cialis work.\n\nOver time, another Amino acid was released to the market named L-Citrulline. This amino acid also helps increase nitric oxide levels.\n\nIn fact, Citrulline works by converting to arginine in the body.\n\nWhich Is Better \u2013 Arginine or Citrulline?\n\nAlthough research has shown that both arginine and citrulline boost levels of nitric oxide in the body, the most recent research show that citrulline may actually deliver the most benefit.\n\nCitrulline may expand blood vessels to a greater extent than arginine. And this is because your body uses arginine for a variety of functions, so it doesn\u2019t use all of the Arginine it absorbs to produce Nitric Oxide.\n\nThe combination of the two, Arginine and Citrulline works the best And research also shows this to be true.\n\nAdding pycnogenol (pine bark extract) to Arginine and Citrulline further increases Nitric Oxide levels.\n\nNow, before you go out and start using these ingredients, please know something very important:\n\nIncreasing testosterone levels also increase nitric oxide levels and does so MORE than taking these amino acids.\n\nTaking substances that increase Nitric Oxide \u2013 such as arginine and citrulline, or viagra and Cialis, works MUCH better in men who have higher testosterone levels.\n\nIf you want better erections and sexual performance:\n\nIncrease your testosterone\n\nAlso, decrease negative \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones such as female like estrogen and stress hormones like cortisol.\n\nThen take nitric oxide boosters, such as arginine, with citrulline and pycnogenol.\n\nThis 3-part proven formula works the best and this is exactly why I formulated AlphaViril \u2013 because I wanted an all-in-one solution for myself.\n\nMuch better results.

    "content": "You can increase the size of your testicles and it doesn\u2019t require any drugs. There\u2019s a special food or drink that has been shown to do this.\n\nAnd yes, increasing testicle size can also increase testosterone levels \u2013 and I\u2019ll let you know how and why.\n\nMice With Big Testicles (15% Bigger!)\n\nA few years ago researchers discovered that when mice consumed a special type of yogurt, they started to walk funny.\n\nWhen they turned them over, they noticed that their testicles had grown about 15% in size.\n\nThe mice also grew shinier coats and fur. Plus, their hair or \u201cfollicular\u201d density was also 10X more.\n\nBut, does this mean the same results in humans?\u2026\n\nWell, studies have shown that ingesting yogurt and other low-fat dairy foods improves semen quality in humans.\n\nThey\u2019ve also discovered that a special type of bacteria or probiotic has been linked to these amazing results and the name of it is \u201cLactobacillus reuteri\u201d [lacto-bas-ilis root-er-i] or L. Reuteri\n\nSperm production is much lower these days than it was 50+ years ago. Same as testosterone levels.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that in the 1960s, about 40% of the population had some L- Reuteri in their guts. While these days, it\u2019s around only 10-15%\n\nNow, this special bacterium helps maintain or increase the number of Leydig cells in the testes and Leydig cells are responsible for producing testosterone. The end result is the testicles grow in size and produce more testosterone.\n\nThere are additional benefits as well to L. Reuteri \u2013 it helps lower IL-17, which is negatively involved in inflammation, obesity, and various autoimmune diseases.\n\nModern American yogurts typically contain only 2 to 5 strains of bacteria and this \u201ctesticle growing\u201d L. reuteri, isn\u2019t usually one of them.\n\nHowever, the good news is that American-made Kefir does!\n\nWhat Is Kefir [Kah-fear]?\n\nKefir is a milk product made from grains of bacteria and yeast. The end product is a slightly sour, slightly fermented beverage that even most lactose intolerant people can drink, without having stomach issues.\n\nAside from containing more bacterial species, some studies have shown that the bacteria in kefir seem to be more \u201cfaithful\u201d than those found in yogurt. In other words, the bacteria in the kefir attach to the lining of the gut and form colonies instead of dying off or being excreted.\n\nThere is one big problem with Kefir \u2013 these days, the food industry likes to make everything taste better and it now comes in a variety of flavors. All of which are sweetened with a ton of sugar.\n\nJust drink regular Kefir with NO added sugars.

    "content": "Let\u2019s get started with today\u2019s subscriber question:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 I\u2019m dating a new girl, things are great. But, I\u2019m having a hard time getting aroused, more often. She wants to have sex more than me and after I have an orgasm, I can\u2019t get hard again or have another orgasm for at least another couple of days. I\u2019m 47 and it obviously wasn\u2019t like this when I was younger. How can I fix this?\u201d\n\nThis is a very interesting topic to me and one that I used to deal with when I had a few \u201cporn star\u201d clients many years ago. In fact, that\u2019s when I also learned the secrets to growing your penis, which I\u2019ll make a video about soon.\n\nThe time between your orgasms and your ability to get an erection again is called the Refractory Period or Sexual Refractory Period.\n\nLet\u2019s Go Back In Time\n\nLike most guys, when I was younger, in my teenage years and going through puberty, I was always super horny and could have orgasms all the time, whenever, wherever.\n\nEven in my 20s, I could have done it every day and even twice a day if I didn\u2019t have work or wasn\u2019t busy or stressed out.\n\nHowever, as I got older, it did become more difficult to get erections and especially have orgasms as often. Every day, let alone even twice a day.\n\nIt would slowly turn into every other day or maybe 2-3x weekly.\n\nSure, I was busier, and had more responsibilities and stresses in life \u2013 but still, something had changed and I wasn\u2019t happy about it. I felt older.\n\nOf course, like every challenge or problem in my life, I seek out the solution.\n\nWhat Is The Cause Of Longer Sexual Refractory Period?\n\nOf course, there\u2019s never ONE cause for any ONE problem, especially in the human body where things are super complicated.\n\nBut lots of evidence points to Dopamine.\n\nThus, higher levels of dopamine REDUCE the refractory period. This means as dopamine levels go up, it\u2019s easier to get aroused and orgasm sooner and more often.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that dopamine also helps regulate prolactin secretion. This means that as dopamine levels go up, Prolactin levels come down or are lower.\n\nAnd higher prolactin increases refractory periods. In fact, after you have an orgasm, Prolactin levels go up and hence, the refractory period.\n\nLet\u2019s pause for a second and make it simple \u2013 we want higher dopamine and lower prolactin.\n\nAs we age, prolactin levels can go higher and hence, longer refractory periods, and thus, it takes you longer to get aroused, hard, and have an orgasm.\n\nHere\u2019s Something Super Interesting\n\nHaving intercourse and thus, SEX with a partner \u2013 increases prolactin levels by 400% MORE than if you masturbate by yourself.\n\nThis means, that having an orgasm with a sexual partner, more specifically in the study \u2013 it was penile-vaginal intercourse, can dramatically increase your prolactin levels and thus, your refractory period \u2013 than if you just masturbated by yourself.\n\nSo, circling back\u2026 If you want to decrease refractory periods, so you can get aroused sooner and have another orgasm faster, then the goal is to improve your dopamine levels, which will then also lower Prolactin.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m oversimplifying the process \u2013 but, let\u2019s stick to the basics, so you can get results right away.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve experimented with lots of dopamine types of substances over the years, as well as prolactin inhibitors. Supplements, as well as drugs.\n\nSo, I can promise you that when you do this correctly, it works for sure. It doesn\u2019t matter if you make porn movies or if you\u2019re a regular guy that wants to satisfy his wife more often.\n\nThe problem is that these days, due to modern life and mainly the internet, we are getting massive hits of dopamine all day long and this decreases dopamine levels and dopamine receptor sensitivity.\n\nSo we need more and more, to get the same positive dopamine benefits.\n\nSo, What Are The Solutions And Options?\n\nI\u2019m not going to talk about dopaminergic drugs or prolactin inhibitors because they have lots of side effects when used incorrectly. Besides, 98% of you can\u2019t get your hands on such drugs \u2013 so, why talk about them?\n\nInstead, let\u2019s discuss what you CAN do, that\u2019s natural, legal, and safe.\n\nOne of the best ways for increasing dopamine is to increase your testosterone levels. The best part is you get all the benefits of BOTH testosterone AND dopamine. In fact, both work with each other. What\u2019s interesting is an increase in dopamine, increases testosterone, and vice/versa!\n\nThis is also why you\u2019re more driven when you\u2019re younger \u2013 emotionally, physically and of course, sexually. Testosterone is higher when you\u2019re younger a starts to drop in your late 20s.\n\nThere\u2019s also an herb called Mucuna Pruriens Extract. It contains a compound called L-DOPA, which is a direct precursor to Dopamine and also helps promote healthy levels of Prolactin.\n\nAlso, Vitamin B6 helps minimize prolactin levels.\n\nBoth of these two ingredients, as well as half a dozen testosterone-boosting herbal extracts, are in AlphaViril \u2013 that\u2019s why the product has had scientifically proven results for over 20+ years.\n\nI formulated it for myself originally because of these exact problems I started to have in my 30\u2019s\n\nSo, there you have it \u2013 improving dopamine levels, which will lower Prolactin levels. Taking Mucuna Pruriens Extract and Vitamin B6 will help with both of these.\n\nAnd most importantly, increase your testosterone and improve your hormones \u2026 which will further improve dopamine levels and thus, bigger, harder, fuller erections more often.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Allow me to share the 4 foods you shouldn\u2019t eat before sex\u2026 to save you embarrassment, pain, and suffering.\n\nWhen you\u2019re going to have sex, you want to make sure you SMELL good and more importantly, do NOT smell bad. Obviously, good hygiene, shower, cologne, and fresh breath matter.\n\nHowever, WHAT you eat also makes a difference as soon as you eat.\n\nSo, how are different ways you can smell bad? Well, anything that comes out of your \u201choles\u201d \u2013 this is your mouth, anus, and your urethra.\n\nAs far as your mouth is concerned \u2013 don\u2019t have any garlic or onions. Not only will your breath smell, but so will your entire body. The foul odor just leaks out of your skin\u2026\n\nRegarding what comes out of your ass, this includes anything that\u2019s going to cause you to get gassy \u2013 so, let\u2019s just do away with almost all vegetables. They have too much fiber and different enzymes that required proper digestion, which can cause gas and bloating.\n\nFinally, we have your urethra and that\u2019s basically where you urinate. There is one food, more specifically a vegetable, that will make your urine smell badly and potentially your cum as well\u2026 And that\u2019s the vegetable, asparagus.\n\nMost of us are lactose intolerant and thus, you shouldn\u2019t eat anything that contains dairy. This is milk, butter, ice cream, and so forth.\n\nYou\u2019ll get very bloaty and gassy \u2013 again, NOT cool!\n\nI know most of you will hate this since I know many people need a drink or two before having sex. It allows them to relax and lower their inhibitions.\n\nUnfortunately, alcohol does lots of negative things which will cause you to not perform well. Thus, not being able to get a good erection or maintain one.\n\nAnd nothing turns a woman off or ruins the sexual moment like a limp dick.\n\nI love carbs, who doesn\u2019t? Especially when you go out to a nice restaurant and have a good meal, you\u2019re going to end up having carbs \u2013 maybe a lot of it.\n\nThis is a bad idea for a variety of reasons.\n\ncarbs will increase serotonin levels, which can reduce your sex drive.\n\ncarbs will cause you to feel tired and sluggish, which you don\u2019t want before sex \u2013 especially if it\u2019s late in the evening when you\u2019re already getting tired.\n\ncarbs cause gas and bloating. Again, similar to vegetables and dairy.\n\nThus, you need to avoid or limit all carbs \u2013 bread, pasta, potatoes, and even fruit). However, there is ONE carb I do like and that\u2019s white rice \u2013 it\u2019s easy to digest, no bloat or gas.\n\nNow, if cutting carbs wasn\u2019t bad enough, you should also limit fatty cuts of meat \u2013 such as steak, hamburger, hot dogs, and similar proteins.\n\nAnd the main reason for this is weaker blood flow throughout your body \u2013 and this includes your penis and thus, your ability to get a hard erection.\n\nFor protein, stick to something like baked or broiled fish and roasted chicken.\n\nI know\u2026 the meal is going to look very bland and boring \u2013 white rice + chicken or fish.\n\nBut, it\u2019ll allow you to perform your best.\n\nAlso, make sure you optimize your testosterone levels so you can increase your sex drive, and get harder fuller erections.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Higher testosterone levels actually help support healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.\n\nWhen you naturally boost your testosterone levels to higher levels within the normal, youthful range \u2013 every aspect of your body improves \u2013 muscles, organs, bones, brain, and mood.\n\nMyth 3 \u2013 High testosterone causes early death\n\nThe final myth has to do with both the earlier mentioned myths which would cause early death \u2013 prostate and heart problems.\n\nNew studies clearly show that higher testosterone levels are linked to a lower risk of \u201call-cause mortality\u201d. And one large study showed a 21% lower risk of death with higher testosterone levels.\n\nAgain, this all comes down to having naturally higher testosterone levels, within a normal range, and having a youthful hormonal balance.

    "content": "The topic of libido and testosterone is always a popular one with my male audience. I\u2019ve got a lot of private messages from guys thanking me for the solutions and fixes I\u2019ve given and how their testosterone levels, sex drive, libido, and erections have improved tremendously.\n\nHowever, I have also received follow-up questions from guys such as:\n\nDo these same solutions work for women\u2026such as wives or girlfriends?\n\nMy wife/girlfriend wants to know if there\u2019s anything specific for women?\n\nDo the same vitamins, herbs and supplements that work in men, also work for women?\n\nThus, it\u2019s not only us guys who want better libido and need higher testosterone but women also.\n\nAnd guess what, the research also shows that women are dealing with a very similar \u201clow testosterone\u201d epidemic the men are \u2013 which is also negatively affecting their libido, sexual happiness, and ability to achieve orgasms.\n\nNot to mention, improved mood, muscle tone, and fat loss.\n\nHowever, since this can be a very detailed and long topic, I\u2019ve decided to keep it short with just a few of the basics and the best solutions, since that\u2019s what most of us care about.\n\nThere are numerous studies showing that well over 55-60% of women, between the ages of 18-65 are suffering from \u201csexual dysfunction\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of fixing the root cause of this problem, which is usually hormonal, these poor women are referred to counseling or a therapist and are then diagnosed with depression or some other \u201cemotional\u201d issue\u2026\n\nAnd then they\u2019re given drugs that further decrease their libido.\n\nJust remember, all animals produce testosterone and all the same hormones. It\u2019s just that women and men produce different amounts. Thus, men typically produce more testosterone than women and women produce more female hormones such as estrogen and progesterone than men.\n\nHowever, we all respond similarly to these hormones.\n\nThus, women also need the right amount and levels of testosterone. In fact, they are much more sensitive to testosterone than men. Thus, when it drops they really feel the negatives, and when it\u2019s up they really feel the positives.\n\nSome of the same things that cause low testosterone in men are also the same in women.\n\nFor example, extra stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, vegetarian diet, high soy intake, not exercising, gaining body fat, and so forth.\n\nAs well as drugs such as blood pressure, antibiotics, sleeping pills, alcohol (yes, wine is alcohol), marijuana and others.\n\nAs well as SSRI drugs, such as Prozac, which are used for depression and similar symptoms,\u2026. Unfortunately, these are prescribed more to women than men.\n\nHowever, there is ONE major cause that\u2019s very specific for women and that\u2019s birth control pills.\n\nRemember, birth control pills or injections are typically two female hormones, estrogen and/or progesterone, which reduce sex drive directly and then indirectly by lower testosterone.\n\nThus, that\u2019s a double punch!\n\nAs far as drugs or pharmaceutical methods, just like men, you would do testosterone replacement therapy.\n\nAnd just with men, I suggest this to be the LAST option, especially for women.\n\nFor men, the problem is that once you start with the testosterone injections, you really can\u2019t stop. It shuts down your testicles and thus, it\u2019s going to be a life-long, permanent treatment.\n\nAnd if men want to have kids, forget about it \u2013 you won\u2019t be producing any sperm. In fact, testosterone therapy is a male contraceptive, and thus, the \u201cmale birth control\u201d\n\nAnyway, the biggest problem with women taking testosterone is that they are hypersensitive to it and it can quickly cause hair loss in them, increase body hair, especially on the face and also deepen their voice over time.\n\nFor a guy, these things won\u2019t happen and don\u2019t really matter \u2013 that\u2019s normal.\n\nBut definitely NOT for women. It\u2019ll make them more manly and less feminine.\n\nAnd trust me, most HRT \u2013 hormone replacement doctors \u2013 are using way too high a dose for women, as well as men too.\n\nThere is an awesome sexual response initially, which is soon followed by potentially permanent side effects such as balding, facial hair, clitorial growth, voice change, and so forth.\n\nSo, as always, let\u2019s FIRST focus on natural solutions.\n\nThere are a few supplements that work very well for women.\n\nOne of them is DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone). This is more of a precursor hormone for testosterone. It\u2019s produced mostly in the adrenal glands.\n\nUnfortunately, this hormone peaks in your early 20s, and thus, it\u2019s a good idea to optimize it. And the cool part is that it\u2019s over the counter, at least here in the US.\n\nI would start at a lower dose of 10 mg taken in the morning with food. See how you feel for a couple of weeks and increase to 25 and then 50 mg IF needed.\n\nBoron is another supplement that works well in both men and women. I\u2019d start with 5 mg and increase it to 10 mg as needed.\n\nThe mineral zinc is also very helpful. Make sure you take it with copper because these two minerals need to be balanced.\n\nLastly, there are specific and potent herbs that help increase testosterone levels in men, as well as women. These include:\n\n\u2026 and a few other ones.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re a man or woman\u2026 and you want to improve your libido, sexual performance, and sensations\u2026 improve muscle mass and fat loss\u2026 enhance your mood and happiness\u2026 then make sure you\u2019ve optimized your testosterone levels and have youthful hormonal balance.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "I don\u2019t even know where to start with today\u2019s video because it\u2019s just riddled with bad news for us guys. Especially for all of you guys who have NOT taken action on my previous videos about boosting your testosterone levels, naturally\u2026\n\nBut, I guess I\u2019ll start from the beginning\u2026\n\nOne of my subscribers to my private newsletter emailed me a few reports and asked:\n\nDr. Robbins \u2013 is it true that the average 22-year-old man has the SAME testosterone levels as a 67-year-old man did, just 20 years ago?\u2026 I know in the past you\u2019ve said how men\u2019s testosterone levels are much lower these days, but are things truly this bad now? If yes, what\u2019s the cause and the solution?\n\nWell, depending on which study you\u2019re looking at, the numbers are different.\n\nWhat Do The Numbers Say?\n\nHowever, the bottom line is always the same result. There are dozens of human studies clearly showing that yes, men\u2019s testosterone levels are much lower these days.\n\nNot just a little bit either\u2026\n\nBut as low as 50% less to as much as 140% less, compared to the year, 2000 \u2013 that\u2019s just a little over 20 years ago.\n\nRegardless of the study, or if it\u2019s 25% or 150% \u2026 it\u2019s a big drop.\n\nNow, the same trend also follows because other studies have shown historically low:\n\nAnd even decreased sexual activity by men, especially younger guys (ie: erectile problems)\n\nThere are also high rates of:\n\ndepression in men, especially younger men \u2013 and yes, testosterone controls mood\n\nGynocomastia or \u201cman boobs\u201d \u2013 and yes, this is because of lower testosterone and higher estrogen levels and other hormonal imbalances\n\nYou get the point\u2026 things are just getting worse each year.\n\nThe bottom line is that in modern society, men are becoming LESS manly \u2013 hormonally, physically and yes, even emotionally.\n\nEven women are complaining that men aren\u2019t men anymore, at least \u2013 not like they used to be.\n\nBut, that\u2019s a different topic for another day.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Cause Of Low Testosterone?\n\nOkay, it\u2019s clear most guys do NOT have maximal testosterone levels and optimal hormonal balance.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the cause, and more importantly, what can you do to reverse and fix this negative trend?\n\nWell, the honest answer is that it\u2019s never just ONE main cause. It\u2019s usually a few key factors.\n\nThere are a few big problems\n\nSTRESS \u2013 is a major one. Not as much physical stress, but emotional & mental stress. Poor sleep is a big stressor. In fact, people are getting 20% less sleep now, than just 20 years ago.\n\nDIET \u2013 yes, diet is a major issue. Less whole foods are being eaten today and more packaged foods that aren\u2019t natural. We are lacking key nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and herbs.\n\nEXERCISE \u2013 Most people aren\u2019t moving much. They have more fat and less muscle. Then there are those who are working out too much, too often, and too hard.\n\nENVIRONMENT \u2013 and then there\u2019s stuff that we can\u2019t even control, like environmental factors like what\u2019s found in the foods we eat, water, electronic devices, and so forth.\n\nAll of these factors are creating hormonal imbalances and basically, making you less manly and more feminine.\n\nAnd you can tell in the way guys act, think, look and perform \u2013 especially in the bedroom.\n\nHowever, the good news is that all of this can be turned around and fixed \u2013 regardless of your age.\n\nAnd NO, you don\u2019t have to follow any crazy or restrictive diets. Or exercise a couple of hours daily. Or completely unplug from modern technology and devices. Or have to take a bunch of lame supplements that most don\u2019t work.\n\nJust small changes you can make, that will cause big improvements in your hormones.\n\nI want to keep things simple, convenient, and easy for you \u2013 so you can take action NOW, get positive results tomorrow and continue to improve long-term.\n\nSo, while it\u2019s fresh in your mind, take a look at the best, clinically proven ways to naturally boost your testosterone levels and optimize your hormones.\n\nPlease don\u2019t procrastinate\u2026 this problem isn\u2019t going to magically fix itself and the older you get, the worst the problem and the harder it is to fix.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s article is very important for anyone who has ever considered taking testosterone medication \u2013 injections, creams or pills. Whether it\u2019s for hormone or testosterone replacement therapy (HRT / TRT) or simply for gaining muscle.\n\nI actually get a lot of questions about this topic and I want to share an email I got from Davis:\n\nDear Dr. Sam \u2013 I\u2019m in a big mess. I\u2019m 48 years old and my doctor put me on testosterone injections because I had Low T. I\u2019m doing 200 mgs (1 ml) every 2 weeks. The first month was good \u2013 I had more energy, higher libido and felt happier.\n\nBut now, 3 months later and the REVERSE has happened. My sex drive is gone, my testicles have shrunk, I\u2019m losing head hair, and my nipples are itchy and puffy \u2014 I read that this is the beginning of getting man boobs or gynecomastia!!?!\n\nAfter every shot, I also break out in pimples for a few days, like a teenager.\n\nSo I finally decided to just stop taking the shots and oh my lord, things got even worse. My doctor says I need to do more blood work but he doesn\u2019t have time to see me for another 2 weeks, what should I do right now??? Please help, I\u2019m desperate.\n\nUnfortunately, this problem is actually very common with \u201cexogenous\u201d testosterone \u2013 meaning \u201cfrom the outside\u201d with the use of injections, pills or creams. Most doctors don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing when prescribing such powerful hormones.\n\nThe endocrine system (hormones) is very complicated and the average GP doctor is clueless. Heck, even most endocrinologists (hormone doctors) screw things up.\n\nAs you may know, this is actually my area of expertise as a doctor. My degree is in Medical Pharmacology with an emphasis on endocrinology and antiaging medicine.\n\nSo I know the details about drugs, hormones, and how all of these things work together.\n\nAnd trust me, science barely knows how the body works, let alone for each individual person and their specific genetics.\n\nNow, before I address Davis\u2019 problem and help fix it \u2013 the next minute or two will seem a little complicated. However, if you\u2019ve ever considered taking testosterone or your currently on it, you REALLY MUST read this article.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll simplify it at the very end.\n\nThe first thing Davis needs to do is get BACK on the testosterone injections, right away!\n\nBy not taking any testosterone, there\u2019s a big imbalance \u2026 and the ratio of female hormones (estrogens) is HIGHER than testosterone and that\u2019s why he\u2019s about to get gynecomastia (man boobs), has no sex drive, and feels like junk.\n\nBasically, he\u2019s got more estrogen than testosterone.\n\nI don\u2019t know his medical history or his genetics, so I can\u2019t advise much more.\n\nHowever, if he was my patient, things would have been done very differently.\n\nFirst of all, shots should be taken not once every TWO weeks, but at a minimum of once a week and preferably twice weekly.\n\nJust take a lower dosage, but more often.\n\nSo instead of 200 mgs every 14 days, you\u2019d take 100 mgs every 7 days or preferably, 50 mgs every 3 days or twice weekly.\n\nTestosterone injections (cypionate or enanthate) are typically in your system for about a week. So you get a big initial spike for the first 3 days, then a drop by day 5 and back to normal by day 7. From day 8-14, week #2, you\u2019re BELOW normal.\n\nThat\u2019s why Davis would get zits after every shot \u2013 there was a huge surge in testosterone.\n\nSecondly, testosterone converts to estrogens (estradiol, estrone, etc.) in your system through various enzymes, more specifically aromatase enzyme.\n\nPlus, the higher your body fat, the higher your estrogen. And the older you are, the higher your aromatase enzyme and thus, even more estrogen.\n\nSo once Davis takes his testosterone shot, his estrogen will start to go up and thus, lower and \u201cdeplete\u201d the testosterone. The testosterone converts more to estrogen. You don\u2019t want that.\n\nYou\u2019re losing all the benefits of testosterone.\n\nSo, you need to take an estrogen/aromatase inhibitor to prevent the increase in estrogens, so your testosterone continues to stay up.\n\nThis is why smaller, more frequent shots are best because there aren\u2019t high spikes of estrogen.\n\nHigher estrogen also typically leads to higher prolactin, another female hormone. This further causes more sexual problems and also hair loss.\n\nSpeaking of hair loss, testosterone also converts to DHT, the hair loss hormone. So this side-effect ALSO needs to be addressed through a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor. Propecia or Proscar are more popular medications.\n\nHowever, many guys become impotent taking this drug. So it\u2019s best to do it naturally through various supplements like Zinc for example.\n\nIn regards to why after 3 months Davis doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d it anymore and on top of it, his testicles have shrunk\u2026 This is because when you take exogenous testosterone \u2013 from the outside \u2013 whether it\u2019s injected, pills or creams, you signal your testicles to STOP producing testosterone.\n\nThere\u2019s no need since you are adding to it with a drug.\n\nAnd because your testicles are no longer needing to produce any testosterone, they shrink in size.\n\nSo, a good doctor would have also prescribed Davis another drug called, HCG (Human chorionic gonadotropin). Simply stated, HCG tells your testicles to continue producing testosterone and thus, your testicles don\u2019t shrink.\n\nBottom Line & Summary\n\nListen, I can go on and on, but I hope you get the point.\n\nTaking testosterone medications has many benefits. However, it\u2019s a lifelong commitment. You need a really good doctor to monitor everything. You\u2019ll need to take additional drugs, at least 2-3 extra ones, just to manage the side effects of the testosterone. You\u2019ll also need to do regular blood tests to see how your body is reacting.\n\nAll of this is time-consuming and expensive.\n\nMy suggestion is that before you start with the testosterone medication, why not try to boost it naturally?\n\nIt\u2019s much safer, costs way less money, it works, it doesn\u2019t have any of the negative side effects.\n\nAnd if the \u201cnatural\u201d method doesn\u2019t work after a few months, THEN go find yourself a really smart doctor and start the testosterone medications.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "There are a variety of causes for erectile problems like hormonal imbalances, poor blood flow, or emotional and psychological issues.\n\nOne Of The Biggest Causes Of ED\n\nHowever, most experts and even doctors never talk about one of the biggest causes of erectile problems and that has to do with sugar.\n\nAs blood sugar levels go up, your body and pancreas release insulin to help lower blood sugar back down to normal, healthy levels.\n\nInsulin interacts with other hormones, such as testosterone, estrogen, prolactin \u2026 and stress hormones like Cortisol\u2026. And also anti-aging hormones such as Growth Hormone and IGF.\n\nSecondly, high blood sugar and erectile problems are related to your circulation and nervous system.\n\nPoorly controlled blood sugar levels can damage small blood vessels and nerves. Damage to the nerves that control sexual stimulation and response, can impede a man\u2019s ability to achieve an erection firm enough to have sexual intercourse.\n\nReduced blood flow from damaged blood vessels further contribute to erectile dysfunction and impotence.\n\nSo, What Does This Mean For You?\n\nSupport healthy blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity, and you\u2019ll definitely improve your ability to have bigger, harder and fuller erections\u2026. In addition to improving your overall health, fitness & longevity.\n\nSo, how do you support healthy blood sugar and insulin sensitivity, so you can also improve your erections?\n\nWell, the short answer is to lose fat and gain muscle.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s easier said than done for most of us.\n\nAnd because of this, I prepared additional resources, articles, and videos about the easiest and fastest ways to have healthy blood sugar & insulin sensitivity.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019ll reveal a very common vitamin, that when used at a specific dosage, is clinically proven to increase your testosterone and libido, after you exercise.\n\nMost people don\u2019t know, but exercise actually DECREASES your testosterone levels. This is especially true for \u201cendurance\u201d exercises such as running, jogging, biking, etc.\n\nEven though lifting weights can actually INCREASE your testosterone levels, for many people this is temporary. Afterward, there is a big drop in testosterone.\n\nSo, Why Does This Happen?\n\nWell, there are lots of reasons.\n\nLower blood sugar due to glucose depletion in your muscles increases your cortisol levels and can cause a decrease in testosterone.\n\nStress on your nervous system (CNS) due to an exhaustive or overly strenuous workout, increases your cortisol and will cause a decrease in your testosterone.\n\nNot eating well, being depleted of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, causes stress on your body and again, raises your cortisol and decreases your testosterone.\n\nAs you see \u2013 the common problem is STRESS and the increase in your cortisol hormone.\n\n3 Ways To Fix The Problem\n\nMake sure you have enough food in your body, before AND after exercise. This means having a good, light meal about an hour or two before exercise. And make sure to eat carbs and protein soon after your workout, to replenish your empty glucose and protein levels.\n\nKeep your workouts short. No more than 30-45 minutes. No more than 3-4x weekly. Don\u2019t kill yourself. You should leave the gym feeling GOOD and refreshed. Not as if you just got done wrestling Kingkong and you\u2019re dead tired.\n\nTake vitamins and herbs after your workout, that is clinically proven to reduce cortisol and increase your testosterone.\n\nAnd one of the simplest ways to do this is to take Vitamin C. Recent research shows that taking about 500 mgs of Vitamin C, before AND after your workout,1 can\n\nDecrease your stress hormone, cortisol.\n\nDramatically reduce the drop in testosterone levels.\n\nImprove sperm count and the desire to have sex.\n\nThere have been many other clinical studies showing how powerful Vitamin C is at reducing stress. Combined with other ingredients that boost your testosterone, you have a winning formula.\n\nHere Is What I Am Doing\u2026\n\nPersonally, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing for years.\n\nAn hour before exercise:\n\nI have a light meal, maybe a protein shake.\n\nI take 1000 mgs of Buffered Vitamin C\n\n2 pills of AlphaViril to boost my testosterone.\n\n30-60 minutes after my workout:\n\nI have another meal, carbs + protein. More calories.\n\nI take more Vitamin C, this time 2000 mgs\n\nAnd I take another 2-3 pill of AlphaViril to decrease my negative hormones and boost my testosterone even further.\n\nCombined with a high dose of Vitamin C, even 500 mg before and after your workout, the combination makes dramatic improvements in your testosterone, muscle mass, fat loss, and sex drive.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "A little while ago I did an article about \u201cProtein Fasting\u201d\u2026 Which you basically eat NO protein for one day, to gain MORE muscle and even lose fat in the process.\n\nIt became super popular and viral, which is great and I\u2019m very thankful I was able to help so many people. However, it led to a lot of questions.\n\nToday I\u2019m going to cover one of the most asked questions, which was:\n\nWhat do I eat exactly on that one, no-protein day?\n\nThe short summary, just so you\u2019re not totally lost today or as a reminder for those that DID read the original article\u2026\n\nIs that you eat no protein at all for one day, for example on a Sunday. Then the rest of the week you eat protein, where you\u2019ll increase the total amounts every 2 days. Thus, Mon/Tues \u2014 then Wed/Thurs and finally, Fri/Sat.\n\nAnd this is because you don\u2019t want your body to adapt and this will increase protein synthesis, improve hormones and allow you to build more muscle and lose fat at the same time.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started on what you should eat on this \u201cprotein-fasting\u201d day since you\u2019ll be eating almost no protein.\n\nAnd this all depends on your goal and genetics.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll give you 3 options \u2013 whether you want to:\n\nOr lose weight, super fast.\n\nJust to make this easier for you to understand, I\u2019m going to give you some simple numbers and you can adapt these to your own personal situation and goals.\n\nLet\u2019s say you weigh 200 lbs (about 90 kgs) and you\u2019re eating 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, which is 200 grams daily and thus, about 800 calories (200 grams x 4 calories = 800 calories)\n\nOn this \u201cprotein-fasting\u201d day, I\u2019ll use Sunday as the example, you\u2019re NOT going to eat anything that\u2019s primarily high in protein. This means no animal proteins (eggs, meats, fish, poultry, dairy, protein powders, etc.)\n\nCarbohydrates: The best-being vegetables, fruits, white rice, yams/sweet potatoes and small amounts of oats. I\u2019d stay away from quinoa and legumes since they\u2019re high in protein for a carb source.\n\nFats: The best being coconut, fish oils, avocados, macadamia, extra virgin olive oil, olives, and walnuts. I\u2019d stay away from all vegetable oils.\n\nIf your goal is to gain muscle because maybe you\u2019re \u201cbulking\u201d or you\u2019re \u201cskinny\u201d and want to gain more weight, then my suggestion is to simply add in MORE carbs on this one day, based on what I recommended earlier.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to then replace the 800 calories of protein, with 800 calories of carbs and fats, but primarily carbs. So we can do 75%/25% and so, that would be 600 calories of carbs (150 grams) and 200 from fat (22 grams)\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re trying to mainly lose fat, then I would do the opposite. From the 800 calories that you are not eating from the protein, I\u2019d do 75% from healthy fats, which is 600 calories (67 grams). And 25% from healthy carbs, which is 200 calories (50 grams).\n\nThis is what I do actually and then on Monday when I \u201crefeed\u201d, BOTH my \u201cprotein sensitivity\u201d and \u201ccarb sensitivity\u201d has improved and I\u2019ll eat more of those.\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re the primary goal is to lose weight fast, then you can just eliminate the 800 calories of protein and eat NOTHING extra that one day and thus, it\u2019s a big calorie deficit, which when done once weekly, can result in at least 1 lb of fat loss every month.\n\nAnd the best part is that this is just for ONE day a week. And since you won\u2019t be making any other sacrifices towards your carbs and fats\u2026. it won\u2019t feel like a regular \u201cdeprivation\u201d diet.\n\nSo, in summary \u2014 No protein for one day, and then on this \u201cprotein fasting\u201d day, you can either\n\neat a lot more carbs,\n\nor just nothing extra and create a big calorie deficit for just ONE day, resulting in fast fat loss\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "So far we\u2019ve learned that people losing hair are aging faster and they have:\n\nlower testosterone levels \u2013 which means less muscle, energy and sex drive\n\nhigher DHT levels \u2013 which means more hair loss, body hair, and prostate problems\n\nBut do you know what\u2019s the cause of these two hormonal imbalances?\n\nIt\u2019s the increase in FEMALE hormones, primarily estrogens, and more specifically, estradiol.\n\nSadly, as estrogen levels rise, so do the other female hormones, such as prolactin, and even progesterone in some cases.\n\nSo why is this so bad and why does it happen?\n\nWell, as estrogen and female hormones go up, it signals your HPTA system (Hypothalamic Pituitary Testicular Axis), to produce LESS testosterone.\n\nA man\u2019s body doesn\u2019t like high estrogen\u2026 that\u2019s more for women.\n\nBecause of this, it has its own, internal \u201cestrogen inhibitor\u201d and that\u2019s DHT \u2013 the HAIR LOSS hormone!\n\nThis is a VERY IMPORTANT concept to understand that 99% of people don\u2019t know, so I\u2019ll repeat it again.\n\nDHT is a natural estrogen inhibitor!\n\nSo now you know why your DHT (the hair loss hormone) levels go up, it\u2019s to lower your \u201chigh\u201d estrogen \u2013 the REAL problem!\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard some guys being referred to as \u201cshort, fat, bald, and hairy\u201d, right?\n\nWell, the \u201cshort and fat\u201d is from higher estrogen.\n\nThe \u201cbald and hairy\u201d is from higher DHT.\n\nYes, genetics plays a big role here, but our environment can make things much worse and speed up the negatives.\n\nSo why does estrogen go up?\n\nWell, there are lots of reasons\u2026\n\nUnfortunately, due to modern society, there are lots of environmental, \u201cexternal\u201d reasons\u2026\n\nSuch as the foods we eat, plastics, chemicals found in everyday stuff, electronic devices, and so forth.\n\nThe good news is a lot of you can control it, but unfortunately, there are just so many things that are out of our control or it\u2019s just not convenient \u2013 like staying away from electronic devices.\n\nThat\u2019s not doable for most of us.\n\nThen there are \u201cinternal\u201d reasons.\n\nTypically, as men age, there is an increase in the \u201caromatase\u201d enzyme, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Which explains why a man\u2019s testosterone starts to drop in his mid 20s and really falls in his 40s and beyond.\n\nSo, aging is a cause\u2026\n\nAdditionally, the higher your body fat, the higher your estrogen levels because your fat cells produce their own estrogen independently.\n\nAnd this turns into a negative cycle because the fatter you are, the more estrogen you produce. And the more estrogen you produce, the fatter you become!\n\nHow Can You Lower Estrogen?\n\nIt\u2019s actually very easy since I\u2019ve done it hundreds of times over the past two decades.\n\nEat more natural, organic foods. Less processed foods.\n\nLimit or reduce anything with plastics, such as bottled waters and Tupperware.\n\nI know it\u2019s almost impossible to reduce electronic device usage. But one thing is to NOT put your cell phone near your testicles and thus, NOT near your lap or in your pocket. Also, don\u2019t microwave your foods, at all\u2026, especially in anything plastic!\n\nAnd take natural estrogen inhibiting herbs such as DIM, Curcumin, and White Button Mushroom Extract. These herbs work really fast and can be almost as powerful as drugs, but without any of the negative side effects.\n\nIn order to fix things and age better, you want to\n\nIncrease your testosterone\n\nNow, we\u2019ve all known how stress is really bad for your health. However, stress is SUPER bad for your testosterone levels and it accelerates hair loss faster than most hormones.\n\nIn fact, in my next article I\u2019ll reveal one of worst causes of hair loss \u2026\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Improving Your Hormones & Reversing + Avoiding HAIR LOSS\n\nAs you get older, starting in your mid 20's (yup, that early!)... you start to have negative changes in your hormones, such as:\n\nlower male hormones (total and free testosterone, DHEA, etc.)\n\nhigher female hormones (estrogens, prolactin, etc.)\n\nhigh stress hormones (cortisol, adrenalin, DHT, etc.)\n\nAll of these negative hormonal changes can lead to less muscle, more belly fat, a decrease in libido and HAIR LOSS!\n\nAnd the secret is to reverse the negative hormonal changes, so you can have similar healthy & youthful levels like you did in your teenage years and early 20's - when you were NOT having any of these negative problems.\n\nThe best part is you can do this naturally - discover how...",

    "content": "I want to share something very important with you\u2026 which I need to share in today\u2019s article because I got an email recently and it seems to be a common problem and I don\u2019t want you to make the same mistake.\n\nJasper wrote to me and said:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing everything right Dr. Sam and my testosterone, libido, erectile problems, belly fat, and so forth haven\u2019t improved at all. I\u2019ve taken a few supplements that increase my testosterone levels. Most didn\u2019t do anything and the ones that did just stopped working after like a week or two. And then I increased the dosage and when things seem to get worse. When I got off of the various \u201ctestosterone boosting supplements\u201d, my situation was even WORSE. I was losing hair, my libido was the lowest it\u2019s been ever and I\u2019m tired all day long. What am I doing wrong?\u2026 I thought increasing my testosterone will fix these problems but it\u2019s made it worse.\u201d\n\nThis is a very common situation I hear all the time.\n\nYou Can\u2019t ONLY Increase Testosterone\n\nThe problem is that you can\u2019t ONLY try and increase your testosterone. Your body will quickly adapt by changing around your other hormones, especially if you\u2019re over the age of 30 and certainly in your 40\u2019s a beyond.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say some herb or supplement increases your testosterone\u2026 soon your body will adapt by increasing SHBG. This will then LOWER your \u201cfree testosterone\u201d, which does all the good stuff.\n\nThe next problem is that the increase in testosterone will convert more to estrogen and other female hormones such as Prolactin. This will now tell your brain and then your testicles to LOWER testosterone\u2026 because as estrogen goes up, testosterone goes down.\n\nThe next problem is that the extra testosterone also converts to DHT \u2013 the balding and prostate hormone. And this, just like estrogen, will LOWER testosterone.\n\nAdditionally, all of this causes stress to your endocrine system and your stress hormone cortisol goes up. This does the exact opposite of Testosterone.\n\nThere are other changes too\u2026 but this is phase 1.\n\nWhy Most Supplements Don\u2019t Work?\n\nIF you\u2019re not blocking these other hormones at the same time, the initial increase in your testosterone from the supplement you were taking will be TEMPORARY and will soon, go back down again and now you are left with LOWER testosterone but also HIGHER \u201cnegative\u201d hormones such as female, DHT, cortisol and so forth.\n\nTHIS is why you\u2019re having problems. THIS is why most supplements don\u2019t work.\n\nThey\u2019re poorly designed by someone who has no understanding of how the human body works.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to keep this article short .. just to let everyone know that it\u2019s NOT your fault if you experience these problems.\n\nThat increasing your testosterone ONLY, will NOT \u201cfix\u201d your problems and will, in fact, make them worse in the long run.\n\nWith that said, I\u2019m not going to leave you empty-handed.\n\nPlease find the link below, where I have revealed all the details of how to fix all of these little issues, so it doesn\u2019t turn into a big problem.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to discuss the pros and cons of using Viagra. You\u2019ll discover how to make it work better.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also reveal the #1 natural alternative to Viagra.\n\nA new discovery that actually works the same way as Viagra, but without any of the negatives. No drugs or diets.\n\nThe Story Behind Viagra\n\nCan you believe that Viagra has been around for over 20 years?\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that Viagra was discovered by accident and was NOT created for improving erections. It was originally designed to lower high blood pressure.\n\nOne of the side \u201cbenefits\u201d was a temporary erection.\n\nHowever, what I find really fascinating is that Viagra\u2019s prices have actually gone UP in the past 2 decades. It used to cost about $25 for a pill, now it costs almost $75 for ONE pill.1 \u2026 I think that\u2019s insane.\n\nBut, I get it. When a man can\u2019t perform, he\u2019ll do almost anything to make \u201cit\u201d work.\n\nAnd yes, there are generics you can buy overseas that costs less, but they are typically underdosed or faked. You could lose your money and you\u2019re also at risk of legal issues with the DEA, Customs, FDA, and so forth.\n\nBut, who cares\u2026 anything to get an erection, right?\u2026\n\nThe Problem With Viagra\n\nUnfortunately, Viagra has a bunch of negative side effects such as:\n\nSinus and nose problems\n\nNausea and stomach issues\n\nBlood pressure issues\n\nHeart and stroke problems\n\nLiver and kidney issues\n\nBut for sex, I think most guys will put up with these side effects. \u2026 at least temporarily.\n\nUnfortunately, there are 3 main problems with Viagra and how well it works or doesn\u2019t work:\n\nViagra doesn\u2019t work in about 35% of users\u2026 and I\u2019ll tell you why in a minute and how this can be fixed. Viagra doesn\u2019t work as well in \u201colder\u201d men over the age of 40. Ironically, it works better and has fewer side effects in younger guys who don\u2019t really need it. Your body adapts to Viagra and it doesn\u2019t work as well over time. The more you use it, the less it works. So if you\u2019re a younger guy using it now, you\u2019re going to have a big problem later on in life. Unfortunately, there is no \u201cfix\u201d for this, other than to NOT use it for a few months and let your \u201creceptors\u201d upgrade.\n\nViagra doesn\u2019t work in about 35% of users\u2026 and I\u2019ll tell you why in a minute and how this can be fixed.\n\nViagra doesn\u2019t work as well in \u201colder\u201d men over the age of 40.

Unfortunately, there is no \u201cfix\u201d for this, other than to NOT use it for a few months and let your \u201creceptors\u201d upgrade.\n\nAnd lastly, there is one other problem most people don\u2019t discuss \u2014 and that\u2019s the fact Viagra does nothing for increasing your sexual desire and drive. It doesn\u2019t increase your libido. It doesn\u2019t put you in the \u201cmood\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cmechanical\u201d solution\u2026 It works by inhibiting the PDE5 enzyme, which then increases blood flow to the penis.\n\nTo sum it up \u2013 we have a very expensive drug, with a bunch of side effects\u2026 That doesn\u2019t work for about 35% of users and works LESS in older guys over the age of 40. And the more you use it, the less it works.\n\nAnd finally, it does nothing to increase your sexual desire and \u201cdrive\u201d.\n\nSo, that\u2019s bad news. Now, let\u2019s move on to the good news.\n\nHow To Make Viagra To Work Better\n\nThe reason Viagra doesn\u2019t work for 35% of people is that these people have \u201clow\u201d testosterone levels.\n\nThis is why in fact, it works better in younger guys because they have higher testosterone\u2026 and it works less in men over the age of 40, who typically have \u201clow\u201d testosterone.\n\nTHUS \u2013 The higher your testosterone, the better Viagra works.\n\nThis is silly because if you had higher testosterone levels, you wouldn\u2019t even need Viagra, to begin with.\n\nBut, you get the point.\n\nSo, if you want to make Viagra work better, you FIRST must improve your testosterone levels. \u2026\n\nBecause with higher testosterone, you\u2019ll have better hormonal balances, Nitric Oxide levels, blood flow, and most importantly \u2013 improved sexual DESIRE and higher libido, which Viagra does nothing for.\n\nBut, who wants to pay $75 for ONE Viagra pill? Or risk health issues?\n\nThe good news is that there\u2019s an herb called Xanthoparmelia Scabrosa, which is an all-natural PDE-5 inhibitor \u2013 just like Viagra.3,4\n\nI first heard about this herb from a research doctor friend of mine in Europe about 3 years ago. He said it worked really well and there were a few human, clinical studies to back it up.\n\nSo I figured I\u2019d give it a try.\n\nBecause it was new, I had a hard time getting my hands on it. But I finally did and gave it a try and the truth is, it didn\u2019t do much.\n\nWell, it only seemed to work when I took a huge dosage of it.\n\nI tried lots of variations of it, dosages, with or without food \u2026 but, nothing really made it work that well. I told my European doctor friend and I sent him a sample to try.\n\nHe tested it and found that there was very little of the active ingredient in it \u2013 the extract, which is \u201cPiperazine\u201d. Which explains why it didn\u2019t work.\n\nIn fact, this is why many supplements and herbs do NOT work \u2014 the manufacturer uses \u201cdead root\u201d or a super low dosage to save money.\n\nIn the process, you and I get ripped off and I HATE that!\n\nSo I tried my best to find a good source, and about 4 months later \u2013 I finally found it, and well, the staff was super expensive.\n\nAt the correct, clinically researched dosage and 35% Piperazine extract, it was going to cost me at least $20 a dose. Sure, it\u2019s better than $75 for a Viagra, but it\u2019s just too expensive and I didn\u2019t really need it anyway.\n\nSo, I put it aside and didn\u2019t give it much thought. But, I never forgot about it.\n\nNatural Alternative To Viagra\n\nThen some new research came out about it like a year ago and I again tried my best to find a good and hopefully, less expensive source.\n\nThe good news is that since my company has grown over the past few years and I\u2019ve made new connections worldwide, I was able to get the correct dosage, 35% extract, picked at the optimal time of the year when the herb is \u201cmature and ripe\u201d.\n\nAnd the best part is that it\u2019s much less expensive than it was 3 years ago.\n\nSo I gave it a try and yes, it worked well.\n\nI then mixed with other herbs that increased my testosterone levels, improved blood flow, and so forth, and WOW \u2013 the solution works GREAT.\n\nIt\u2019s safe. It increases your testosterone, your libido, sex drive, and desire.\n\nAnd it costs WAY less than ONE pill of Viagra.\n\nAnyway, you can read more about this amazing new herb.\n\nPlus view the top best natural ingredients proven to:\n\nIncrease your testosterone levels\n\nDecrease negative hormones\n\nIncrease blood flow to your penis\n\nBoost your sex drive and help fix erectile problems\n\nDo this now \u2013 while it\u2019s fresh on your mind.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.accessrx.com/blog/erectile-dysfunction/viagra/cost-of-buying-viagra-at-cvs-walgreens-and-walmart-pharmacy/\n\nhttps://www.accessrx.com/blog/erectile-dysfunction/3-reasons-why-viagra-may-not-work-and-what-to-do-about-it/\n\nhttps://www.mdidea.com/products/new/new03806.html\n\nXanthoparmelia Scabrosa,X-Scabrosa:Natural Pyrazolo Pyrimidinone.Super PDE-5 Inhibitor and leader material in over-the-counter (OTC) sexual stimulants!",

    "content": "\"Increase My Libido & Testosterone\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb Today I want to discuss ketogenic diets and muscle loss. This week alone I got 3 emails from people telling me they lost a ton of muscle size following a keto diet. It was from 2 men and 1 woman.\n\n\u201cDoc Sam \u2013 I recently followed a ketogenic diet. I paid $100 and got a book, a membership site and so forth because I wanted to do it right. He\u2019s one of these well-know guys on YouTube [I\u2019ve removed his link because I don\u2019t want to say anything negative about this person on Youtube.\n\nIn 4 months, I lost 23 lbs. But I think most of it was just muscle loss because I\u2019m much smaller now, I\u2019m weak and I look \u201cskinny/fat\u201d. My sex drive is gone and I\u2019m cold all the time. I never sweat anymore at the gym. I\u2019m afraid to go back to eating carbs because I don\u2019t want to get fat \u2013 what should I do?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m posting this email because this is more typical than people think.\n\nWhat Happens When You Start Keto Diet?\n\nPeople who exercise and want to get in shape, follow a ketogenic diet and are very excited at first. They get to eat bacon and lots of fat and other \u201cforbidden\u201d foods.\n\nThey start to lose \u201cweight\u201d immediately and actually feel a bit euphoric and happy because their brain is using ketones and not glucose.\n\nHowever, what they don\u2019t realize is that the initial weight loss is just water loss because you\u2019re not eating carbs. Carbohydrates hold 3x their weight in water.\n\nSo within a week, you LOOK leaner and the scale \u201cproves\u201d it, because of the water loss. But, it\u2019s fake.\n\nYes, you do burn fat following a keto diet \u2013 but if you\u2019re natural and don\u2019t take steroids, your testosterone will drop and so will your thyroid levels. To make things worse, your stress hormone Cortisol shoots up.\n\nThis means you start to lose muscle at a faster rate than fat loss.\n\nAnd over the next few weeks and months, your metabolism starts to really slow down because of these negative hormonal changes.\n\nPeople are so afraid of insulin and don\u2019t want it high \u2013 but they don\u2019t take into account all of the other hormones.\n\nNow, some of these so-called \u201cexperts\u201d will argue and say \u201cbut keto diets increase Growth Hormone\u201d. Yes, maybe temporarily and they also increase prolactin, a female hormone.\n\nBut GH does nothing unless it converts to IGF (insulin-like growth factor) and THAT requires insulin and thyroid, BOTH of which are low on a keto diet.\n\nThus, the higher GH is worthless because it doesn\u2019t convert much to the real muscle builder, IGF.\n\nAnd yes, the minute you add carbs back into your diet, you blow up and get fat because your body is not used to the sugar, your testosterone and thyroid levels are much lower and your stress hormone Cortisol is much higher.\n\nALL things you don\u2019t want.\n\nBy the way, these negative effects are worse for women, and they last longer as well. It really screws things up for women and it\u2019s harder to fix things for them.\n\nSo if you want to follow a keto diet, just do it short-term\u2026 no more than 2-3 weeks, and then go back to a higher carb diet.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to go to extremes to into shape and I think a keto diet is extreme.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to get off of a keto diet, slowly add carbs back to your diet so you don\u2019t \u201cblow up\u201d. It\u2019ll give a chance for your hormones to slowly adjust without the shock and thus, the fat gain.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal the real cause and the #1 reason guys get \u201cman boobs\u201d, also known as Gynecomastia (gyno).\n\nI bring this up because I get a lot of questions about this topic and to be honest with you, I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nIn fact, statistics show that this \u201cmedical condition\u201d, is on the rise. Over the past 3 decades, gynecomastia has increased by 57%1 \u2013 which is crazy if you think about it.\n\nSo if you have \u201cgyno\u201d \u2013 regardless of how small or big \u2013 you\u2019re not alone because having gynecomastia is actually quite common these days.\n\nAbout 60% of boys get it during puberty 2\n\n37% of men in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s have it 2\n\nand a whopping 70% of men age 50 and older have it.2\n\nWhat\u2019s The Real Cause Of Gynecomastia?\n\nNow, most people think the real cause is high estrogen. Yes, estrogen is definitely a major problem\u2026\n\nHowever, the REAL cause is actually having low testosterone and more specifically, an imbalance in hormones \u2013 primarily between testosterone AND estrogen. Thus, the \u201cratio\u201d is more in favor of estrogens, than testosterone.\n\nFor example, you can have low estrogen and still get gynecomastia, IF your testosterone is ALSO low. So ideally you want HIGH testosterone and LOW estrogen.\n\nGuys with gyno actually have the opposite, LOW testosterone and HIGH estrogen \u2013 the ratio is backward.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things get interesting and actually, really bad for guys who have man-boobs.\n\nSo read carefully\u2026 As your estrogen levels increase, your body tells your testicles to produce LESS testosterone.\n\nSo, that\u2019s bad news #1\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that the body\u2019s natural estrogen inhibitor,\u2026 the way your body tries to naturally lower estrogen internally, \u2026. is by increasing the hormone \u2013 Dihydrotestosterone, also known as DHT\u2026\n\nWhich is a primary cause of balding and excess body hair (back, shoulders, etc.)!!! That\u2019s bad news #2\n\nSo guys with gyno have:\n\nMore estrogen \u2013 more body fat, depression, etc.\n\nLess testosterone \u2013 smaller muscle, lower sex drive, etc.\n\nHigher DHT \u2013 balding, body hair, etc.\n\nThe Bed News Continue\n\nBecause there\u2019s another major hormonal imbalance typically seen with \u201cman-boob\u201d guys \u2014 higher levels of the stress hormone, Cortisol\n\n\u2026 which further DECREASES testosterone levels, even more, causing an even HIGHER ratio of estrogen, so on and so forth.\n\nSo the bad news keeps getting worse.\n\nThe negative hormonal imbalances cause even bigger imbalances as you age and also as you get fatter,\u2026 which is further enhanced BY the hormonal imbalances.\n\nSimply stated, you\u2019re kinda \u201cscrewed\u201d.\n\nWhich explains why it\u2019s so much harder for you to\n\ngain muscle or lose fat \u2026\n\nand why your sex drive keeps going lower \u2026\n\nand you lose more and more muscle every year.\n\nAnd basically, you aging and getting older, at a FASTER rate.\n\nSo listen\u2026 I can go on and on about this topic because it also causes higher cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, erectile problems, etc., etc.\n\nBut by now I hope you get the point.\n\nSo, let\u2019s QUICKLY talk about solutions.\n\nSome people need to have surgery to remove the gyno. This is fine, especially if yours is big. Make sure you find an EXPERIENCED doctor who has done this surgery dozens and hundreds of times.\n\nHowever, regardless of the surgery, you still MUST improve your hormonal imbalance \u2013 which includes 3-4 solutions:\n\nReduce Estrogen/Female Hormones\n\nFirst, you need to reduce your estrogen levels. This is done by\n\nThis is because fat cells increase estrogen levels.\n\nLots of foods increase estrogen \u2014 such as soy products and animal protein, primarily because of all the hormones in the foods. For example, chick eat soy products and that gets into the chicken and then into you \u2014 even the \u201corganic, free-range\u201d junk\n\nSo you need to eat more vegetables and healthy fats \u2013 such as coconut, nuts, seeds, avocados and so forth.\n\nIncrease Testosterone\n\nOnce you\u2019ve lowered your estrogens and female hormones, we need to focus on increasing your testosterone.\n\nAs you\u2019ve read in my other articles, you need to lift weights. And you only need to do this 3-4x weekly and no more than an hour each session.\n\nRunning, jogging, long-distance biking and hiking all increase stress hormones and decrease testosterone. Keep your intense cardio sessions short, to less than 15-20 minutes. Or best of all, simply go for a brisk, 30 min walk 3-5x weekly.\n\nAnd as stated above, eating more fats \u2013 especially saturated fats such as eggs are great. And don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t increase your cholesterol levels. 2-3 eggs, 2-3x weekly \u2013 pasteurized eggs are best.\n\nAlso, make sure you sleep better. Go to bed before midnight, and sleep at least 6-7 hours. Most of your hormones are made during sleep and most people are, unfortunately, sleep deprived.\n\nTake Specific, Clinically Proven, \u201cHormone Balancing\u201d Supplements\n\nImproving your lifestyle is very important, but it does take time to see results \u2026 so please be patient.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re in a rush to see improvements \u2026 especially if you\u2019re over the age of 35, I highly suggest every man to take specific herbs, plant extracts, vitamins, minerals and amino acids that are clinically proven to:\n\nincrease your testosterone\n\nLower stress hormones such as cortisol\n\nand thus, create optimal hormonal balance.\n\nThe reality is that most of us are deficient in specific ingredients and we just can\u2019t get enough of it in our foods.\n\nThis is why the correct supplements will make the biggest and fastest improvement in your hormones and thus, decreasing the size of your gyno and helping eliminate any problems in the future.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770912\n\nhttp://www.rightdiagnosis.com/g/gynecomastia/stats.htm",

This Peruvian plant only grows in the most inhospitable parts of the Andes, yet it\u2019s becoming popular worldwide, as an aphrodisiac and fertility booster.\n\nMaca has a long history of use as an aphrodisiac in both men and women.\n\nIt\u2019s not fully understood how maca works in this regard because Maca does not contain plant hormones and does not work by increasing levels of sex hormones like testosterone or estrogen, directly.\n\nHowever, Maca may work by normalizing steroid sex hormones like testosterone, progesterone, and estrogen.\n\nThus, it improves the RATIOS between your sex hormones.\n\nHowever, chemical research has demonstrated that Maca Root contains a chemical (p-methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate), which has \u201caphrodisiac\u201d properties.\n\nMaca For Men And Women\n\nIn men, it is believed to help treat male impotence and erectile dysfunction and may, in fact, increase seminal volume and sperm motility.\n\nIn women, it is said to increase libido, perk up a low sex drive, and may, because of the herb\u2019s glucosinolate content, enhance fertility.\n\nIn a double-blind 2002 study, researchers gave 57 men maca EXTRACT or placebo (sugar pill). The men received the supplements daily for 12 weeks. After 8 weeks, men in the maca groups reported heightened sexual desire [1].\n\nAnother study looked at 20 depressed men on SSRIs \u2013 antidepressants that often decrease sex drive \u2013 and found that daily maca extract \u201csignificantly increased self-reported libido\u201d. A similar study looking at 45 women on antidepressants found maca had the same effect [3]. And some have even called Maca \u201cnature\u2019s answer to Viagra\u201d.\n\nNow, I wouldn\u2019t go that far.\n\nCorrect Form And Dosage\n\nHowever, Maca does work, IF you use the correct form and dosage.\n\nFirst of all, if you\u2019re using the \u201croot powder\u201d, you\u2019ll need at least 3000-5000 MGS daily. The \u201croot\u201d powder is never as potent or as effective as the extract form.\n\nSo, your goal should be to get Maca EXTRACT, preferably at 6%\u2026 Which contains the beneficial chemicals (p-methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate and glucosinolate) causing an improvement in hormonal balance and an increase in sex drive.\n\nAdditionally, research has shown that Maca Extract works much better when combined with other complementary and synergistic herbs and vitamins, such as\n\nFenugreek, Tongkat Ali, Avena Sativa, Stinging Nettle, and Tribulus extract, for optimal testosterone levels.\n\nDIM and Selenium to reduce the female hormone, estrogen\n\nVitamin C and Ashwagandha reduce the stress hormone, cortisol\n\nVitex Agnus to reduce the female hormone, prolactin\n\nZinc to reduce the hair loss and prostate problems hormone, DHT\n\nThe special synergy between these correct \u201cstack of ingredients\u201d, creates a much safer and more effective solution.\n\nIt\u2019s like 1+1+1 = 6 (not 3!)\n\nYou use less, and you get more.\n\nThe \u201cstack\u201d saves you money and gives you better, safer results, for a longer amount of time.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve simplified all of this for you.\n\nHere is a link to the exact formula you can use and my favorite natural solutions that I personally use for boosting testosterone levels and increasing libido.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12472620\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18801111\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25954318\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19781622\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11753476\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19260845",

And the secret is getting into deep REM sleep (rapid eye movement).\n\nHowever, going to bed at the wrong times, eating the wrong foods or drinks, and not having specific vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids will screw up your REM sleep and testosterone production.\n\nAnd in regards to how much sleep you need for optimal testosterone levels\u2026 studies have shown that men who sleep 4-5 hours on average have 60% to 120% LESS testosterone than men who average 8-9 hours.1,2\n\nThat means by sleeping an extra 3-4 hours, you can literally double your testosterone AND decrease your cortisol levels at the same time.\n\n7 Clinically Proven Ways To Get Better & Deeper Sleep\n\nOkay, so let me quickly show you how to instantly get better and deeper sleep, so you can possibly double your testosterone levels.4\n\nGo to bed before midnight. You should actually go to bed around 9:30-10 pm because that\u2019s your body\u2019s natural circadian rhythm, which produces lower cortisol and higher testosterone. If that\u2019s too early, at least get to bed before midnight.\n\nWear blue-blocker glasses. Bright light and blue light from electronic devices prevent your body from producing melatonin. So dim the lights around your home and wear these orange, blue-blocker glasses an hour or two before bed.\n\nEat a small, higher-fat meal. One reason your body wakes up in the middle of the night is due to low blood sugar. About an hour or two before bed, have about 200 calories of some kind of protein, healthy fat, and a little bit of fruit to prevent blood sugar issues.\n\nNo electronic devices in your bedroom. No wi-fi, cell phones, etc. because the electromagnetic field disrupts sleep quality and brain function.3 If you need an alarm, use a regular alarm clock if possible or use your cell phone, but put it on \u201cairplane\u201d mode.\n\nSleep in a cold room with no underwear. As your body cools down, you produce more melatonin, the sleep hormone. And your testicles need to be a little cooler than your body temperature to produce optimal testosterone \u2013 that\u2019s why no underwear.\n\nSleep in complete darkness. This means no light, no clock, no nightlight, or anything. Have blackout curtains and wear eyeshades if you can\u2019t make this happen.\n\nAvoid alcohol, caffeine or any stimulants if you can. And don\u2019t exercise too late in the day because that also \u201cstimulates\u201d your nervous system.\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 sleep better and more to increase your testosterone levels.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17520786\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19684340\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15195201\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3955336",

This is when women in their late 40s stop menstruating due to a drop in their hormones.\n\nAt this point, women start having hot flashes, difficulty sleeping, loss of sex drive, fatigue, hair loss, anxiety, weight gain in the belly, etc., etc.\n\nWell, the same thing happens in men, but it\u2019s very gradual and it starts in your late 20\u2019s.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a major difference. For women, it happens suddenly and thus, the symptoms are very intense!\n\nBut men, it just creeps up on us gradually. Little by little, you start to lose your \u201cmanhood\u201d due to a drop in your primary MALE sex hormones, such as TESTOSTERONE.\n\nNow you\u2019re losing your libido, you have smaller muscles, hair loss, not \u201cdriven\u201d or motivated, etc.\n\nTo make matters worse, your FEMALE hormones such as estrogen begin to INCREASE!\n\nNow you start to get more emotional, depressed, and moody, get fatter, and maybe even get \u201cman boobs\u201d.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not bad enough, as your testosterone levels DECREASE, your \u201cstress\u201d hormones, such as Cortisol, begin to INCREASE!\n\nNow you have more belly fat, anxiety, feeling stressed and agitated, higher cholesterol and blood sugar levels, more aches, and pains, etc., etc.\n\nIt\u2019s a big mess and this is why getting older sucks!\n\nNatural Part Of Aging?\n\nNow, some people will say \u201chey, this is just a part of \u201cnatural\u201d AGING\u2026 who cares. You can\u2019t always look and feel young\u2026 Just accept it.\u201d Well, yes\u2026 to a certain degree.\n\nExcept for that andropause and the drop in testosterone is happening WAY sooner, faster and harder in men today, than at any time in history!!!\n\nTwo major studies shows1,2 showed that men\u2019s testosterone levels had dropped by 22% between 1987 and 2004 \u2013 that only 17 years.\n\nAnother study3 showed that during the past 100 years, there\u2019s been an estimated 57% drop in testosterone!!!\n\nYes, testosterone levels may \u201cnaturally\u201d drop as we get older, but THIS is not natural.\n\nModern society of more stress, electronics, lack of nutrients in our foods, more medications, and dozens of other reasons is causing an ABNORMAL drop in your male hormones and an increase in female and stress hormones.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Solution?\n\nSo, what options do we have? How can we fix this?\n\nWell, I want to give you something for you to take action on today, so you can see and feel improvements in your testosterone, quickly.\n\nTop 10 Testosterone Boosting Solutions \u2013 Quick Summary\n\nHere\u2019s a quick summary of natural ways you can increase your testosterone and sex drive.\n\nLift heavy weights, 6-10 reps. 3-4x weekly. NO more than 60 minutes. This increases testosterone.\n\nDo NO cardio \u2013 running, jogging, biking, etc. It increases your stress hormone, cortisol. Only form of \u201ccardio\u201d is a brisk 30-40 min walk, 3-4x weekly\n\nReduce your simple carbs. No sugars or fructose.\n\nEat more healthy fats, at least 30% of your diet \u2013 especially eggs, including the yolk and raw coconut oil. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t cause \u201chigh\u201d cholesterol. But it will increase your testosterone.\n\nAvoid dairy and soy \u2013 both will increase your female hormones.\n\nAvoid meats that aren\u2019t organic and raised on an open pasture. Almost all red meats are full of hormones that increase your female hormones.\n\nEliminate all \u201cfake\u201d processed foods that come in a \u201cbox\u201d. They\u2019re full of additives that castrate you.\n\nReduce or eliminate medications, alcohol, smoking, marijuana, \u201cuppers\u201d and most drugs. They all reduce testosterone levels.\n\nGet more rest and sleep. Try to go to bed around 10 pm or for sure before midnight. More \u201ctestosterone\u201d boosting hormones get produced.\n\nTake natural herbs, vitamins, and minerals that are proven to improve your hormones \u2013 magnesium, zinc, D3, Selenium, Fenugreek Extract, Avena Sativa, and Tribulus.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do all 10 right now, but at least start with one today and do more over time.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://jcem.endojournals.org/content/92/1/196.abstract\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17895324\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2713758/The-changing-face-humans-Researchers-say-drop-testosterone-levels-50-000-years-ago-triggered-era-operation-gave-mankind-art-technology.html",

    "content": "If you\u2019re thinking about increasing your testosterone levels so you can look and feel younger, make sure you pay attention today because most people are doing it incorrectly and are having the opposite, negative effects.\n\nI think most people, especially guys know what testosterone is. Simply stated, for men, testosterone is the KING of all hormones. It\u2019s what turns boys into men and what keeps a man young, strong, and \u201cdriven\u201d.\n\nTestosterone has many benefits. It helps:\n\nBuild muscle and strength, including your heart muscle and stronger bones\n\nDecrease body fat, especially the unhealthy belly fat and \u201clove handles\u201d\n\nImproves your mood and mental wellbeing\n\nDecreases your risk for heart and blood sugar regulation problems\n\nImproves cognition and memory\n\nAnd YES, it increases your libido, and sex drive and improves erections.\n\nHowever, as we age our testosterone levels begin to drop, starting in your mid 20\u2019s2\n\nThese days, due to the pollutants in our foods, water, and environment, radiation from electronic devices, and the extra stress of modern society, men have much lower testosterone than they did 50 or even 25 years ago.2\n\nBy age 40, most men are producing on average about 20% less testosterone and it gets much worse in your 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s1,2\n\nSo if you\u2019re not feeling and looking the way you want to, it may not be your fault \u2013 it could be low testosterone.\n\nDo You Have \u201cAndropause\u201d?\n\nAnd the media, doctors, and the world have finally acknowledged this \u201cproblem\u201d and have, in fact, labeled it as \u201candropause\u201d \u2026 similar to \u201caging\u201d women and menopause.\n\nSo, these days many guys have heard of the term \u201cLow T\u201d, which stands for low testosterone.\n\nAnd because of this, lots of guys are wanting to improve their testosterone levels, which is a good thing, IF you know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nUnfortunately, most people \u2014 including doctors, do NOT know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nFor example, I\u2019ve got guys coming to me all the time asking about taking testosterone injections, pills, and similar \u201csteroid\u201d drugs for \u201cHormone Replacement Therapy\u201d (HRT)\n\nSo I tell them, what I\u2019m going to share with you today\u2026 If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing \u2014 and most people don\u2019t, including doctors\u2026\n\nThe Problem With Testosterone Replacement Therapy\n\nThen all the \u201cbenefits\u201d of testosterone that I mentioned earlier, can actually turn into the opposite \u2014 many NEGATIVES such as\n\nMore body fat, especially belly\n\nMoodiness, anger, and/or depression.\n\nIncrease rate of cancer, both prostate, and breast (YES, guys get breast cancer too!)\n\nHigher levels of insulin, cholesterol, less blood flow, cardiac problems, etc.\n\nAnd over time, it can even cause impotence.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing this very important topic with you today I want you to learn from other people\u2019s mistakes.\n\nWhy Should You Even Listen To Me?\n\nNow, before I get into the \u201cwhy\u201d and the \u201csolutions\u201d to prevent these negative side effects, I want you to know that this is my area of expertise for over 20+ years.\n\nI\u2019m an anti-aging, endocrinology doctor \u2014 which is the \u201cstudy of hormones\u201d. I\u2019ve always been interested in how the mind and body work.\n\nI\u2019ve especially been fascinated with hormones because the way you look and feel is based on your genetics and more importantly, your HORMONES!\n\nChange your hormones and related \u201cmodulators\u201d and enzymes, and I can most definitely change the way you look, feel, act and even think!\n\nSo with that said, how can the \u201cking of all hormones\u201d and all of its benefits, ALSO be so negative?\n\nThe REAL Cause Of Low Testosterone\n\nThe problem stems from the \u201ccause\u201d of your declining testosterone as you age. I\u2019m going to keep it really simple and reduce the boring medical jargon.\n\nSo here\u2019s how your body works\u2026 As you get older, due to genetics, environmental factors, diet, bodyfat, stress levels, etc. \u2026 your estrogen levels INCREASE.\n\nAs estrogen and other female hormones (progesterone, prolactin, etc.) increase, your testosterone DECREASES.\n\nThis change in your estrogen levels also increases \u201cSex hormone-binding Globulin\u201d (SHBG), which further DECREASES your to total testosterone and more importantly, your \u201cfree testosterone\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019re \u201cfree\u201d testosterone is the good stuff that does most of the work. Think of \u201ctotal\u201d testosterone as your \u201cgross income\u201d, and \u201cfree\u201d testosterone as your NET income\u2026 The money you get to keep and spend AFTER expenses, taxes, etc.\n\nAlso, as you get older, most men convert more testosterone to a hormone called \u201cDihydrotestosterone\u201d, also known as DHT\n\nThis is the hormone that causes hair loss, body hair growth in all the wrong places and also, and prostate problems\n\nFinally, with the extra stress in our modern lives, you have higher levels of adrenal stress hormones, such as Cortisol.\n\nMost people make the mistake and think that the opposite of testosterone is the female hormone estrogen, but it\u2019s NOT \u2014 It\u2019s the stress hormone Cortisol!\n\nAs this stress hormone goes up, your testosterone decreases even further! So what the heck does all of this mean for you?!!\u2026\n\nSo What Does All Of This Mean For You?\n\nIF you take testosterone hormones (injections, pills, etc.), especially after the age of 30 and certainly 40 and beyond, your testosterone will initially go up \u2026.\n\nBut then it\u2019ll come back down because the testosterone will convert to MORE estrogen\u2026 which means more fat, depression, potential breast problems and impotence for you.\n\n\u2026 AND, the testosterone will also convert to more DHT, which means more body hair, accelerated hair loss and increased risk of prostate problems.\n\nSo now you have higher \u201cnegative\u201d hormones of estrogens and DHT. LESS \u201cpositive\u201d total and \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels.\n\nAnd guess what, the lower your testosterone, the HIGHER your stress hormone, cortisol!\n\nYou\u2019re Now \u201cScrewed\u201d!\n\nSimply stated, you\u2019re now screwed because of having\n\nMore estrogen (fat, depression, man-boobs)\n\nMore DHT (hair problems, prostate problems)\n\nMore Cortisol (stress, belly fat)\n\nLESS total and \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels (less muscle, strength, sex drive)\n\nTo make things even worse, your testicles and other \u201cmuscles\u201d will shrink! Now you\u2019re really screwed! \u2026. So, what does all of this mean?\n\nYou and/or your doctor have to understand all of the different hormonal pathways, enzymatic conversions and potential side effects. This requires monthly blood work and typically, the use of various medications to help prevent the negatives.\n\nThis is a LOT of work and money\u2026. And most doctors don\u2019t know or care to know about all of these details.\n\nForget The Drugs, Here\u2019s How To Do It Naturally\n\nMy suggestion is that BEFORE you start taking \u201cexogenous\u201d (external) testosterone (injections, pills, creams, etc.), try to increase your testosterone levels NATURALLY, from within!\n\nThe benefit is you won\u2019t have the negative side effects\u2026 or the increased risk for health problems.\n\nYou also won\u2019t be dealing with the emotional and physical roller coaster. Plus you get to KEEP all the benefits because it\u2019s natural, not artificially induced.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I want to discuss the top 10 \u201csex-drive\u201d killers\u2026\n\nAs you get older, your sex drive tends to decrease \u2013 this is especially true for men. At the end of today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll give you one of the best solutions for naturally increasing your sex drive, regardless of your age. However, just as important as \u2018increasing\u2019 your drive, is to stop or reduce these top 10 \u201csex-drive\u201d killers.\n\nWhen you\u2019re under stress \u2013 mentally, physically, and/or emotionally \u2013 you don\u2019t really feel \u201csexy\u201d. Your mind is more focused on the \u201cproblem\u201d and it\u2019s hard to get out of your head. But more so, the real problem with stress is NEGATIVE changes in your hormones.\n\nAs your stress hormone cortisol goes up, your primary \u201csex drive\u201d hormone, Testosterone goes DOWN! Many people think the opposite of testosterone is estrogen, but it\u2019s not.\n\nIt\u2019s the stress hormone, Cortisol By the way, BOTH men and women have these same hormones, but just in different amounts and ratios.\n\nNeedless to say, when your body is under stress and you have these negative hormonal changes, it\u2019s \u201cnature\u2019s\u201d way of turning OFF your sex drive because it\u2019s not the right time to procreate \u2013 which is the primary reason for having sex in nature.\n\nBased on thousands of years of evolution, your body thinks \u201chey, you\u2019re under a lot of stress\u2026 maybe there isn\u2019t enough food or shelter, I better turn OFF your libido so you don\u2019t have intercourse and try to have a baby \u2014 it\u2019s not a good time\u201d\n\nSo you must learn to manage your stress levels because this is a major \u201csex drive\u201d killer, due to the negative changes in your hormones!\n\n2 \u2013 Partner/Relationship Problems\n\nProblems with your partner are one of the top sex-drive killers. This can fall into the \u201cstress\u201d category as well, but this would be more of emotional stress.\n\nThis typically affects women even more because for women, feeling close is a major part of \u201cdesire\u201d. They start to get aroused more in their mind and heart, while men do so visually with their eyes.\n\nHowever, \u201cstress\u201d from fighting, poor communication, negative feelings of resentment, betrayal, anger, and other trust issues all negatively affect your sexual desire for your partner.\n\nJust know that this person that you\u2019re intimate with, does NOT come from a place of ill intent. They may say the wrong things at times because they feel angry, insecure, not loved and so forth \u2014 but you need to sit down and put your pride aside and start communicating again.\n\nRemember, if you treat the person you\u2019re with the way you did in the BEGINNING, there will not be an \u201cend\u201d! Something to think about \u2026\n\nOne or two drinks may make you feel more open to sex by reducing your inhibitions. But too much alcohol will do the opposite, especially in men.\n\nThis is because alcohol increases estrogen levels, which then lowers testosterone \u2013 your primary sex-drive hormone.\n\nBy the way, this is true for many drugs \u2013 marijuana being one of them as well. So do your best to limit your alcohol to maybe 1 or 2 drinks.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sleeping enough or not sleeping well, chances are you\u2019re tired. And if you\u2019re tired all the time, you\u2019re not going to want to have sex\u2026 especially after a long work day, dealing with life, kids, and all the other problems we deal with.\n\nAnother major issue with not sleeping enough is again, the negative change in your hormones. Low sleep increases your stress hormone, Cortisol. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, high cortisol LOWERS your testosterone.\n\nSo do your best to get to bed earlier or take a nap if you can during the day. More sleep is good for your sex drive and overall health.\n\nHaving kids lowers your sex drive in multiple ways.\n\nA \u2013 you\u2019re tired from lack of sleep B \u2013 more stress (worry, money, etc.) C \u2013 less TIME to have sex because of the kids\n\nYou can\u2019t get rid of the kids, but you can try to squeeze in a \u201cdate\u201d night once a week if you can. Kids are a priority but don\u2019t neglect your spouse in all of this\n\nYou\u2019d be surprised, but MOST medications cause a DECREASE in your sex drive.\n\nThis is because of negative changes in your hormones, as well as the extra stress on your body and organs (liver, kidney, etc.)\n\nThat\u2019s why I always suggest taking natural herbs and vitamins, rather than prescription drugs.\n\n7 \u2013 Feeling insecure about your body\n\nFeeling sexy is easier if you like how you look. Some things about the way you look you can change, some you can\u2019t.\n\nThose that you can\u2019t, you must learn to accept it. No point in focusing on or worrying about something you can\u2019t change\u2026 right?\n\nBetter to put effort into improving the parts of your body that you\u2019re not super happy about, but that you CAN change and improve.\n\nIf you want to lose a few pounds or gain some muscle, put in the time and effort and make it happen.\n\nWe both know that getting older is only going to make things harder. So get started NOW and just do something physical and focus on improving what you CAN, rather than what\u2019s out of your control.\n\nBeing depressed can shut off your ability to have pleasure in many things, especially sex.\n\nWhen you\u2019re depressed, you don\u2019t look forward to anything, and \u201cbeing sexual\u201d can be one of those.\n\nSadly, taking prescription antidepressants turns OFF your sex drive even more because of the negative changes in your hormones caused by these toxic drugs.\n\nExercise can definitely change and improve your hormones, helping reduce depression. So can taking certain herbs and vitamins, which I\u2019ll tell you more about in a second.\n\n9 & 10 \u2013 Hormonal Changes\n\nFinally, the biggest \u201csex-drive killer\u201d of all is the change in your hormones\u2026 typically due to aging.\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman, going through menopause will definitely cause a decrease in your sex drive. And this is because of an imbalance in your hormones (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, etc.)\n\nNot only will you lose your mental and physical \u201cdrive\u201d, but also the vaginal dryness and pain during sex will further cause most women to be \u201cturned off\u201d with the thought of sex.\n\nAs women go through menopause, men go through something similar called, \u201candropause\u201d.\n\nThis again is a negative change in your hormones due to aging. And this is mainly caused due to a DECREASE in your primary \u201csex drive hormone\u201d called, testosterone. By the way, women also have lowered testosterone during menopause.\n\nThe other issue for men is an increase in the female hormone, estrogen. So again, an imbalance in your hormones.\n\nOver and over again you\u2019ll notice that the primary cause of low libido, is the negative change in your hormones.\n\nFor men, this is gradual but starts as early as the mid-\u201920s\n\nFor women, this tends to happen quickly due to menopause.\n\nNeedless to say, if you want to improve your physical and mental well-being while increasing your sex drive and looking and feeling younger, you MUST improve your youth hormones.\n\nI have great video about this topic and my favorite solution for improving your youthful, sex-drive hormones.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "If you\u2019re thinking about TRT and concerned about your prostate, keep reading\u2026\n\n\u201cDr. Robbins \u2013 I did a blood test recently and my testosterone levels were on the low side. My total testosterone was 320, with the range being 250-960. My doctor suggested I get on testosterone replacement therapy. I\u2019m 62 years old. I obviously feel that higher testosterone levels would be a good idea. But I\u2019m worried about prostate growth and cancer. My father died of prostate cancer and there are prostate problems on my mother\u2019s side as well with her brother. What do you suggest since you\u2019re the hormone specialist? As much as I want higher testosterone, I obviously don\u2019t want prostate problems.\u201d\n\nYes, this is a real debate these days and one that I remember having almost 20 years ago with a Urologist and this was back in the day when TRT and all of this stuff was rarely prescribed like it is these days.\n\nHormone Replacement Therapies\n\nThese days, many people go to these hormone replacement clinics and get all sorts of drugs\u2026 Testosterone, growth hormone, various blockers for estrogen, DHT and so forth.\n\nIt\u2019s a very big and lucrative business.\n\nIn your specific case, yes \u2013 it looks like you do have somewhat \u201clow\u201d testosterone, even though it\u2019s still in the normal range.\n\nOf course, how you feel matters as well \u2013 low libido, drive, muscle loss, belly fat, negative mood, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, you didn\u2019t say what your free testosterone levels are. What are your various female hormones are \u2013 such as estradiol and prolactin. Or your DHT (dihydrotestosterone) levels or PSA score for your prostate. Or, what about adrenal hormones such as DHEA and cortisol.\n\nAll of these hormones (and a few others) will easily affect your total testosterone, which is just ONE indicator of healthy hormone levels.\n\nA good doctor would have tested all of these hormones before ever telling you to take testosterone.\n\nBut again, it\u2019s a big, lucrative, money-making business.\n\nSo, in this case, I can\u2019t just blindly give you an answer.\n\nMy Experience With Hormone Replacement\n\nAbout 10 years ago my friend\u2019s dad was given testosterone by his doctor because his levels were low.\n\nHe was 72 years old. In decent shape. Fairly healthy. So, the first couple of weeks he felt great. But by the end of the month, he started having some side effects.\n\nBy the end of the second month, he started losing his head hair. Mind you, at age 72 he had almost a full head of hair. So, I figured he had great hair genetics, and yet, the testosterone therapy triggered something.\n\nBy the third month, he noticed he had lots of urinating problems and his PSA score had almost doubled and hence, prostate growth.\n\nThe testosterone did give him more energy and feel better, but he got off the testosterone because the balding and prostate problems just weren\u2019t worth it for him.\n\nMy point with this story is you never know how YOUR body will react.\n\nHowever, having a family history of prostate problems or growth, such as BPH and prostate cancer is obviously a potential \u201cwarning\u201d sign that you rightly should be concerned about.\n\nAfter all, prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men.\n\nActually, lung cancer is \u2013 but that\u2019s 95% related to smoking, which is obviously self-inflicted.\n\nNow, looking over many clinical studies for TRT and prostate outcomes, the conclusion is that researchers do NOT know \u2013 especially regarding the long-term use of testosterone and prostate health.\n\nIF you do have prostate cancer, it\u2019s obviously NOT recommended that you take testosterone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not mainly because testosterone is the problem \u2013 but because of its younger brother and sister, which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute.\n\nNow, some studies show that testosterone accelerates prostate cancer and some studies show it can actually help advanced prostate cancer in some men.\n\nSome studies show testosterone therapy can cause prostate growth and higher PSA levels and some studies show no correlation.\n\nSo again, mixed outcomes.\n\nHowever, one thing is for sure \u2013 there are no long-term studies that give any definitive answers.\n\nIs Testosterone The Cause Of Prostate Problems?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think it is or else young men would have prostate problems since that\u2019s the peak of your testosterone levels.\n\nYET, older men who have lower testosterone have prostate problems.\n\nEven though the prostate does grow simply due to aging \u2013 there are other hormones that can contribute to prostate problems and it\u2019s been clinically validated.\n\nHormones such as estrogens, DHT, cortisol, IGF, insulin, and others.\n\nNow, what happens when you take testosterone \u2013 injections or creams? Well, it can easily convert to estrogens and DHT.\n\nBOTH of which are known to cause cancer and prostate problems.\n\nAnd this is why I said earlier with \u201ctestosterone younger sister and brother\u201d are the real problems.\n\nReal Picture Of Things Work\u2026\n\nA doctor or HRT clinic will give you testosterone. And usually, not the correct dose. Many times too high a dose.\n\nBeing older, having more body fat, and so forth, you end up converting the testosterone a lot more to estrogens and DHT.\n\nNow you are having side effects, potential gynecomastia (man boobs), and yes, prostate problems.\n\nSo then the doctor or HRT clinic will proscribe you estrogen and DHT inhibitors, such as Arimidex and Proscar or their generic versions.\n\nNow the estrogen and DHT come down, but it\u2019s too low since these drugs are very powerful.\n\nAnd now you\u2019re having libido problems since estrogen and DHT affect sex drive.\n\nIn addition to more stress on your heart and brain since these hormones are neuro and cardioprotective when they are in a healthy range.\n\nSo what happens \u2013 well, now you need to start playing around with the various drugs and dosages to get everything to be just right for YOUR body and YOUR genetics.\n\nThis requires lots of office visits and blood tests.\n\nAll of this means LOTS of money out of your pocket and into the Doctor\u2019s bank account.\n\nLet me make it very clear, I would say 99% of doctors and HRT clinics will NEVER do any of these important things specific for YOUR and YOUR body and genetics.\n\nIt takes too much time and knowledge.\n\nThey\u2019ll give you a cookie-cutter drug dosage and that\u2019s it.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t perform sexually because these hormones aren\u2019t optimized correctly, then they\u2019ll give you Viagra or Cialis \u2026 more drugs.\n\nEventually, after a few months or maybe a year or two, most men just give up due to all the hassle, pills, and costs.\n\nBut guess what, now your testicles are completely shut down and nothing works since you were taking testosterone.\n\nSo you\u2019re worst than when you first started.\n\nHow do I know all of this? Because I\u2019ve dealt with so many guys over years with these same horror stories.\n\nHormones and drugs are very powerful and you better know a very smart and caring doctor to help you.\n\nIf you can find one, great.\n\nIf you can\u2019t, I suggest you do it naturally FIRST before you go the TRT drug route because once you start, it\u2019s really hard to stop.\n\nTRT can be very valuable when done correctly.\n\nBut first, try to raise your testosterone levels and optimize your hormones, naturally.\n\nYou won\u2019t have any of the negative side effects. It\u2019ll be good for prostate health, in addition to your libido and sexual performance.\n\nDoing it naturally is something you can do for the rest of your life and it\u2019ll improve your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nFirst, fix what\u2019s causing the low testosterone.\n\nBe consistent and patient, it takes time.\n\nBut if you still have issues a year later and your testosterone is low, THEN go find a really smart and caring doctor to help you with TRT specific for YOUR body and genetics.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/can-exercise-really-increase-testosterone-levels/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal\n\nWhich exercises increase and decrease testosterone levels.\n\nThe best ones to do, reps, rest periods, etc.\n\nWhat to do & take before and after your workouts to maximize & optimize your hormones.\n\nOne of my girlfriends used to lift weights, on and off. She would do so for a few months and then stop for whatever reason and then do cardio workouts or spin classes\u2026 then maybe yoga or pilates, and so forth.\n\nBut here\u2019s the interesting thing \u2013 when she lifted weights, she said she was always very horny and had a much higher sex drive, especially right after the gym for about an hour or so.\n\nHowever, none of the other forms of exercise boosted her libido, or not nearly as much. In fact, she said too much cardio actually lowered her sex drive after a while.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that I also noticed she had more body odor when she was lifting weights.\n\nNow, I never did blood tests on her \u2013 but, based on what we both observed, lifting weights must have caused an increase in her testosterone levels because she had a much higher sex drive AND she had more body odor.\n\nAnd yes, testosterone, DHT, and estrogen \u2013 which would all increase together, can cause an increase in body odor.\n\nSo, What Does This Mean For You?\n\nWell, if go through all the various CLINICAL studies, it does show that exercise can increase testosterone levels \u2013 at least, temporarily.\n\nThis includes men and women, young and old.\n\nOf course, some studies show that it does nothing or very little, especially for women.\n\nResearch has also shown that lifting weights is the best form of exercise for boosting testosterone levels. While long-form, stressful cardio, can actually decrease testosterone levels over time.\n\nSo, you may think \u2013 \u201cgreat, I\u2019m going to lift weights \u2013 what\u2019s the best workout?\u201d\n\nBased on the research, using heavy compound exercises, such as squats, deadlifts, and presses are the best.\n\nDoing lower 5-10 rep sets, at about 80-95% of your max is ideal.\n\nHowever, looking deeper into the studies, the reason these heavy, compound exercise workouts cause the biggest boost in testosterone levels, is because they also tend to have the biggest increase in stress hormones such as cortisol.\n\nOn one hand, you don\u2019t want it because an increase in cortisol will lower testosterone levels and cause poor sleep which will further ruin your hormones.\n\nUgg\u2026 this can all get very confusing and contradictory, right.\n\nLet Me Simplify It For You\n\nLift weights, 3-4x a week. Maybe every other day is ideal for example.\n\nWorkout for 45-60 minutes. Try not to go over an hour unless you\u2019re taking longer breaks or just chatting a lot more. Work harder and smarter, not longer.\n\nKeep your rest periods to around 2 minutes. Between 90 seconds to 3 minutes between sets.\n\nKeep your reps around 8-15 upper body and 10-20 lower body.\n\nOnce warmed up, go close to failure. Maybe 1-2 reps short of failure for isolation exercises and 2-3 reps short of failure for compound exercises.\n\nPlease don\u2019t go crazy with the cardio, limit it to 20-30 min max on your off days. Or go for a brisk walk for 10 minutes after each meal.\n\nPre-workout or earlier in the day, take a testosterone boosting supplement.\n\nPost-workout, take a cortisol-reducing supplement along with some carbs + protein and 3 grams of Vitamin C. Maybe even take a quick 15 min nap or rest.\n\nBefore bed, take a natural sleeping supplement that will improve deep quality sleep, enhance growth hormone levels and lower cortisol \u2013 all of which will further increase your testosterone levels.\n\nHonestly, I can get a lot more complicated than this. I can get more scientific. But these simple 5 steps will take care of almost everything, 90%.\n\nWhat you need to do now is TAKE ACTION and don\u2019t be like most other people who just passively listen.\n\nDaily action = long-term results.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

No size or shape change.\n\nNo, there will be no change in your levels of testosterone or any other hormones.\n\nNo, it won\u2019t have any change in your sex drive or your ability to have erections.\n\nNope.

And YES, the sperm will be back to normal and you can get someone pregnant again.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think you want to have kids, then go ahead and get a vasectomy.\n\nIt can be liberating.\n\nHowever, as men age and are over the age of 40, you are most likely not making enough testosterone as it is.\n\nYou are almost guaranteed to have hormonal imbalances.\n\nSo, if you want to increase your testosterone, libido, and sex drive \u2013 discover my favorite way of naturally improving your hormones.\n\nIf you want bigger, harder and fuller erections \u2013 make sure you read my recent article about the best and fastest way to improve you erections.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://news.cornell.edu/stories/2004/02/vasectomy-reversal-highly-effective-even-after-15-years\n\nhttps://www.urologyhealth.org/urologic-conditions/vasectomy",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to quickly cover and answer the top 7 most popular questions I\u2019ve received about prostate health.\n\nOne of the important facts about prostate issues is that they can easily be avoided by optimizing your hormones.\n\n1. What\u2019s The Real Cause Of Prostate Problems\n\nGenetics aside, it\u2019s a hormonal imbalance.\n\nAnd despite what you may have heard, high testosterone is NOT the cause of prostate growth \u2013 it\u2019s what testosterone CONVERTS to, which is both DHT and Estrogen.\n\n2. What Are The First Signs Of Prostate Problems\n\nThere are a few, such as:\n\nPainful or burning sensation during urination or ejaculation.\n\nFrequent urination, particularly at night.\n\nDifficulty stopping or starting urination.\n\nErectile dysfunction.\n\nBlood in urine or semen.\n\nAt this point, you would see your doctor so they can do further tests.\n\n3. At What AGE Should You Have Your Prostate Checked?\n\nIf you have a family history of prostate issues, I\u2019d start at age 40. Otherwise, age 50 is the norm.\n\n4. What Are The Best Treatments For An Enlarged Prostate?\n\nThere are lots of options:\n\nSurgery \u2013 LAST resort\n\nDrugs \u2013 Alpha-Blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, which have side effects or don\u2019t treat the cause of the problem\n\nSupplements \u2013 various herbs, vitamins, and minerals. Most don\u2019t work.\n\nThe best mineral is Zinc, combined with copper.\n\nAnd the best and ONLY supplement that does improve and balance all of these hormones is AlphaViril \u2013 which also contains the correct form and dosages for Zinc and Copper.\n\n5. Does An Enlarged Prostate Affect A Man Sexually?\n\nYes, it does. The hormonal imbalances that cause the enlarged prostate are the primary cause of a decrease in libido, sex drive, and cause of erectile problems.\n\nThat\u2019s why so many guys use AlphaViril \u2013 a 20+ year proven formula for prostate and sexual health.\n\n6. I Heard Caffeine Is Bad For The Prostate?\n\nYes, this is correct. Caffeine is a diuretic and increases urination and frequency, which can irritate an already sensitive prostate.\n\n7. Can An Enlarged Prostate Shrink in Size or be \u201cCured\u201d?\n\nThe good news is that whatever prostate problems you may have, it can definitely be improved by optimizing your and balancing your hormones to their youthful levels.\n\nMany guys take AlphaViril, which helps optimize your hormones and thus, helps with the prostate \u2014 in addition to increasing libido, sex drive, muscle mass, decrease in belly fat, and improved memory.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "There are lots of recent stats that clearly show that not only is a depression on the rise in the past decade, but almost 300% more in recent times \u2013 especially since our recent global pandemic.\n\nOf course, stats are never perfectly precise \u2026 However, with all the private emails and messages I\u2019ve been getting over the past year, I can certainly see an increase in depression.\n\nAnd as such, anti-depressant drugs are heavily prescribed now, more than ever.\n\nWhen it comes to men, well\u2026 we pretend we aren\u2019t depressed. Or if we are, we surely don\u2019t share it with other people.\n\nWe pretend everything is fine.\n\nOr, we just numb ourselves with work, TV, food, porn, video games, alcohol, or whatever.\n\nWhich is obviously horrible for your health \u2013 both physically and even more so, emotionally.\n\nBy the way, depression isn\u2019t always manifested with the typical sadness or hopelessness that you hear or think about.\n\nAnger is also a symptom of depression. And men, more than women, tend to feel and show more anger\u2026 which many times may be a symptom or reaction of depression.\n\nNow, the problem with taking antidepressant medications is that the research clearly shows that they don\u2019t work in many people.\n\nThey surely don\u2019t fix the root cause of the depression for most people.\n\nLastly, antidepressant drugs also kill your sex drive \u2013 for both men and women.\n\nBut even more so in men\u2026\n\nAnd for a guy, a low sex drive \u2026 or having impotence or erectile problems, automatically makes us feel even more depressed and not very manly.\n\nWe instantly feel old and a bit, worthless.\n\nSo even if the antidepressant drugs did make you FEEL better, your inability to sexually perform will instantly cause more depression.\n\nSo, What\u2019s The Solution?\n\nOf course, you need to know the underlying cause of your depression or what\u2019s causing you to feel sad or unmotivated.\n\nObviously, that requires some introspection or time spent with a good therapist.\n\nHowever, what if I told you that by fixing your hormones, you\u2019d instantly improve your mood and your sexual performance?\u2026\n\nBecause one thing is for sure, the lower your testosterone, the more unhappy and less driven you are.\n\nIn fact, I believe the best antidepressant for men is maximizing their testosterone levels and optimizing their hormones.\n\nHeck, even in women, testosterone plays an amazing role in mood enhancement and drive \u2013 both sexually and emotionally.\n\nNow, below this video in the description area, I\u2019ve listed important resources, links and videos all about the best and natural ways of increasing your testosterone levels and optimizing your youth hormones.\n\nSo make sure to check out the resources at the bottom of this video.\n\nWHY or HOW Testosterone Improves Your Mood?\n\nWell, hormones are very complicated, so it\u2019s never ONE simple answer.\n\nHowever, there are a few scientific reasons why testosterone is increased naturally, from within.. Endogenously. Not not as much when it\u2019s done with injections, exogenously.\n\nTestosterone promotes neuroplasticity and the activation of the serotonin system.\n\nIt helps produce more dopamine, which increases drive, and makes life more pleasurable and the pursuit of goals more pleasurable.\n\nHigher testosterone levels also mean more balanced estradiol and DHT levels \u2013 both of which have antidepressant effects, when in a normal range \u2013 not high or low.\n\nHigher testosterone levels also allow the body to deal with stress and stress hormones such as cortisol much better. Thus, allowing you to manage and deal with stress better. Making you more resilient.\n\nOptimal testosterone and youthful hormonal balance also make dramatic improvements in sleep quality and duration\u2026 And good sleep improves dozens of hormones and neurotransmitters, all of which are extremely important for positive mood and well-being.\n\nThen, of course, the simple fact that you look better with more muscle and less fat because of higher testosterone levels, makes you feel better.\n\nHigher testosterone gives you energy, which makes you more alert and happy.\n\nAnd lastly and most importantly coming full circle, higher testosterone and optimal hormonal balance improve sexual drive, performance and erections \u2013 which makes any guy feel youthful, driven, and more manly.\n\nAll the above builds confidence and a positive outlook, which is the opposite of depression.\n\nSo, before you blame your life, or try harmful antidepressant drugs, maybe it\u2019s best to FIRST improve your testosterone levels and optimize youthful hormonal balance.\n\nNot only will your health, mood and happiness improve, so will how you look and feel \u2013 which all means more confidence and resilience.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0941950019300119",

So that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m writing this follow-up article with some of the tops frequently asked questions.\n\nNow, if you haven\u2019t read the original article yet, you can click here and read it now before you read this article. Just don\u2019t forget to come back here\u2026\n\n\u2026 okay, so let\u2019s get started.\n\n\u201c\u2026 can holding my pee midway harm my bladder?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 how long do I need to hold my pee?\u201d\n\nSo in my original article, I stated:\n\nKegel exercises are done to strengthen the perineal muscle.\n\nOne way to describe how to do it is by contracting your anus muscle, as if you\u2019re trying to hold in gas\u2026.\n\nAnother way to do it is to stop peeing midway through. Thus, as you\u2019re peeing, \u201ccontract the muscle\u201d that will STOP the pee, midway through.\n\nThat\u2019s it \u2013 that\u2019s a kegel exercise. THAT is how you contact your perineal muscle\n\nMy examples are based now on how you can learn WHERE the perineal muscle is\u2026 and HOW you can feel and contract it.\n\nI am NOT wanting you to go to the bathroom, start urinating and then hold it and start doing the exercise that way.\n\nOnce you know HOW to contract your perineal muscle \u2026 whether it\u2019s by \u201ccontracting your anus\u201d or by \u201cholding your pee\u201d\u2026\n\nThen you can just contract this muscle wherever you are, anywhere you are, any time you want to.\n\nRight now, as you\u2019re sitting reading this article, you can do your kegel exercises by contracting your perineal muscle.\n\nYou can do it while driving. While standing and waiting in line somewhere. Does this make sense?\n\nRemember, the exercise has NOTHING to do with your penis \u2013 it has to do with contracting your perineal muscle.\n\nIf you are, that\u2019s totally fine and it\u2019s normal. The Kegels have lots of benefits \u2013 healthier prostate and better erections are typical and that\u2019s because:\n\nThe exercise is increasing blood flow and circulation to the area.\n\nIt\u2019s also strengthening the muscle that helps give you stronger, harder and fuller erections.\n\nSo if you\u2019re getting erect or harder, that\u2019s a good sign. That means your penis is getting healthier and stronger \u2026 Enjoy!\n\nWell, just like working out at the gym, we start low and build up over time.\n\nI\u2019ve given the \u201csets and reps\u201d in the original article.\n\nHowever, you may just do it for 2-3 minutes at a time, 3x weekly.\n\nThen as you get stronger, you can do it for 5 min, 3x weekly. Then maybe do 5 min, 4x weekly, and then eventually 5x weekly.\n\nYou may do a \u201cdouble split\u201d workout where you do 3 min in the morning and then 3 min at night.\n\nAgain, start low and build up every week.\n\nHOWEVER, just like any muscle, you also don\u2019t want to exercise it every day.\n\nExercise and then rest the muscle so you can see improvements.\n\nIf you have premature ejaculation issues, which is very common \u2014 especially if you\u2019re younger\u2026\n\nStrengthening your perineal muscle with Kegel exercises will allow you to have MORE CONTROL over your penis and thus, you\u2019ll be able to stop yourself from ejaculating too early.\n\nAgain, this takes practice and you need to be mindful.\n\nAnd another side-benefit is that Kegel\u2019s will give you better, more intense, and stronger orgasms.\n\nThis is a great exercise for keeping everything \u201cdown there\u201d, healthy and strong.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal 7 clinically proven ways to quickly and naturally increase your FREE testosterone levels. No drugs.\n\nNow, in a previous video, I discussed the difference between TOTAL and FREE testosterone levels. The pros and cons of each.\n\nNow, one of the primary ways to increase your FREE testosterone is by lowering your sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)\n\nToday I\u2019ll let you know how this can be easily done and what I personally do in my own life.\n\nFor men, some of the symptoms of high SHBG include [19, 20]:\n\nDecreased sexual development (in teenagers)\n\nDecreased sperm concentration and motility\n\nReduced testicle size\n\nBreast growth, also known as gynecomastia or \u201cbitch tits\u201d\n\nReduced bone and muscle mass\n\nDecreased energy and motivation\n\nAs you can see, these problems are similar to having low TOTAL testosterone.\n\nSo, let\u2019s quickly discuss the 7 ways to naturally LOWER your SHBG, so you can increase your FREE testosterone levels.\n\nKeep in mind that I\u2019m going to list the BEST ways, no drugs and I\u2019m going to keep it simple. Nothing complicated\u2026 so you have NO excuse not to take action today.\n\n1 \u2013 Lower Estrogen & Prolactin\n\nAs estrogen levels increase, so does SHBG. Also, as estrogen levels go up, testosterone levels typically come DOWN due to different negative feedback mechanisms.\n\nOne of the best ways to lower your estrogen is to simply lose body fat. Your fat cells produce estrogen all on their own.\n\nFat also increases the aromatase enzymes, which convert your testosterone to estrogen. All the things we do NOT want.\n\nObviously, losing fat can be difficult and takes time.\n\nSo, you can also take natural supplements, such as:\n\nWhite button mushroom extract\n\nVitamin B6, more specifically P-5-P (Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate) \u2013 helps lower prolactin, another \u201cfemale\u201d specific hormone\n\n2 \u2013 Increase Growth Hormone (GH)\n\nNaturally increasing your GH will help lower excess estrogen levels.\n\nIronically, TAKING exogenous and hence, injectable GH can actually increase your estrogen & prolactin levels\n\nHonestly, the best way to increase GH levels is to get deep, quality sleep and that means going to bed before midnight and don\u2019t wake with an alarm.\n\nIf you have a hard time sleeping, there are natural supplements that help promote deep quality sleep and increase natural GH production at any age.\n\n3 \u2013 Improve Liver Health\n\nSince SHBG is mainly produced in the liver, liver damage can result in abnormal SHBG levels\n\nAlmost all drugs will cause stress on the liver. Obviously, so does alcohol.\n\nSo, reduce the drugs and take supplements that support liver health.\n\nThe favorites that I personally take are:\n\nAs I just stated, many drugs are bad and increase your SHBG, directly or indirectly.\n\nIndirectly, by putting stress on the liver.\n\nDirectly would be Marijuana, alcohol, cigarettes, and many OTC drugs such as pain killers and sleeping aids.\n\n5 \u2013 Lower Stress & Cortisol Levels\n\nI think we all know stress is bad for you in so many ways. And this includes SHBG.\n\nOne primary reason for this is as stress hormones such as cortisol go up, so do SHBG and at the same time, both testosterone and GH come down.\n\nObviously, we can\u2019t eliminate stress from our lives, but you can naturally lower cortisol and stress hormones.\n\nJust know that at the very least, get better sleep. And yes, there are very potent and natural supplements that will also lower cortisol levels.\n\nJust one last note \u2013 you want cortisol levels to be low at NIGHT, not during the day.\n\nAll hormones have pros and cons.\n\nThis is why I take my cortisol-lowering support supplements after my workouts and before bed. Before bed is the most important.\n\nDiet, as with everything else, is very important.\n\nWhen it comes to lowering SHBG, make sure you are eating enough animal protein and the good kind, such as:\n\nPasture-raised, free-range red meat, eggs, and chicken\n\nWhile caught seafood, such as salmon. And if you don\u2019t like fish, make sure you take some omega-3 fish oils.\n\nHowever, most importantly is making sure you are eating enough carbohydrates. The good, natural kind \u2013 such as fruits, vegetables, white rice, yams, and so forth.\n\nYes, low carb diets \u2013 such as keto or carnivore do lower free testosterone levels and increase SHBG.\n\nCarbs increase insulin and insulin is a VERY powerful hormone, especially for lowering SHBG and increasing both TOTAL and FREE testosterone levels\u2026 as well as GH and IGF-1\n\n7 \u2013 Take Specific Supplements\n\nI\u2019ve already listed some supplements earlier for lowering SHBG and increasing free testosterone levels, indirectly.\n\nHowever, there are specific vitamins and herbs that work DIRECTLY. The best are:\n\nZinc should also be taken with copper.\n\nVitamin D3, which should also be taken with Vitamin K2\n\nTongkat Ali, Testofen, Horny Goat Weed, Tribulus, Fadagia and a couple of others.\n\nI take an all-in-one supplement that contains all these ingredients.\n\nSo, it\u2019s easy and convenient for me, and obviously less expensive than buying everything separately.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119423\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28087298\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16673210\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23397510/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26761949\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22407091",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/total-vs-free-testosterone-the-real-difference/",
    "content": "Let me give you a simple overview and analogy between total and free testosterone, using money as an example.\n\nSimply stated, your total testosterone is similar to the GROSS income you make. While your free testosterone is like your NET profit \u2013 the money you keep after all of your expenses.\n\nFor example, your monthly paycheck or income is $5000 a month. But after taxes and all of your expenses (rent, food, etc.) you are left with $400 in the bank account.\n\nThe $5000 revenue is like your total testosterone and the $400 profit after expenses, is like your free testosterone.\n\nI use this money example since everyone understands money, income, and expenses.\n\nAbout 98% of the testosterone your body produces \u2013 and in men, this is primarily done through your testicles \u2013 is considered your TOTAL testosterone.\n\nThis 98% of total testosterone is bound to or stuck to either sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), or albumin (a protein made by the liver, in your blood plasma)\n\nThe remaining 2% is unbound. Meaning, that it\u2019s not \u201cstuck\u201d to anything and thus, this is the FREE testosterone.\n\nIt\u2019s free to move around your body and work its magic.\n\nThis \u201cFREE\u201d testosterone is what triggers many of the benefits. It attaches to the receptors in the body and triggers actions with the DNA and so forth.\n\nBy the way, this does NOT take into account your body\u2019s genetic sensitivity at the receptors and thus, how much or how little the testosterone affects your body.\n\nSo, just like the money example, I gave you\u2026 Your total testosterone or \u201cincome\u201d matters. BUT, your FREE testosterone or \u201cNET\u201d profit matters MORE.\n\nBecause that is what makes the majority of the action \u2013 the FREE testosterone.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the big problem \u2013 you go to the doctor because your libido sucks, you\u2019re losing muscle and all of these negative effects.\n\nYou know the importance of testosterone, so you ask your doctor to do a blood test.\n\nYou get the blood test results and your total testosterone is in the normal, healthy range. At the very least, it\u2019s not low.\n\nSo, your doctor says, \u201cyou\u2019re perfectly healthy \u2013 don\u2019t worry about it\u201d.\n\nBUT, he didn\u2019t check or look at your FREE testosterone, which could have been super LOW.\n\nThus, you barely had any net profit at the end of the month and no money in your bank account.\n\nSo now you may be thinking, \u201cgreat, how do I increase my FREE testosterone so I can have more NET profit?\u201d\n\nActually, your goal IS to increase your total testosterone. But we also want to focus even more attention on increasing your FREE testosterone.\n\nSo, how can we accomplish this goal\u2026 naturally?\u2026 without the use of drugs and testosterone injections or creams?\n\nThe good news is there are a few specific ways and I\u2019ve already covered them in another article.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

I\u2019ve gotten a ton of questions about this and finally decided to make a detailed article about it, so you\u2019ll have clarity and hope.\n\nI\u2019m going to reveal the difference between normal vs optimal testosterone levels in men.\n\nWhy 99% of all blood tests done by doctors are incorrect and worthless\n\nWhat hormones and imbalances cause a decrease in your testosterone levels\n\nHow to make quick improvements, rebalance, optimize, and even fix your hormones, naturally\n\nThis is especially important considering that in the past 50-100 years, we are producing far LESS testosterone than we used to.\n\nAnd the decline is starting earlier, in your mid-20s and it\u2019s falling faster and faster.\n\nHowever, the good news is that you CAN have higher testosterone levels, which can cause:\n\nAn increase in muscle mass, size, and strength\n\nDecrease body fat, especially around the belly and \u201clove handles\u201d\n\nHigher sex drive and harder, bigger erections\n\nMore energy and stamina\n\nBetter memory and cognition\n\nMuch higher drive and motivation\n\nAnd simply stated, you\u2019ll look and feel younger. And all of this works at any age, young or old.\n\nI\u2019ll also share with you my own personal experience with low testosterone when I was only 19 years old. However, before I share that interesting story, let\u2019s first start with:\n\nWhat\u2019s The \u201cNormal\u201d Range\n\nLet\u2019s start from the beginning with today\u2019s topic \u2013 What IS the normal range for testosterone levels for guys and more importantly, what are the optimal, best, and most ideal numbers you should have, regardless of your age?\n\nAssuming you do a hormonal blood test and not saliva, the numbers will vary from one lab to the next, US versus international\u2026\n\nHowever, the basic numbers will be in the range of 300 \u2013 1000 ng/dL.\n\nUnfortunately, the regular, uninformed, and lazy doctor will only do a blood test for testosterone levels. And if it falls BELOW 300, they will then diagnose you with \u201chypogonadal\u201d and thus, you have \u201cLow Testosterone\u201d.\n\nA slightly more educated doctor will allow a little more flexibility in the range and will say you have low testosterone if your levels are below 350-400 ng/dL or that this could be a potential concern.\n\nOf course, what time of the DAY you do your blood test matters, how you slept, stress levels, and other hormones all affect your results and can give you inaccurate numbers, which I\u2019ll talk about in future articles.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you in a minute what will be optimal levels. However, let\u2019s first talk about the problem with the blood test, to begin with.\n\nThe Problem With Your Doctor & The Blood Tests\n\nAs stated earlier, most blood tests are worthless.\n\nYour doctor will typically do only a \u201ctotal\u201d testosterone level. Maybe if you\u2019re lucky, he\u2019ll also do a \u201cfree\u201d testosterone level and also measure your Sex hormone-binding Globulin (SHBG).\n\nThink of your \u201ctotal testosterone\u201d as similar to the total income you make each year. While your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels are more like your NET income \u2013 the money you have AFTER taxes and so forth.\n\nThus, both are important. However, your free testosterone level is more valuable because this is what\u2019s available and more biologically active.\n\nOther IMPORTANT Hormones That Affect Your Testosterone Levels\n\nHowever, let\u2019s just say your testosterone level was low or not where it should be. What\u2019s the cause of it?\n\nYour doctor has no idea because he didn\u2019t ALSO check other important hormones that all affect your testosterone levels. And these would be:\n\nEstradiol (sensitive version) \u2013 this is the most important form of estrogen, which if it\u2019s too high, causes fat gain, moodiness, depression, and gynecomastia (man-boobs) Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) \u2013 This is your \u201chair loss\u201d hormone that tends to cause many of the negative effects of testosterone. If this is high, you\u2019ll start to be bald and have excess body hair. Cortisol \u2013 is one of the most potent stress hormones. This will cause lots of problems, such as belly fat, muscle loss, high blood sugar, water retention, high blood pressure, and so on, and so forth.\n\nEstradiol (sensitive version) \u2013 this is the most important form of estrogen, which if it\u2019s too high, causes fat gain, moodiness, depression, and gynecomastia (man-boobs)\n\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT) \u2013 This is your \u201chair loss\u201d hormone that tends to cause many of the negative effects of testosterone. If this is high, you\u2019ll start to be bald and have excess body hair.\n\nCortisol \u2013 is one of the most potent stress hormones. This will cause lots of problems, such as belly fat, muscle loss, high blood sugar, water retention, high blood pressure, and so on, and so forth.\n\nIf any of these hormones are high, your testosterone will be lower. If all are high, then you\u2019ve got some major problems.\n\nOn a side note: there are a few other hormones to check for, such as Prolactin, DHEA, Progesterone, Pregnenolone, thyroid, and others. These are important, but secondary to the 3 mentioned earlier.\n\nNow, at the bottom of this article, I\u2019ve got 2 important links you should take a look at, which will reveal how to naturally raise your testosterone levels and also optimize these hormones with a solution that I\u2019ve been using myself for over 20 years.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t go there just yet. Let me continue with my own personal story about all of this and why I became an endocrinology, \u201chormone\u201d doctor.\n\nMy Personal Story & Struggles With Low Testosterone\n\nLet me continue with a personal story. At the age of 19, I felt something was just off. I had a hard time building muscle and losing fat. I had puffy nipples. I was even starting to notice a little bit of hair loss.\n\nObviously, none of this was good.\n\nSince I was already very much into the body, hormones, and so forth\u2026 I went to my doctor to do a full hormone blood test. He refused at first, saying there was no need.\n\nBut I was persistent and he finally gave in.\n\nWell, when the results came back, I knew I was right. I don\u2019t remember the exact numbers since that was almost 30 years ago.\n\nHowever, I clearly remember that:\n\nTestosterone was around 350. This was normal but low. Remember, the range is between 300-1000 ng/dL Estradiol (estrogen) was normal but high! Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was normal but high!\n\nTestosterone was around 350. This was normal but low. Remember, the range is between 300-1000 ng/dL Estradiol (estrogen) was normal but high! Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was normal but high!\n\nTestosterone was around 350. This was normal but low. Remember, the range is between 300-1000 ng/dL\n\nEstradiol (estrogen) was normal but high!\n\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT) was normal but high!\n\nAnd there it was, crystal clear why I was having all of these problems.\n\nHonestly, I was super excited. I was right. I had evidence of the problem. Now I needed to go fix it.\n\nHowever, the stupid doctor argued with me when I told him all of this.\n\nHe said, \u201cno, everything is fine\u2026 you\u2019re within the \u201cnormal\u201d ranges\u201d\n\nBut I protested and said, \u201cokay, but NONE of this is in the OPTIMAL range. Besides, I\u2019m young, only 19 years old. This is as good as it\u2019s going to get and it SUCKS! Things are only going to get worse as I get older\u201d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cwell, you\u2019ll deal with that later. Right now, you\u2019re fine and you\u2019re healthy and young. Stop being so obsessive about things that don\u2019t matter\u201d\n\nWell, this just pissed me off even more.\n\nI also felt helpless and hopeless. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he want to help me?\u201d, I thought.\n\nI guess as with any bad thing, there\u2019s also something good because that entire situation changed the trajectory and direction of my life. This was the primary reason I decided to be an endocrinologist, a \u201chormone\u201d doctor.\n\nSo I can fix my body and also help others. So I can give hope to those who are also struggling with health problems, most of which are hormone-related.\n\nFortunately, my so-called \u201cobsessiveness\u201d, or what I call PASSION, turned that dream into a reality and I\u2019m fortunate and grateful that I get to help thousands and millions of people around the world because of the internet.\n\nAnd as stated earlier, I\u2019ve got two very important links at the bottom that will help fix all of these hormonal problems for you.\n\nWhat Are Optimal Testosterone Levels\n\nHowever, I do want to end today\u2019s topic with what should be your optimal testosterone and hormonal levels.\n\nSimply stated, you want your testosterone to be at least 600 ng/dL and I prefer over 800 ng/dL. Remember, the range is between 300-1,000 ng/dL.\n\nI\u2019m almost 50 and my current level is around 900 to as high as 1,200 ng/dL at times. And this is all done naturally with an improved lifestyle and specific supplements, herbs, and vitamins.\n\nAgain, all of the \u201chow-to\u201d instructions are found below, at the bottom of this article.\n\nRegardless of your age, you want normal, but high testosterone levels.\n\nLastly and in many ways, more importantly, you want your \u201cnegative, anti-testosterone\u201d hormones to be on the lower, normal levels. This is for your estradiol, DHT and cortisol levels.\n\nBy keeping these levels in the optimal and balanced ranges, you\u2019ll age better and help prevent many health problems.\n\nOkay, that\u2019s it for today. This is a very important topic and it\u2019s a little longer than I wanted it to be. But my only goal is to help you and give you clarity.\n\nSo read it again, so you\u2019ll get a better understanding.\n\nHelp your friends and share this article with them.\n\nAnd make sure you visit these links below \u2013 you\u2019ll discover exactly how to fix and optimize your hormones naturally and the formula I have used over the years.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

It\u2019s more of a stretching exercise.\n\nKegel\u2019s contract and strengthen. Reverse Kegels relax and stretch.\n\nTogether, they help balance the pelvic floor muscles and thus, help improve your erection strength and stamina.\n\nHOW To Do A Reverse Kegel?\n\nImagine trying to pee really hard or even trying to fart.\n\nWhile a kegel you contract the muscles and thus, you try to STOP peeing and you try to hold in the fart.\n\nHere, you do the opposite \u2013 push as if you\u2019re peeing or trying to fart.\n\nWHEN Should It Be Done?\n\nReverse Kegels can be done at any time, any place. You can do it sitting, standing, or laying.\n\nHowever, I suggest you do them after you do your Kegel exercises.\n\nHow LONG? How Many Sets?\n\nEach reverse Kegel should last about 2-3 seconds and you can do like 10 repetitions.\n\nStart with doing 1 set of 10 reps and eventually work up to doing 2 or 3 sets of 10 reps.\n\nWeekly volume matters, but training it more often is better.\n\nHere are some important links.\n\nOne to the original Kegel article.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/gain-45-more-muscle-eating-this-type-of-egg/",
    "content": "When I started working out, back in the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s, all the bodybuilders were big into eggs. Eggs for more muscle. However, not the whole eggs, but only the egg whites.\n\nActually, the opposite of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, when they eat all whole eggs.\n\nBack then, we had two types of protein powders \u2013 dairy and egg whites. Nothing else.\n\nBack Then, It Was All About Fat\n\nI remember this one time going to this bodybuilder\u2019s home and he had a dozen hard-boiled eggs. I thought he was going to eat them all\u2026 which was going to be about 1000 calories.\n\nHe did eat all dozen eggs, but with a twist \u2026 He took out all the yolks and either threw them in the garbage or gave it his rottweiler dog.\n\nI asked him why, since it\u2019s all protein and it\u2019s a waste of money throwing away the yolks. And trust me, this guy was barely getting by each month.\n\nHe said how the fat is bad for you and all the muscle-building protein is in the egg whites.\n\nWell, it made sense to me back then, considering he was big and I was small.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s just how it was back then \u2013 everyone was against fat. Egg yolks supposedly caused heart attacks and shot up your cholesterol levels.\n\nNow we know this isn\u2019t true \u2026\n\nOf course, bodybuilders didn\u2019t care about their heart or cholesterol levels.\n\nThey just didn\u2019t want to get fat and hence, why they didn\u2019t eat the yolks since that\u2019s where the majority of the calories are from.\n\nBasically, more egg whites mean more protein, which means more muscle \u2013 that was the theory back then and it made sense.\n\nYet, now we know better about this as well.\n\nScientists Reveal \u2013 Egg Whites or Whole Eggs?\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois and the University of Toronto did an interesting experiment.\n\nThe scientist got a bunch of 21-year-old men, who had all been weight training.\n\nThey did leg workouts with them. Four sets of 10 reps on both the leg press machine and leg extensions. Total of 8 sets.\n\nAfter the workout, they gave half the guys egg whites only and the other half whole eggs. Both received 18 grams of protein.\n\nOf course, the whole egg group had more calories due to the fat in the yolks.\n\nHowever, they then repeated the same experiment, switching the eggs around.\n\nSo now the egg white group got the whole eggs, while the whole egg group, got the egg whites.\n\nThus, it was a fair comparison and experiment\n\nAfter doing both blood tests and muscle biopsies, they discovered that the whole egg group had great levels of mTOR, which is one of the most important signals for promoting muscle growth.\n\nNow, continuing one\u2026 typically speaking, the higher the mTOR, the greater the protein synthesis \u2014 which again, means more muscle growth.\n\nIncidentally, this is one of the mechanisms of steroids \u2013 increased protein synthesis.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the interesting part \u2013 the whole eggs group increased protein synthesis by 45% MORE than the egg white group.\n\nThus, a much higher probability of gaining muscle over time.\n\nNow, what\u2019s so special about the whole egg that could have caused such a large spike in protein synthesis?\n\nThe researchers weren\u2019t sure.\n\nNature Made It Perfect\n\nBut I personally think one main reason is that the WHOLE egg contains all the amino acids. Half in the yolk and half in the white.\n\nThe Biological Value of the WHOLE egg is almost 100% \u2013 which is better than almost all proteins.\n\nThus, nature made it perfect.\n\nThe yolk also does contain cholesterol, which is needed to make hormones \u2013 including testosterone, probably the most potent muscle-building hormone in the body.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re going to eat eggs and want to build more muscle and have higher testosterone levels, it\u2019s best to also eat the yolks.\n\nYou may want to do 4 egg whites and 2 whole eggs if you don\u2019t want to do all whole eggs and extra calories and fat. Just make sure to not only do egg whites.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/10-ways-cannabis-affects-libido-testosterone-sexual-performance/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve been getting lots of questions about cannabis and marijuana the past couple of years, especially, since it\u2019s been legalized in so many states here in the US.\n\nOf course, most of the questions are sexually related\u2026 This is what I\u2019m going to cover today:\n\nTestosterone levels Libido Sex drive (physical & emotional) Orgasm quality Premature ejaculation Erectile dysfunction Man boobs/gynecomastia Sperm quality & fertility Sexual pleasure & sensations Difference between men vs women\n\nSex drive (physical & emotional)\n\nPremature ejaculation\n\nMan boobs/gynecomastia\n\nSperm quality & fertility\n\nSexual pleasure & sensations\n\nDifference between men vs women\n\nOne thing I\u2019d like to mention before starting\u2026Just like any drug, marijuana affects everyone differently, based on genetics, hormones, and of course, the TYPE of cannabis and dose.\n\nOf course, I am NOT condoning the use of Marijuana and NEVER breaking the law. I\u2019m just here answering the top questions I\u2019ve been asked.\n\nSo I\u2019ll start with the #1 question I get, how does pot affect testosterone levels? Generally speaking, chronic use LOWERS both total and free testosterone levels, while increasing SHBG at the same time.\n\nYes, there are studies that show otherwise. But like I said, too many factors are involved and studies are never done very accurately.\n\nHowever, anecdotally and in my opinion over the past few years, I can for sure say that using cannabis lowers testosterone levels.\n\nNow, if you want to still use it \u2013 that\u2019s fine. Just take some other natural herbs and vitamins that\u2019ll quickly fix this and shoot up your testosterone levels.\n\nPremature Ejaculation\n\nNow, a lot of guys have premature ejaculation or at the very least, they\u2019d like to last longer.\n\nSome studies have shown that men who frequently use cannabis, orgasm quickly and complain about being \u201cdissatisfied with the length of their sexual performance\u201d.\n\nHowever, you\u2019d think that with the lower testosterone levels, they would last longer.\n\nLonger-Lasting Orgasms\n\nIronically, even though using marijuana may cause you to orgasm faster than you\u2019d like, apparently your orgasm typically lasts longer.\n\nThis is even more evident in women.\n\nNo science behind this, just a lot of user feedback.\n\nMan-Boobs / Gynecomastia\n\nThere is also evidence that shows men who use lots of marijuana, tend to develop man-boobs or gynecomastia.\n\nWell, for one reason \u2013 the lowered testosterone levels may cause an imbalance and thus, leave you to have higher estrogen levels, which causes breast growth.\n\nAnother reason could be that people who chronically use cannabis, tend to eat more and then gain fat. Fat cells produce more estrogen and thus, can lower testosterone and cause gynecomastia.\n\nKeep in mind, that genetics also plays a role here.\n\nHowever, hormones can definitely trigger genes.\n\nSexual Pleasure & Sensation\n\nIt\u2019s been shown that having sex while \u201chigh on pot\u201d can actually increase pleasure and sensation.\n\nMaybe this is why men end up having premature ejaculation.\n\nI think the reason for this is also the fact that you\u2019re more relaxed, maybe more focused, and less distracted while being high, rather than being sober.\n\nErectile Dysfunction & Impotence\n\nNow, this is a big topic for the guys. Not being able to perform, really kills your confidence\u2026 not to mention the mood.\n\nAs stated earlier, while some people aren\u2019t able to last long after using marijuana, others weren\u2019t able to get it going at all.\n\nStudies have shown that erectile dysfunction is three times more likely for daily cannabis users than non-users.\n\nAgain, this comes down to hormonal imbalance, the increase in estrogen and female hormones, while simultaneously decreasing the primary hormone that controls your sex drive \u2013 testosterone.\n\nSo, either decrease the cannabis or improve your hormones.\n\nSperm Count, Quality & Fertility\n\nIf your goal is to have a baby or you care about your sperm, you better think twice about using cannabis.\n\nA 2015 study found that male sperm counts drop by 28% if they used marijuana more than once per week compared with those who did not use it at all.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 just ONCE a week causes a 28% drop in sperm count and quality.\n\nAgain, all hormone-related\u2026\n\nNow comes another fun fact \u2026 While marijuana may cause a decrease in testosterone and erectile problems, as stated earlier, it may NOT have the same negative effects on your libido.\n\nOne study found that people who use marijuana were more likely to have more sexual encounters and partners than people who do not use cannabis.\n\nOn average, marijuana users had about 20% more sex than non-users.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t a study about the scientific effects of marijuana and how it affects the brain, but it does show that if you use marijuana, you\u2019re probably getting lucky a little more than people who do not.\n\nOf course, this also probably has to do with your environment, the people around you, lowered inhibitions, age groups, so on and so forth.\n\nDifference Between Men Vs Women\n\nNow, most of today\u2019s talk was geared toward men. But, how does marijuana affect women and their sex drive?\n\nIn one study it showed that women who used cannabis before sex were about 2x happier\u2026 They reported higher sex drive, improvement in orgasms, and a decrease in pain.\n\nI think with women, it\u2019s more to do with their minds and allowing them to relax and have lowered inhibitions. Similar to alcohol.\n\nAnd, similar to alcohol for men, marijuana may relax them and give them more confidence. Unfortunately, their physical performance suffers due to the negative hormonal effects.\n\nAnd for some, cannabis just makes them tired and completely disinterested in doing anything \u2013 including having sex.\n\nSo what does all of this mean for you?\n\nWell, you need to see how you perform and feel. You have to be honest with yourself.\n\nOne thing is for sure, chronic use of cannabis even 1-2x weekly, let alone daily, for sure negatively affects your hormones and causes negative sexual performance.\n\nSo, you may consider using a lower dose or less often.\n\nAnd make sure you improve your hormones naturally and increase your testosterone levels, even if you choose to continue using cannabis, by utilizing natural herbs.\n\nRemember, herbs are very powerful \u2013 you just need to use them correctly.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6522945/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856894/",

Every week I get asked about how ketogenic diets affect:\n\nI will discuss each of these important topics, individually\u2026 in another article.\n\nReal Truth About Keto Diet\n\nHowever, today I want to discuss the real truth and clinical facts about how ketogenic diets affect your testosterone levels and thus, your muscle mass, fat loss, mood, and sex drive.\n\nAnd why should you listen to me?\u2026 well, other than the fact I\u2019m an anti-aging, endocrinology (hormone) doctor\u2026 I actually did my first ketogenic diet almost 25 years ago!\n\nI also helped write a book about this topic a couple of decades ago.\n\nAnd I had spoken to one of the pioneer doctors about this topic, Dr. Atkins \u2026, and how it affected his patients \u2013 both in the short and long run.\n\nSo\u2026 you can say I\u2019m a bit of an \u201cexpert\u201d and have \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d.\n\nAnd bring up this topic today because Timothy asked in one of my video comments:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been following a ketogenic diet for the past 5-6 weeks and I wanted to know if it makes my testosterone levels better or worse? I ask because I am losing weight and I felt good the first couple of weeks. But I\u2019ll be honest with you, I kinda feel like crap now. I think the weight I\u2019m losing is a lot more muscle and my sex drive is down the toilet!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m glad Timothy brought this up because what he is going through is typical and it\u2019s even worse for women I\u2019ll explain why and how you can fix this.\n\nHow Keto Affects Your Hormones\n\nSo in regards to testosterone levels \u2013 yes, ketogenic diets can dramatically drop your levels and screw up a lot of your hormones, especially your stress hormone, cortisol.1,3\n\nSo as cortisol goes up, your testosterone goes down. And for women, it also causes hormonal imbalances and can really mess up their menstrual cycles long-term.\n\nI\u2019ve seen these negative hormonal changes over and over again during the years, including in myself. I personally feel horrible on Ketogenic diets. Granted, some people like them.\n\nBut hormonally speaking, the majority of blood tests I\u2019ve seen over the years, almost always caused negative changes in your youth hormones \u2013 especially your testosterone and cortisol ratios.\n\nIn fact, a study showed that by just by reducing your carbohydrates down to 30% of your calories, testosterone levels dropped by 36%!5\n\nAnd this was just 30% of calories \u2013 A ketogenic diet is only 5% carbohydrates, so can just imagine how much LOWER your testosterone will be.\n\nIn fact, the results are even worse with Olympic athletes and weight lifters.4\n\nSo What\u2019s The Solution\n\nIF you really want to follow a ketogenic diet, do one that\u2019s cyclical. Maybe 5 days on, 2 days off\u2026 where you \u201ccarb-up\u201d during the 2 days \u201coff\u201d.\n\nAnd limited the ketogenic diet for only a few weeks or a couple of months at the most, until your reach your goal.\n\nIf you want to follow it long-term, just monitor your hormones, and how you look and feel. Remember, carbohydrates aren\u2019t evil. There are \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d carbs.\n\nIn fact, when glucose levels are present in your blood, your brain signals your body to stimulate testosterone production. However, when glucose is depleted, testosterone synthesis also decreases.6\n\nA Clinically Researched, \u201cQuick Fix\u201d Solution\n\nHowever, if you want to boost your testosterone levels, while ALSO improving the balance of your other hormones \u2014 such as female and stress hormones, check my special formula.\n\nYou can \u201ccopy\u201d the testosterone boosting formula anytime you want to build more muscle, lose belly fat and increase your libido.\n\nYou can use it during a Ketogenic diet to help prevent the testosterone lowering effects.\n\nOr you can just use it with any type of diet or workout plan, to optimize your hormones, so you can look and feel young.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nYancy, WS et al.

However, today I\u2019m going to share something that\u2019s recently happened to my family.\n\nA couple of months ago, my father\u2019s doctor decided to give him a new medication that I didn\u2019t know about. Within a few days, my dad started to feel weaker. In the process, one day he actually ended up falling backward, cracked his skull, and was rushed to the emergency room.\n\nMy dad had internal bleeding and massive inflammation in his brain.\n\nHere\u2019s a picture of him. He\u2019s 90 years old.\n\nHe was in a coma for a few days, then stayed in the ICU for another week, then continued to stay at the hospital for another 2-3 weeks. Then he went to rehab, so he can learn to walk again and communicate.\n\nAnd thank goodness, he finally has come home just recently.\n\nIt\u2019s been a very draining time for the entire family \u2013 time, emotions, money, etc.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m sharing this story with you because the entire time, my dad has had a catheter in him, since he wasn\u2019t able to move, go to the restroom, and urinate.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know, a catheter goes into the urethra (penis hole), into the bladder, and basically extracts urine into a bag. This is because my dad couldn\u2019t move for a few weeks.\n\nEvery time we tried to remove the catheter, he wasn\u2019t able to urinate on his own. He was in tremendous pain.\n\nBasically, his muscles had gotten very weak after 2 months of non-use because he had a catheter in him the entire time.\n\nAdditionally, his prostate had grown during this time, making it even more difficult to urinate.\n\nAt this point, he had tears in his eyes and said how he is of no use and doesn\u2019t feel like a man. He has to now use a cane and has a bag of urine attached to his leg.\n\nIt was heartbreaking to see the aging process. I felt really bad at this point. I felt helpless. I knew he would get better, but when, or how long will it take?\n\nSo I decided to give my dad some supplements to reduce prostate size and inflammation.\n\nHowever, more importantly, I had my dad do kegel exercises, to help strengthen the muscles below the bladder that help control urination.\n\nI explained to him how to do the kegel exercises and at this point, he was willing to try anything.\n\nAfter just one week, we went back to the doctor to remove the catheter and see if my dad was able to urinate on his own this time. Guess what \u2013 he did!\n\nIt was great news and you can see it in my dad\u2019s smile.\n\nHe did wear an adult diaper for a few days, just to be safe. But he just stopped doing that as well.\n\nImprovement In One Week\n\nOf course, I can\u2019t say for sure if it was time, the supplements, or the kegel exercises that caused the big improvements in just one week. But I really do believe the Kegels were a big factor because it helps strengthen the muscles around the bladder, prostate, and pelvic floor.\n\nKegels have lots of benefits. Today\u2019s was about the benefits for the prostate and improving urinary flow.\n\nBut Kegels are fantastic for helping with erectile problems as well.\n\nWith that said, I did make another article about this topic. It\u2019s entitled #1 Exercise For Preventing Erectile Dysfunction & Improving Your Performance In The Bedroom.\n\nTake a look at the article right now, get all the details, dos, and don\u2019ts about Kegels and improve your \u201cmanhood\u201d and be the best that you can be!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

However, I\u2019ve noticed I started having erectile problems. Things don\u2019t seem to work as well. In fact, I\u2019m just not in the \u201cmood\u201d or have the drive for sex like I used to. Do you think the statin drug is the cause?\u201d\n\nHi Daniel. To answer your question \u2013 YES!\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s been clinically shown that statin cholesterol-lowering drugs do in fact, cause erection problems and impotence.1\n\nAnd this is because statin drugs lower cholesterol by blocking the enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase) in your liver, which is responsible for making cholesterol.\n\nUnfortunately, cholesterol is required to make your \u201csex hormones\u201d in both men and women, such as testosterone, estrogens, etc. And these hormones, especially testosterone, are required for your sex drive, libido, erections, and orgasm.\n\nIn fact, in addition to erectile problems, both men and women taking statin drugs, report having difficulty reaching an orgasm.2\n\nAnother common side effect of statin drugs is depression.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, when you\u2019re not feeling happy or excited, then you\u2019re not feeling \u201csexual\u201d and you just don\u2019t care or have the DESIRE to have sex, right?\u2026\n\nOne thing I\u2019d like to point out on the OPPOSITE side of this story and that having very high cholesterol can ALSO cause erectile dysfunction.\n\nThis is because of plaque build-up in your arteries, leading to poor blood flow and circulation.\n\nSo your goal is to have healthy cholesterol levels \u2013 not too high or low. You want to do it naturally, without the use of drugs such as statins.\n\nThe truth is, 98% of people do NOT need statin drugs to lower cholesterol. I know this because I dealt with this problem back in 1998 with both my parents. You can easily do it naturally.\n\nA healthy diet, regular exercise program, and more importantly, the specific use of clinically proven herbs can dramatically lower your cholesterol naturally, while ALSO improving your sex drive and libido.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4023379/\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20100416/statins_may_lower_testosterone_libido",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/anything-better-than-viagra-for-erectile-dysfunction/",
    "content": "Is there anything better than Viagra for helping erectile dysfunction?\n\nThe answer is, YES \u2013 there is something much better than Viagra and it\u2019ll work every time, for every person.\n\nFirst, know that Viagra and similar PDE5 inhibitors such as Cialis and Levitra do not FIX erectile dysfunction \u2013 which should be your primary goal\u2026.\n\nAnd the reason these drugs don\u2019t work for many guys is that the underlying problem or cause is never fixed and that\u2019s typically incorrect hormonal balance.\n\nBasically, the main cause of erectile dysfunction is low total and free testosterone levels. In addition to incorrect and unbalanced levels of female hormones, stress hormones, insulin, and DHT \u2013 the hair loss & prostate problem hormone.\n\nYou should improve and fix the underlying problem FIRST \u2013 rather than using drugs that simply mask the problem, such as Viagra, Cialis, and similar drugs.\n\nWhat Is Better Than Viagra?\n\nWell, it\u2019s a drug called TriMix.\n\nTriMix consists of three active ingredients or drugs:\n\nAlprostadil (al-praa-stuh-dil) \u2013 a prostaglandin (PGE1), which acts as a vasodilator and hence, improves blood flow. This can be a standalone drug found in Caverject or Edex\n\nPhentolamine (fen-taa-luh-meen) \u2013 also a vasodilator\n\nPapaverine (puh-pa-vr-een) \u2013 an alpha-blocker or more specifically, a-adrenergic antagonist, which again acts as a vasodilator\n\nBasically, three different drugs which work differently than PDE5 inhibitors such as Viagra\u2026 Yet, have the same basic goal \u2013 to increase blood flow to the penis.\n\nHowever, TriMix is very direct and it\u2019ll basically work every single time for every person.\n\nThe other benefit is that it works quickly, within 5-10 minutes. Unlike Viagra which can take 30 minutes or longer and Cialis which can take an hour or longer.\n\nAnd typically TriMix lasts about 45-60 minutes, so no lingering effects.\n\nHowever, there are some very important things to note if you\u2019re interested in using it:\n\nIt does require a prescription and most doctors won\u2019t give you one.\n\nIt\u2019s typically made by a compounding pharmacy, so it\u2019s not just sitting on the shelf at your local pharmacy. It\u2019s specially formulated and needs to be refrigerated.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the biggest thing to know \u2013 it\u2019s injected directly into the penis. Yup\u2026 a big turn-off for most guys.\n\nHonestly, TriMix is a last-step method for getting an erection. It\u2019s used more in guys who have circulation problems \u2013 such as an injury to the penis or if you have a vascular problem.\n\nBut, you asked what\u2019s more effective than Viagra and TriMix is it!\n\nAs I stated, it works every time, for every person! Please ask your doctor if you want to use it.\n\nSafest & Easiest Solution\n\nHowever, I\u2019m going to repeat what I stated at the beginning of today\u2019s message \u2013 you need to FIRST fix the underlying problem and that means optimizing and balancing your youth hormones and for sure, boosting your total and free testosterone levels.\n\nSuch as natural alternatives to Viagra.\n\nAs well as my favorite vitamins for boosting your testosterone levels and promoting youthful hormonal balance.\n\nTake action and fix this part of your life once and for all and get your manhood and confidence back.\n\nBecause we both know that the older you get, the worse this problem will become.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "So today\u2019s topic is about one of the men\u2019s favorite topics \u2014 testosterone and erections: Does using the boron supplement work for increasing testosterone levels or improving erections?\n\nBoron is a natural element that\u2019s found in mineral deposits on the earth all over the world. So, it\u2019s naturally occurring\u2026\n\nThe two main benefits of using boron for the most popular reasons are healthy bones and better testosterone levels.\n\nDoes Boron Really Work\n\nAs far as increasing testosterone levels and improving erections, the short answer is \u201cyes\u201d, IF you use the correct form and dose.\n\nIn a 2015 clinical study and review, it showed that taking 6 mg daily for just one week, has numerous benefits, such as:\n\nIncreasing total testosterone levels\n\nIncreasing FREE testosterone levels by 25%\n\nReducing estradiol by nearly 50%\n\nAllowing more free testosterone to bind with proteins in your blood, can have even more benefits as you age\n\nAs an added bonus, it also showed a reduction in inflammatory markers.\n\nA smaller 2011 study, also showed similar results of increasing total testosterone and reducing estradiol significantly. But this was done at a dose of 10 mg daily for one week.\n\nHowever, there have been studies showing that Boron does NOT work.\n\nA much older 1993 study, showed that a dose of 2.5 mg for 7 weeks, didn\u2019t really do much for improving testosterone levels.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Form & Dose\n\nIn my own research, I discovered the best FORM of Boron is a citrate/aspartate/glycinate complex.\n\nAdditionally, you need to make sure it\u2019s a 5% extract potency.\n\nLastly, 6-10 mg daily is a good dose. But 8-10 showed the best results.\n\nThis is why in AlphaViril, the average use dose contains 10 mgs daily.\n\nHence, why AlphaViril has been so potent, popular, and one of the best sellers for over 20 years.\n\nI created the product for myself. I know it works. I have 20+ years of proof!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712861/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21129941\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8508192",

    "content": "Today, I\u2019ll reveal: what controls semen volume, what causes it to drop, and how to increase it naturally and with drugs.\n\nThis varies greatly from as little as 0.5 ml to as much as 8 ml.\n\nThe average volume is between 3-5 ml.\n\nMost people think the more sperm you have, the more semen volume. But that\u2019s not true.\n\nOnly 2-5% of the ejaculate is actual sperm. Even if you have millions of sperm, they are tiny and microscopic \u2013 they don\u2019t take up much space.\n\nPeople also think the more ejaculation volume, the more fertile the guy is.\n\nGenerally speaking, the volume is not related to fertility. Remember, your semen volume is only 2-5% sperm.\n\nUnfortunately, the older we get, the less semen volume and as well, the quality of sperm.\n\nYou tend to peak in your mid 30\u2019s. The lowest point is 55 years and older.\n\nYour mid 30\u2019s is also when you start to see major NEGATIVE changes in your hormones.\n\nLuckily, this can all be greatly reversed and improved at any age, naturally\u2026.\n\nHow To Increase Semen Volume & Sperm Count\n\nLet\u2019s first discuss natural ways you can implement right now.\n\nDecrease Ejaculation Frequency One way is to not orgasm for a couple of days. Unfortunately, this \u201cbuild-up\u201d can also cause a guy to get overly excited and have premature ejaculation.\n\nStay Hydrated Considering semen is a liquid, staying hydrated can have a positive impact on your ejaculation size.\n\nEat Specific Foods Foods high in zinc is important, the best one being Oysters. You can take specific Zinc supplements.\n\nReduce Stress When stress levels go up, testosterone levels and sperm production goes down. So, you DO need to manage your stress levels or take vitamins that help lower these negative stress hormones.\n\nThere are two other important and fast ways to increase semen volume, sperm, and improve hormones \u2013 that\u2019s with supplements and drugs.\n\nFor vitamins and minerals, Zinc, D3, and Selenium are all important. These have all been clinically verified.\n\nBulgarian Pro-Tribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract (90% Sapongenins + 40% protodioscin)\n\nStinging Nettle (95% Extract) (Urtica Dioica)\n\nGinger Extract (10% gingerols)\n\nMaca Root (.6% macamides and macaenes Extract)\n\nThese herbal extracts are actually proven to support LH and FSH, thus increasing semen volume, sperm production, and testosterone.\n\nYou want to also DECREASE negative hormones such as female (estradiol, prolactin) and stress (cortisol).\n\nNow, there are other herbs that you should also be taking if you also want better erections and libido\u2026 and I\u2019ve listed them all in an all-in-one solution called AlphaViril \u2013 which is what I take and a few porn star guys as well.\n\nShort-term use of HCG (Human chorionic gonadotropin) tells your body and testicles to produce more LH and FSH, thus more testosterone. This can temporarily increase semen volume and even the size of your testicles.\n\nAnd this is ONE of the ways AlphaViril works \u2013 by telling your own body to naturally increase these hormones and thus, you get the benefits without the side effects.\n\nThe problem with taking HCG is that you also produce much more estrogen and other female hormones, which can quickly cause gynecomastia or man-boobs.\n\nThese days many porn guys don\u2019t deal with HCG because of these issues and will simply take various herbs that I mentioned that are all found in AlphaViril.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from Kevin and he asks\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only 28 and for whatever reason, I have impotency issues. I think I\u2019m way too young to have erectile problems, right?\u2026 Sadly, I think it\u2019s gotten worse over the past 6 months. I\u2019m afraid to even have sex because it\u2019s so embarrassing.\u201d\n\nHi Kevin\u2026 yes, you are too young to be having erectile issues. And yes, it can definitely be embarrassing at ANY age, but even more so when you\u2019re \u201cyoung\u201d and it\u2019s not \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nHowever, a study in the July 2013 Journal of Sexual Medicine suggests that ED is more common among younger men than previously thought. Researchers found that ED affected 26% of adult men under 40.1\n\nAlmost half of these men suffered from severe ED. Researchers also noted that younger ED patients were more likely than older men with ED to smoke, drink alcohol, and use drugs.\n\nSo if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re not alone Kevin\u2026\n\nYou Better Fix It Or It\u2019s Only Going To Get Worse\n\nHowever, we want to fix this situation because as you get older, this will only get worse \u2014 both physically and emotionally.\n\nFor \u201colder\u201d guys past the age of 40, typical causes of erectile dysfunction is:\n\nHormonal imbalances (low testosterone)\n\nHealth conditions (blood sugar problems, heart problems, poor blood flow, prescription medications, over-weight, etc.)\n\nHowever, for \u201cyounger\u201d guys in their 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, it\u2019s typically:\n\nHormonal imbalances (low testosterone)\n\nPsychological causes (anxiety, worry, low self-esteem, etc.)\n\nFeelings of sexual excitement that lead to an erection first start in your brain. But conditions such as mood problems can interfere with that process.\n\nIn fact, a major sign of depression is withdrawal from things that once brought you pleasure.\n\nOne of the most common causes of erectile dysfunction for young men is anxiety.2\n\nThis may include concerns about getting someone pregnant, not wanting to appear inexperienced, or worrying about using a condom without embarrassment or losing your erection while putting a condom on.\n\nStress about jobs, money and other concerns contribute to ED. Alcohol and drug use/abuse are both common causes of ED among young men.\n\nAdditionally, relationship problems and poor communication with a partner can cause sexual dysfunction.\n\nAs men age, their testosterone begins to decline\u2026 starting as early as in his mid 20\u2019s.\n\nBy age 40, you barely make half of what you used to in your 20\u2019s and obviously, it only gets worse as you get older.\n\nUnfortunately, due to our modern lifestyle (diet, stress, pollutants, etc.), \u201clowered testosterone\u201d is affecting men at a younger and younger age.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to know is that testosterone is the PRIMARY hormone that controls sex drive, libido, and erections\u2026 BOTH physically and emotionally!\n\nAnd this is because testosterone interacts with OTHER key \u201csex\u201d hormones such as:\n\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT)\n\nDopamine and other neurotransmitters in your brain\n\nThe reason I bring up hormones is that if you\u2019re under extra stress/worry, if you have anxiety, if you\u2019re not sleeping enough, drinking alcohol, smoking (pot or cigarettes) and using drugs \u2026\n\nAll of these \u201cstressors\u201d cause a DECREASE in your testosterone levels and an INCREASE in your \u201cnegative\u201d hormones such as estrogen, cortisol, dopamine, etc\u2026\n\nWhich will all negatively affect your libido and erections \u2014 BOTH physically and emotionally.\n\nSo what we\u2019ve discovered today is that HORMONAL BALANCE is the \u201csecret\u201d to fixing low libido and erectile dysfunction.\n\nHowever, in younger men under the age of 40, your MIND (anxiety, worry, low self-esteem) \u2026 also plays an important factor.\n\nWhat you need to do is not focus on the \u201cproblem\u201d \u2026 which will only cause you more worry, stress, anxiety, and so forth.\n\nBut focus on the \u201csolution\u201d \u2026 which is an improved lifestyle and better hormones.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction/young-men\n\nhttps://www.bpas.org/more-services-information/erectile-dysfunction",

While 26% said longer than 11 minutes would be ideal.\n\nThere are many factors that can influence duration.\n\nWomen need more time, so you better focus a lot more on foreplay.\n\nThis begins within the mind based on the words you use and your attitude.\n\nThen starts the physical, which is kissing and touching.\n\nThat then leads to sexual, but more so oral sex or a combination with touch.\n\nA good goal would be to try and give your lady an orgasm before you penetrate \u2013 this reduces pressure on you, which will improve your performance.\n\nOf course, age and hormones play a HUGE role in how long you can last.\n\nRemember, age and hormones play a big role in Sexual Function or Dysfunction\n\nPremature Ejaculation [PE] \u2013 when a man ejaculates sooner than expected\n\nErectile Dysfunction [ED] \u2013 when a man can\u2019t get or maintain an erection.\n\nPerformance anxiety \u2013 when negative feelings about your sexuality cause you to worry that you won\u2019t satisfy your sexual partner\n\nAny of these 3 situations can affect how long your sex lasts.\n\nThe good news is that all of this can be fixed, permanently! \u2026 and without drugs.

I was tall and skinny.\n\nThe coach wanted me to play varsity basketball the next year \u2013 but, I needed to gain some muscle.\n\nSo, I started working out with weights.\n\nAfter a few months, I started to gain more muscle and strength, lost some belly fat, and so forth.\n\nIt was subtle, but something BIG did change \u2013 I started to get a lot more attention from the girls.\n\nI was getting compliments about my arms, abs, shoulders, and so forth.\n\nAnd the truth is, it felt good.\n\nI was also getting more respect from the guys.\n\nFor the first time, I didn\u2019t feel so invisible. My confidence improved and to make a long story short, I quit the basketball team and start to focus on working out, building muscle, and getting ripped and that\u2019s been my focus for the past 35+ years.\n\nStill, nothing to brag about, but it\u2019s a big improvement from where I started and I\u2019m sure you can achieve similar progress over time.\n\nSo, where am I going with all of this?\n\nWell, today\u2019s topic is about women and if they are more sexually attracted to guys with more muscles?\n\nWell, multiple types of research have continually shown that yes, women prefer men with more muscles.\n\nBut, what defines \u201cmore muscle\u201d?\n\nDifferent studies basically broke things down into 4 body types:\n\nSo, let me just get to the bottom line and save you time.\n\nThe \u201cskinny\u201d guy always came in last place, with less than 5% of women preferring this body type.\n\nThe super \u201cbuilt\u201d guy, who is probably more like a bodybuilder, came in 3rd place at around 15-20% preference by women.\n\nThe \u201clean\u201d guy came in 2nd place, at about 35% preference.\n\nAnd the winner was the \u201cathletic\u201d guy at about 45% preference.\n\nWell, the surveys said and the researchers discovered that women want to feel feminine. They want to feel protected and safe.\n\nThus, the skinny guy instantly loses.\n\nMuscles make a woman feel safe and feminine. As does height.\n\nHowever, being super muscular like a big bodybuilder can be a turn-off. It\u2019s too much muscle.\n\nWomen may also think the guy is too self-absorbed or vein.\n\nThis is why the majority of women prefer the \u201clean\u201d and/or \u201cathletic\u201d look \u2013 with athletic being the clear winner.\n\nEither way, being super skinny or fat is not attractive for most people.\n\nSo, do your best to gain some muscle.\n\nWomen also prefer more upper body muscles \u2013 such as chest, shoulders, and arms. But nobody likes chicken legs or a flat ass \u2013 so, work your lower body as well.\n\nAnother very important fact is that the leaner you are, the better and more muscular you look. Nobody is turned off by ripped six-pack abs.\n\nSo, don\u2019t \u201cbulk\u201d and get fat either as you\u2019re trying to gain muscle.\n\nOf course, the next question is \u2013 great, what\u2019s the best way to gain muscle and still be lean and have six-pack abs?\n\nBest Way To Gain Muscles\n\nWell, I wrote an article about this with over 10 million views. It\u2019s called \u201cThe 4 primary ways to build muscle\u201d\n\nRead the article while it\u2019s fresh on your mind, give it a try and let me know how it works for you!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "As men age, their testosterone levels begin to decline and it starts around your mid 20\u2019s and quickly declines in your 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s. By age 50, you\u2019re barely producing HALF the testosterone you once used to.\n\nTestosterone is a VERY important youth hormone for both men and women, but especially for men. Testosterone gives you muscle size, strength burns fat, gives you energy and vitality, dramatically improves your mood and of course, controls your \u201cdrive\u201d \u2013 both mental and physical.\n\nI\u2019ve created a free video about naturally boosting testosterone levels, but here are some key points to know:\n\nRemove anything that increases your \u201cfemale\u201d hormone Estrogen \u2013 that means no plastics (such as water bottles), don\u2019t microwave your food in plastics either\u2026 and don\u2019t eat soy products. There are natural herbs that help with this as well.\n\nAdditionally, limit alcohol intake since that lowers testosterone AND increases estrogen at the same time.\n\nLifting weights is very important because that increases testosterone. But, doing too many cardiovascular aerobic exercises actually DECREASES testosterone and increases your \u201cstress\u201d hormone, cortisol. Doing weights, 30 minutes, 3x a week is a great start.\n\nHave more eggs and coconut oil \u2013 both dramatically improve testosterone. And don\u2019t worry, coconut oil does NOT increase cholesterol and neither do eggs eaten in moderation. It\u2019s a myth! Actually, eggs increase your good HDL cholesterol.\n\nFinally, take natural herbs and vitamins which are scientifically proven to boost your testosterone levels. I use AlphaViril because it\u2019s scientifically tested and has a 14+ year proven track record for safety and effectiveness.\n\nMake sure you do something today to improve your testosterone levels not only to improve your mood and sexual desire but to also help minimize blood sugar and blood pressure problems and many other ailments!\n\nYou need to take action RIGHT NOW to improve your testosterone levels to youthful levels because the older you get, the worse it\u2019ll be and the more effort it\u2019ll take to make improvements.

    "content": "Today I want to discuss one of the most consumed foods in the US and that\u2019s soy. And it\u2019s a hidden \u201cprotein\u201d source in so many products, especially \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cvegetarian\u201d products.\n\nSoybeans are beans and thus, legumes. They originated from Asia and are eaten in small quantities there, but as the WHOLE bean.\n\nUnfortunately, over 95% of \u201csoy\u201d eaten in the US is made from the soybean into foods such as tofu, soybean oil, soy milk, and various soy proteins.\n\nThis is NOT the natural form of this food. It\u2019s been modified.\n\nIn fact, well over 90% of soy produced in the world is Genetically Modified (GMO) and the crops are sprayed with the herbicide Roundup, which is associated with numerous adverse effects on health.\n\nAnd because it\u2019s so cheap, soybean \u201cmeal\u201d is given to livestock \u2013 which is NOT a natural food for them. And it\u2019s also found in so many processed foods, including \u201chealth\u201d foods.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get right to it and see why I suggest you avoid soy.\n\nSoy is very high in Omega 6 fats, which causes a bad inflammatory response, insulin resistance, and weight gain. Thus, never eat soybean oil.\n\nSoy is also very high in phytates, substances that bind minerals and reduce their absorption.\n\nSoy contains large amounts of biologically active compounds called isoflavones, which function as phytoestrogens\u2026 that is, plant-based compounds that can activate estrogen receptors in the human body.\n\nThese isoflavones are classified as endocrine disruptors, chemicals that interfere with the normal function of hormones in the body.\n\nSo, what does this mean for you?\n\nThe increase in estrogens from soy isoflavones can cause breast health issues. There are lots of clinical studies backing this up.\n\nFor example, in one study after only 14 days of eating soy protein, there was a significant increase in proliferation (increase in number) of the epithelial cells in the breasts, which are the cells that are most likely to turn cancerous.\n\nAnd in another study, there was a 29.2% increased number of breast epithelial cells when were supplemented with soy protein.\n\nThere are also human studies where soy caused disruptions of the menstrual cycle, leading to delayed menses and prolonged menstruation.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the guys.\n\nExposure to soy isoflavones in the womb can lead to adverse effects on sexual development in males \u2014 small penises!\n\nIn one human study, 99 men attending an infertility clinic were studied. The men that had eaten the most soy for the past 3 months had the lowest sperm count.\n\nSoy and the increase in estrogen also cause a reduction in testosterone, leading to lower muscle mass, increase belly fat, and of course lowered libido and even impotence.\n\nSoy can also inhibit the function of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, which is essential for the production of thyroid hormones.\n\nThis slowing of your thyroid seems to be a consistent problem with soy intake and thus, causes you to have a slower metabolism and gain fat.\n\nAlso, lower thyroid product causes hair loss and a decrease in protein synthesis \u2013 leading to muscle loss.\n\nFinally, soy consumption has long been associated with various mental health issues.\n\nAnd the newest research shows that it can also aggravate seizures as well.\n\nIf you want to have some whole, soybeans once in a while \u2013 that are non-GMO \u2013 go ahead. But my suggestion is you stay away from all soy \u2014 including soybean oil and all soy \u201cproteins\u201d, which are found in almost all \u201cvegetable protein\u201d products.\n\nIt\u2019s a cheap ingredient that\u2019s bad for your hormones, health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nHowever, the good news is that once you stop eating soy, a lot of these negative effects will be reversed over the next 2-6 months.",
    "meta_description": "Soy is delicious, versatile, and very popular. However, not many people are aware that the common soy products that we consume such as soy milk and tofu are sprayed with herbicides and have already been genetically modified. Yes, this means that ingesting soy will have adverse effects on your health.",

    "content": "\"Increase My Libido & Testosterone\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb Today I want to reveal the most powerful food for increasing your testosterone levels.\n\nIn fact, when I don\u2019t eat this one food for a few days, I notice that my morning erections are less and sometimes, they don\u2019t even happen.\n\nEmotionally, I\u2019m not as happy or as driven in life. I also notice I\u2019m not as muscular AND, even my memory isn\u2019t as good.\n\nIt\u2019s all minor initially \u2026. but over time, it becomes more noticeable because the minute I add this ONE food back into my diet \u2013 it\u2019s like WOW\u2026 My morning erections and sex drive is super powerful again \u2026 especially when I add in some specific herbs, vitamins and supplements\u2026 which I\u2019ll tell you about in a minute.\n\nAnd today you\u2019ll discover exactly:\n\nWhat this one food is\n\nWhat\u2019s the best kind to buy\n\nHow to prepare it correctly\n\nWhen it\u2019s the best time to eat it.\n\nAnd all of this will only cost you about a dollar or two a day!\n\nOkay, so without any further delay \u2013 this super, testosterone-boosting food is:\n\nAnd yes, I said whole eggs, with the yolk! Egg whites are for losers.\n\nNature made the perfect protein because the egg contains all the essential amino acids \u2013 half are in the white and the other have in the yolk. THAT\u2019S why you need to have the entire egg.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not the \u201cprotein\u201d that\u2019s important for increasing your testosterone \u2013 it\u2019s the CHOLESTEROL found in the yolk!\n\nAnd no, this doesn\u2019t mean you should then have only the yolks \u2013 you need the entire egg.\n\nAnd before I tell you why cholesterol is so important for testosterone production \u2013 I want to first stop and tell anyone listening who is thinking \u201cwait a minute, isn\u2019t this going to raise my cholesterol? Isn\u2019t cholesterol bad for your health?\u201d\n\nThe answer is that yes, eggs do raise cholesterol \u2013 but it\u2019s the good, HDL cholesterol!1,2\n\nSo, that\u2019s the first myth that I want to expose.\n\nThe second is that \u201chigh\u201d blood cholesterol is not due to the cholesterol you eat from your diet.\n\nThis is because 80% of cholesterol is made INTERNALLY, by your liver.1,2\n\nUnfortunately, as we age, as you liver becomes weaker and you have negative changes in your hormones due to aging, your body and liver aren\u2019t as efficient for getting rid of excess cholesterol and that\u2019s why there\u2019s an increase.\n\nRemember, cholesterol is good for your health. EVERY cell in your body requires cholesterol to function properly. And, this is especially important for testosterone production.\n\nThis is also why taking cholesterol-lowering \u201cstatin\u201d drugs causes\n\nMuscle loss and weakness\n\nAnd other health ailments\n\nSo if you do have high cholesterol \u2013 eating eggs isn\u2019t the problem WHEN it\u2019s done correctly and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll tell you in a minute.\n\nEggs and Testosterone Levels\n\nOkay, so getting back to why eggs and cholesterol is so important for testosterone production.\n\nFirst, cholesterol has a similar 4-ring structure to testosterone. And, testosterone is also produced from cholesterol.\n\nAnd the best time have eggs is before bed because most of your testosterone is produced during sleep. So your body will now have enough \u201cfuel\u201d from the cholesterol from the eggs, to maximize the production of testosterone while you\u2019re sleeping \u2014 assuming all of your hormones are functioning correctly.\n\nThe best kind of eggs to have are \u201cpastured\u201d eggs\u2026 NOT \u201cpasteurized\u201d eggs, which have been altered.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice the \u201cfree-range\u201d pastured eggs have a dark, orange yolk \u2013 which is how they are supposed to look. Not the typical \u201clight yellow\u201d junky eggs.\n\nYou want to have about 2-3 eggs a day, again before bed would be the best time. I have 4 or more eggs myself.\n\nYou want the yolks to be liquid still, not solid. So, soft boiled or even raw eggs would be best. And that\u2019s it.\n\nDo the eggs at night and take specific \u201ctestosterone boosting herbs\u201d in the morning and you\u2019ll be set. You\u2019ll feel and look years younger \u2013 with higher testosterone, libido, energy, improved memory and so many other health benefits.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22037012\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0026049565900028\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021013\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8120521",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about masturbating and how it affects your body and especially your mind.\n\nLots of Questions About Masturbation\n\nBecause of my blog and the hundreds of millions of views, in addition to my social media channels, I\u2019ve had a LOT of guys ask me about masturbation.\n\nAnd it\u2019s daily and it doesn\u2019t seem to ever stop.\n\nAnd because of this, I\u2019ve done a lot of articles about this topic and I\u2019ll give you the links to them at the end of this article.\n\nHowever, I figured with all these articles about masturbation it would be enough. But the questions keep coming and at times, I find them somewhat silly.\n\n\u201cHow often can I masturbate, I don\u2019t want to do it incorrectly\u201d \u201cWill it make me lose muscle\u201d \u201cIs it going to shrink my penis if I do it daily\u201d \u201cWill it stop me from growing\u201d \u201cHow quickly can I have an orgasm without it affecting my health\u201d \u201cWill I get some other health problem\u201d \u201cCan I masturbate AND still have sex\u201d And on and on and on\n\nI think to myself, \u201cwhy is he asking me this? Is he being serious?\u201d\n\nAnd then, I stop and go back in time to when I was young.\n\n\u201cMasturbation, Blindness & Hairy Palms\u201d!\n\nThe silly things we used to be told, such as \u201cmasturbating will make you go blind\u201d or \u201cgive you hairy palms\u201d and other stupid things that a young, impressionable boy may believe.\n\nAnd as you may know, most guys are NOT good at communicating. And when it comes to masturbating, this is something we never talked about growing up.\n\nThus, why so many are confused and lost.\n\nIt was something we all did but never spoke about it out loud. It was a taboo topic.\n\nNO Talk About Sex In My Home Growing Up\n\nFor example, in my own home, we NEVER spoke about anything sexual. It was 3 boys \u2013 me and my two older brothers \u2013 and there was never any talk about women. It was odd. But, my dad is really old school and super strict.\n\nI remember this one time the entire family \u2014 mom, dad, and my brothers and I \u2013 were all watching something on TV or a rented movie or something. It was like a Game of Thrones type of movie and some renaissance girl took her top off and exposed her breasts briefly.\n\nWithin seconds my dad says to me, \u201cSon, it\u2019s time for bed\u201d.\n\nMind you, it was like 8 pm.\n\nI think I was in my very early teens and since my brothers were much older than me, 12 and 15 years \u2013 my dad was talking directly to ME.\n\nI thought, \u201cwhat the hell, I\u2019ve seen plenty of tits in my time\u2026\u201d Well, you know \u2013 like in Playboy and stuff.\n\nBut, that was that \u2013 I got up and went to my bedroom and there was never any talk about it, ever.\n\nThus, I got the point \u2013 no talk about sexual stuff, ever!!!\u2026 and certainly not about masturbation.\n\n\u201cWet Dreams\u201d & Nocturnal Emissions\n\nAnother time I remember speaking to one of my best friends, Greg, about this topic when we were in our late 20s and he said, \u201cyeah, growing up my mom told me to never masturbate or else I\u2019ll go to hell, and that I\u2019m a bad person\u2026 And so, I never masturbated growing up.\u201d\n\nI then said, \u201cBut how? \u2026 Men produce hundreds of millions of sperm daily, it has to come out \u2013 especially with the crazy testosterone levels of a teenage boy.\u201d\n\nGreg replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t know \u2013 I guess this is why I had wet dreams every single night. And in the morning, I\u2019d get up early and wash my sheets or underwear, so my mom wouldn\u2019t find out.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t want his mom to think less of him.\n\nThis is all because he was ashamed or embarrassed or felt guilty and didn\u2019t know any better.\n\nThe Masturbation \u201cConfusion\u201d Continues\u2026\n\nUnfortunately, the problem still exists, decades later. Even with the internet, guys are still very confused about the topic of masturbating.\n\nHowever, I DO think that the situation has gotten worse because of all the porn readily available online.\n\nTo a super horny young man, he can\u2019t help himself. Porn can be addictive.\n\nBy the way, this isn\u2019t just men \u2013 women are watching a ton of porn as well.\n\nAnd these days, it\u2019s a lot more hardcore and graphic, compared to when I was young. When all we had was Playboy and maybe Penthouse.\n\nPorn, Masturbation & Addiction\n\nPORN, at a young age, DOES change how the mind perceives sex, himself, and women. It rewires things in the brain.\n\nIt\u2019s addictive due to the Dopamine stimulation, just like cocaine.\n\nSo, for a lot of guys, porn has become a bit of an addiction.\n\nIt gets in the way of productivity, closeness with other people, and sexual connections in relationships.\n\nSomething To Think About\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m going to end today\u2019s topic with some things to think about, IF you\u2019re concerned or confused about masturbation.\n\nIt\u2019s totally natural \u2013 so, don\u2019t feel guilty or ashamed, or think there\u2019s something wrong with you. There is no specific right or wrong way, or how much or how often.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to go blind, get hairy palms, not grow taller, or have other physical problems.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to hell either and God isn\u2019t going to hate you or whatever. He\u2019s got bigger problems to deal with.\n\nHowever, you also cannot let masturbation control you. You can\u2019t let IT and porn control your actions and/or get in the way of relationships or getting stuff done during the day.\n\nThis I see is the biggest problem with masturbation, especially compounded with porn, are the addictive aspects of it.\n\nNot because you\u2019re PHYSICALLY horny, but something PSYCHOLOGICALLY is happening.\n\nThat\u2019s not natural, normal, or healthy.\n\nIt\u2019s more of mental addiction, rather than a physical one.\n\nEven though masturbation is a physical act, NOT mental!\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s it for today. These other masturbation-related articles will help to give you more clarity, so you can feel more confident:\n\nWARNING: The Negative Effects of Masturbation\n\nHow to Stop Masturbating & Should You?\n\nWARNING: Masturbation Shrinks Your Penis\n\nThe #1 Question About The Negative Effects Of Masturbation\n\nMasturbation & Testosterone Levels \u2013 Truth & Clinical Facts\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I want to answer a very important question from Jacob. He writes:\n\n\u201cDoc, I\u2019m totally confused. I\u2019m 48 and I\u2019ve got all the symptoms of having low testosterone. I\u2019ve been doing my research. My doctor says \u201cdon\u2019t worry, this is normal\u201d. I then read some other expert saying how I should increase it, so I can be healthier. And then I read the exact opposite from another \u201cexpert\u201d saying that increasing it can cause health problems. PLEASE HELP me, I\u2019m so confused and I\u2019m so tired of all the contradictory information \u2013 what should I do?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m posting this question because it\u2019s a good one, it\u2019s important and yes, there\u2019s a LOT of misinformation online and yes, it can be very confusing and frustrating. That\u2019s exactly why I write articles and give seminars.\n\n\u2026 to simplify the process for you of getting AND staying healthy!\n\nOne of the biggest problems with aging is hormonal imbalances. There are lots of them, but today I\u2019m going to focus on testosterone levels \u2013 which affect BOTH men and women.\n\nEven though, it does manifest itself much more so in men because of erectile dysfunction, impotence, and of course muscle loss and fat gain.\n\nSo the problem is that as you age, your testosterone levels start decreasing.\n\nThis starts around your mid 20\u2019s. The decline accelerates in your 30s and really starts to drop hard around your 40s and beyond\n\nAt this point, most guys really DO need to increase their testosterone back to its youthful levels, so they can look and feel younger again.\n\nLow Testosterone & Health Problems\n\nNot to mention, low testosterone levels cause many health problems \u2014 such as\n\nheart problems cholesterol and blood pressure problems blood flow and circulation problems blood sugar problems mental decline and memory loss Depression, anxiety\n\ncholesterol and blood pressure problems\n\nblood flow and circulation problems\n\nmental decline and memory loss\n\nSo again, the goal is to increase your testosterone levels, to their higher, youthful levels.\n\nYour Testosterone Boosting Options\n\nAnd to do this, you can either take prescription testosterone \u201cexogenously\u201d, from the outside\u2026 such as testosterone injections or creams containing the drug \u201ctestosterone\u201d.\n\nOr you can do it naturally, \u201cendogenously\u201d, from within\u2026 By taking specific herbs, vitamins and minerals. And of course, improving your lifestyle as well.\n\nNow, the problem with increasing your testosterone is that as you age, your body starts to convert the testosterone to more \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones that LOWER your testosterone.\n\nSo, let\u2019s say you try to increase your testosterone with a drug (exogenously) or supplements (endogenously). Your body initially and TEMPORARILY increases your testosterone. Which is great.\n\nBut soon after, it all drops again back to lower levels because your body quickly does 3 things:\n\n[1] It lowers testosterone by converting it to more female hormones, such as estrogen. This causes fat again, depression, and \u201cman\u201d boobs.\n\n[2] It also lowers testosterone by converting it to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) \u2013 this accelerates balding, extra body hair, and prostate problems.\n\n[3] Finally, there\u2019s an increase in stress and adrenal hormones, such as cortisol.\n\nAnd each of these 3 \u201cconversions\u201d, further lowers the testosterone back to \u201clow\u201d levels again.\n\nSo, not only are back to having \u201clow\u201d testosterone again like you originally did. But now you have an even BIGGER problem \u2014 HIGH estrogen, DHT and stress hormones!!!\n\nTHIS is now the reason you are at a higher risk for health problems.\n\nSo the solution is that you need to REDUCE the conversion to these 3 \u201cnegative\u201d hormones.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to block them completely because they are needed and have important roles. You just want to \u201clower\u201d them.\n\nThe real problem is that 99% of doctors don\u2019t do this and don\u2019t know how to do this and the truth is, they don\u2019t really even care because it\u2019s very complicated.\n\nIf taking testosterone injections, you\u2019d have to take drugs that also inhibit estrogen, DHT and cortisol. Not only does this get very expensive, but all of these drugs also have their own problems and negative side effects.\n\nYou can also take supplements that do this \u2013 the benefit is, no negative side effects. Unfortunately, it can get complicated and very expensive because you\u2019ll need to take like 6-8 different herbs and minerals to reduce these \u201cnegative aging\u201d hormones.\n\nAnd THIS is the problem I ran into myself almost 20 years ago.\n\nHow do I increase testosterone levels AND keep them high, while DECREASING the negative, \u201canti-testosterone\u201d, \u201caging\u201d hormones that I just mentioned?\n\nConsidering I\u2019m an anti-aging, endocrinology \u201chormone\u201d doctor \u2013 I had to find an easier and more effective solution and after a few months of testing, I finally did.\n\nYou can get the details and use the same formula my clients and I use, by clicking the link below.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to discuss popular medications for Erectile Dysfunction (ED), pros, cons and important health warnings. I\u2019ll quickly cover how they work, how you can make them work BETTER and lastly, natural alternatives.\n\nPDE-5 (Phosphodiesterase type 5) Inhibitors\n\nSo the first type of drugs I\u2019ll discuss, also happens to be the most popular and these are PDE-5 inhibitors, such as Viagra (sildenafil), Cialis (tadalafil) and Levitra (vardenafil).\n\nSimply stated, these drugs work by relaxing your muscles and boosting blood flow to your penis, making erections easier to get and maintain. They also work by increasing nitric oxide (NO) levels.\n\nThe main difference between these 3 drugs is the \u201chalf-life\u201d, which is basically how quickly these drugs work and stop working.\n\nViagra works the fastest, in about 30 minutes and lasts about 4 hours. While Cialis is the slowest \u2014 takes about an hour or two to start working, but lasts about 2 days. Thus, known as the \u201cweekender\u201d pill.\n\nThe biggest problem with these drugs is they do NOTHING for improving your sex drive and libido. Taking these drugs alone will not cause an erection. They must be taken in combination with some form of sexual stimulation.\n\nAnother common problem with these drugs is side effects such as low blood pressure, which is the original REASON these drugs were made. In fact, \u201cerections\u201d are a side benefit of these drugs.\n\nThere are other problems such as vision, sinus, and headaches.\n\nLastly, the lower your testosterone levels \u2013 your primary \u201csex drive\u201d hormone \u2013 the LESS effective these drugs are. In fact, this is the primary reason they don\u2019t work in about 25% of users, especially \u201colder\u201d guys who need it the most \u2026 Because they have \u201clow\u201d testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a way to make these drugs work better and I\u2019ll show you how in a minute.\n\nNext is one of the least popular and that\u2019s injections into your penis. A typical one is Caverject, which is a prostaglandin (PGE-1).\n\nSimilar to the PDE-5 drugs, the shot increases blood flow to your penis. The results are instant and you do NOT need any kind of arousal for your penis to get hard.\n\nUnfortunately, not too many guys want to put a needle into their penis. And if you don\u2019t do it correctly or take too much, your erection will just not go away for a long time and can actually cause tissue damage.\n\nThis is best used when nothing else has worked and typically, for guys who have blood vessel problems.\n\nIncreasing Testosterone Levels\n\nMy personal favorite, healthiest, and most long-term and \u201cpermanent\u201d solution to erectile dysfunction is increasing your testosterone levels.\n\nThe main benefit here, as stated earlier, is that testosterone is your primary \u201clibido\u201d hormone \u2013 in both men and women. It improves BOTH your physical and emotional sex drive.\n\nHigher testosterone also helps support healthy blood flow and nitric oxide levels, similar to Viagra.\n\nHigher testosterone also reduces health problems (heart, blood sugar, etc.)\n\nIf you want to feel and look younger, testosterone is the primary way to do it.\n\nHow To Increase Your Testosterone Levels?\n\nNow, there are 2 ways to increase testosterone:\n\nThe first is \u201cExogenously\u201d \u2013 which means from \u201cexternal factors\u201d, such as testosterone injections, creams, pellets, pills, etc.\n\nThe problem here is that there are a lot of factors that need to be controlled \u2013 primarily the \u201cnegative\u201d conversion of testosterone to the female hormone, estrogen \u2014 which means \u201cman boobs\u201d, body fat.\n\nThe second \u201cnegative\u201d conversion is testosterone to DHT \u2013 the hair loss and prostate oroblems hormone.\n\nBoth of these require ADDITIONAL drugs to be taken with your testosterone.\n\nUnfortunately, 99% of doctors are CLUELESS about the endocrine/hormonal system and thus, taking testosterone will end up causing MORE harm than good in the long run.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that this is a lifelong commitment. You can\u2019t take testosterone \u201csometimes\u201d. It\u2019s all or nothing, for the rest of your life.\n\nOh, one other negative side-effect \u2014 your testicles will shrink! But don\u2019t worry, nothing will happen to your penis.\n\nThe second way to increase your testosterone is \u201cEndogenously\u201d \u2013 which means from \u201cinternal\u201d factors. And this is done through eating specific foods, doing certain exercises and taking special herbs, vitamins and minerals.\n\nThis is the BEST way to increase your testosterone because it\u2019s natural, totally safe, and long-term.\n\nNo needles, no prescriptions and it\u2019s much cheaper.\n\nTruth is, THIS is where you should start, before doing anything else.\n\nOne other cool benefit, higher testosterone makes using drugs like Viagra and Cialis work much better and you can use a lower dose too.\n\nAnyway, today\u2019s topic was about ED \u201cmedications\u201d and thus, I\u2019m going to end it here.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "\"Increase My Libido & Testosterone\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb As you may already know, testosterone is the primary hormone that controls your libido, \u201cdrive\u201d, mental happiness, muscle mass, belly fat and an overall improved sense of well-being.\n\nUnfortunately, over 95-98% of your \u201ctotal\u201d testosterone is \u201cbound\u201d to various proteins in your blood. So most of it is \u201cinactive\u201d.\n\nThus, only 5% or less is \u201cfree\u201d to travel around your body and work it\u2019s magic.\n\nThink of your \u201ctotal\u201d testosterone as your GROSS income and your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone as your NET income \u2014 the money you get to keep after all your expenses and taxes.\n\nOf course, you want to increase your testosterone levels. However, what we care most about is increasing your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels, which is what Stinging Nettle Extract can help with.\n\nStinging nettle is an herb that gets its name from the fact that its leaves and stems are coated with tiny stinging hairs, which can cause irritation to the skin.\n\nStinging nettle helps optimize your testosterone levels by 3 main actions:\n\nBinding with sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), freeing up the \u201cbounded\u201d testosterone and thus, increasing your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels.\n\nInhibiting aromatase, an enzyme which converts testosterone to estrogen. As men get older and the higher your body fat, the more estrogen you have. Which is NOT what you want, because estrogen tells your body to reduce testosterone production.\n\nInhibiting 5a-reductase, an enzyme which converts testosterone to its metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This is the hormone that causes balding, body hair and enlarged prostate. Similar to estrogen, as DHT goes up, your testosterone comes down.\n\nThese 3 methods are extremely important for improving your testosterone and keeping it high long-term. This is why Stinging nettle is one of my favorite herbs.\n\nSide-Effects & Warnings\n\nThe problem is most products on the market contain Stinging nettle \u201croot\u201d powder, which is for the most part, dead and inactive. What you care about with herbs is the EXTRACT amount.\n\nThe higher the extract, the higher the active ingredients, the higher the concentration and thus, the MORE EFFECTIVE it is.\n\nUnfortunately, it also costs a lot more.\n\nSo, don\u2019t use cheap or inferior products because you won\u2019t get any results or you\u2019ll have to take a much higher dosage and thus, you\u2019re basically wasting time and money.\n\nThe most effective is about a 95% extract or 50:1 ratio.\n\nHow To Make It Work Better\n\nResearch has shown that to make Stinging Nettle work better, you want to \u201cstack\u201d it with other complementary ingredients, which will help\n\nIncrease testosterone \u2013 both total and free.\n\nReduce \u201cadaptation\u201d, so you get better results with lower dosages\n\nPrevent \u201cconversions\u201d to negative hormones, so you can KEEP your testosterone high.\n\nAnd to do this, you should take Stinging nettle with synergistic ingredients such as:\n\nFenugreek, Tongkat Ali, Avena Sativa, Stinging Nettle and Tribulus extract, for optimal testosterone levels.\n\nDIM and Selenium to reduce the female hormone, estrogen\n\nVitamin C and Ashwagandha to reduce the stress hormone, cortisol\n\nVitex Agnus to reduce the female hormone, prolactin\n\nZinc to reduce the hair loss and prostate cancer hormone, DHT\n\nThe special synergy between these correct \u201cstack of ingredients\u201d, creates a much safer and more effective solution.\n\nIt\u2019s like 1+1+1 = 6 (not 3!)\n\nYou use less, and you get more.\n\nThe \u201cstack\u201d saves you money and gives you better, safer results, for a longer amount of time.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to go out and get all of these different ingredients. I\u2019ve simplified all of this for you.\n\nThere\u2019s a link below to a special bonus video about this topic with more details, the exact formula I personally use for boosting testosterone levels, increasing libido, muscle mass and decreasing belly fat.\n\nStinging nettle primarily works by binding to SHBG and increasing your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels.\n\nWhen selecting a Stinging nettle product, make sure it contains the most effective extract concentration (95% or 50:1 ratio)\n\nMake sure you combine it with other key ingredients, which will optimize your pro-testosterone hormones for the correct, \u201cyouthful\u201d balance.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

But only about 3-4x weekly and less than 1 hour at a time. Thus, you only need 4 hours total a week. Too much causes a DROP in testosterone.\n\nKeep intense cardio to a minimum because it lowers testosterone and increases negative hormones. Thus, no running, jogging, biking. A brisk walk for 30 mins daily is great.\n\nEat more healthy fats, natural fats in the raw form. Eat raw nuts, seeds, egg yolks, grass feed butter, macadamia nut oil, avocados and coconut oil. Do NOT heat your oils. Don\u2019t cook with them. Don\u2019t eat any of the typical \u201csupermarket\u201d oils.\n\nGet more sleep and rest. This is when you produce your good hormones and reduce the bad ones. Take a short nap if you can. Set time aside daily to rest for 20-30 min \u2013 even if it\u2019s meditation or listening to relaxing music.\n\nTake herbs and vitamins that are clinically proven to increase your \u201ctotal\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels\u2026 such as Horny Goat Weed Extract (20% Icarrin), Avena Sativa Extract (10:1), Longjack Extract (Eurycoma 100:1) and Vitamin D3.\n\nThese are five, clinically proven solutions that you can implement right away to see improvements in how you look and feel.\n\nNext Challenge \u2013 KEEPING It High\n\nHowever, increasing your testosterone is just the start.\n\nThe real challenge is to KEEP it high and prevent it from dropping.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s continue with the most well-known hair loss hormone, DHT.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Improving Your Hormones & Reversing + Avoiding HAIR LOSS\n\nAs you get older, starting in your mid 20's (yup, that early!)... you start to have negative changes in your hormones, such as:\n\nlower male hormones (total and free testosterone, DHEA, etc.)\n\nhigher female hormones (estrogens, prolactin, etc.)\n\nhigh stress hormones (cortisol, adrenalin, DHT, etc.)\n\nAll of these negative hormonal changes can lead to less muscle, more belly fat, a decrease in libido and HAIR LOSS!\n\nAnd the secret is to reverse the negative hormonal changes, so you can have similar healthy & youthful levels like you did in your teenage years and early 20's - when you were NOT having any of these negative problems.\n\nThe best part is you can do this naturally - discover how...",

    "content": "If you\u2019ve been following me for some time, you know that I have a family history of heart health problems \u2013 especially on my dad\u2019s side of the family.\n\nNow, I\u2019m sharing this with you because the other day I had my uncle and aunt over for dinner and they saw me eat a big tablespoon of coconut oil and then proceeded to freak out and say \u201cwhat are you doing, that\u2019s all saturated fats \u2013 don\u2019t you know that\u2019s going to raise your cholesterol and give you a heart attack and stroke?!!\u201d\n\nOf course, they are completely wrong \u2013 however, this is how most people think\u2026\n\nThat saturated fats are horrible for you!!?!\n\nAnd this false information and myth all started in the 1950s by a guy named Ancel Keys. He basically did a study of 6 countries in which higher saturated fat intake equated to higher rates of heart disease.\n\nUnfortunately, like most studies that are skewed, he purposely ignored and DELETED data on the 16 other countries that didn\u2019t fit his theory.\n\nCountries where high saturated fat intake showed very little heart disease. And also countries with very little fat showed HIGH rates of heart disease. Basically, the real data showed nothing of any value. The data was all over the place!\n\nHowever, once his paper was published and he was on the cover of Time magazine, the medical industry changed and saturated fats became the devil.\n\nSadly, new, supposedly \u201chealthier\u201d fats emerged \u2014 such as sunflower, corn, soybean, and cottonseed oils\u2026. and margarine \u2013 let\u2019s not forget about this junky fat.\n\nIronically, THESE fats have contributed more to heart health problems than most other foods and certainly a lot more than saturated fats.\n\nAnd this is because these so-called \u201chealthy\u201d fats are high in inflammatory omega 6 fats. Plus, when heated, the fat molecule oxidizes, changes structure, and becomes hydrogenated so basically, TOXIC to your body.\n\nThese vegetable and seed fats are NOT designed to be heated, while saturated fats are.\n\nYet, a major meta-analysis of 21 studies with almost 350,000 adults, revealed no difference in the risks of heart health problems between people with the lowest and highest intakes of saturated fat.\n\nAnd there are other, major studies showing similar results.\n\nSimply stated, eating saturated fats does NOT cause heart problems!\n\nEat More Saturated Fats\n\nActually, the truth is that eating saturated fats can actually help prevent heart problems. This is because they reduce levels of Lipoprotein (a) [LP(a)], which has a very strong correlation to heart disease.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that there are no drugs currently that lower Lipoprotein (a), but saturated fats do!\n\nAgain, nature already has the solutions.\n\nAdditionally, eating saturated fats helps increase your \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol (lipoprotein).\n\nThat\u2019s a double positive bonus!\n\nAnd there are other benefits too.\n\nWeight Loss \u2013 Saturated fats, especially coconut oil, can help you lose fat by increasing your metabolism and thyroid.\n\nHealthier Brain \u2013 The brain is made largely of fat and the majority of the fat in the brain is saturated.\n\nHealthier Liver \u2013 Saturated fats also encourage the liver cells to dump their fat content \u2013 this is a primary step in stopping that unhealthy and ugly belly fat. Additionally, saturated fat has been shown to protect the liver from the toxicity of alcohol and medication drugs.\n\nStronger Bones \u2013 They also help make your bones stronger, especially in women. Vegetable oils do the opposite and cause osteoporosis.\n\nStronger Immune System \u2013 Saturated fats, especially coconut oil is amazing for your immune system. The myristic and lauric acid have antibacterial and antifungal qualities for your gut. In fact, these are also found in high amounts in human breast milk as a potent germ-killing ability for the baby.\n\nHealthier Lungs -For proper function, the airspaces of the lungs have to be coated with a thin layer of what\u2019s called lung surfactant. The fat content of lung surfactant is 100 percent saturated fatty acids. Replacement of these critical fats by other types of fat makes faulty surfactant and potentially causes breathing difficulties (such as asthma) and inflammation.\n\nHealthier Skin \u2013 Saturated fats, especially coconut also reduces inflammation, hydrates the skin and increases collagen \u2013 all of which are needed for healthier, more youthful skin.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid of saturated fats, assuming you eat the right kinds.\n\nIf you get them from animal products, the best are pasture-raised Bison and whole eggs.\n\nYou can also get it from dairy, such as butter \u2013 but I\u2019m not a fan of dairy. I believe milk is for babies and COW milk is for BABY COWS.\n\nAnd one of the best-saturated fats is coconut oil, which by the way, contains NO cholesterol, despite what most people think.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re concerned about your cholesterol levels \u2013 if you have high cholesterol, improve your diet, exercise, and take natural herbs.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=2%20Am%20J%20Clin%20Nutr\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Archives+of+internal+medicine%22%5BJour%5D+AND+1371%5Bpage%5D+AND+1992%5Bpdat%5D&cmd=detailssearch\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/91/3/502/4597078\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7858908\n\nhttp://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/25/3/553.short\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527399001072",

    "title": "First & Biggest Sign Of Zinc Deficiency & Symptoms",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/first-biggest-sign-of-zinc-deficiency-symptoms/",
    "content": "About a year ago I did a super popular video about Zinc and how it improves your testosterone levels, libido, and so forth.\n\nSo then came all the comments and questions.\n\nThat led to another video about the Top 10 Benefits of Zinc.\n\nThen the Best Type & Form of Zinc\n\nBest Time To Take Zinc\n\nAnd finally, the 3 Best Foods Highest in Zinc\n\nSo, I figured I had covered it all.\n\nHowever, someone asked me a super important question about Zinc the other day in the comments section. He asked:\n\nDr. Sam \u2013 how do I know if I need to take zinc? If I\u2019m deficient in it? What are the symptoms? What\u2019s the biggest or first sign a person might be zinc deficient?\n\nWell, this is a great question and it looks like I didn\u2019t address it in the previous videos, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be quickly talking about today.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s quickly go over some deficiency stats posted by the NIH (National Institute of Health).\n\nAs high as 50% of adults are deficient in zinc. This is really bad.\n\nAbout 35%-45% have low levels, only 50% of the RDA\u2019s recommendations.\n\nAnd the people taking supplements, a shocking 25% of adults STILL had \u201cinadequate zinc intake\u201d\n\nMind you, these are not even OPTIMAL levels \u2013 these are the bare minimum to get by and survive!\n\nHow Do You Know If YOU Are Deficient\n\nSo based on the stats, let\u2019s assume most people do NOT have optimal levels of zinc. And the stats show that the older you are, the more deficient you become, especially after the age of 50.\n\nDoing blood tests typically isn\u2019t very accurate and is obviously an inconvenience for most of us because of time and money.\n\nSo, all we can do is see what SYMPTOMS you may have, that can be potentially linked to zinc deficiency.\n\nThe problem is that Zinc is involved and required as a catalyst for approximately 100 enzymatic reactions.\n\nit plays a vital role in immune function\n\nprotein synthesis \u2026 which is related to muscle growth, skin, hair and so forth.\n\nAs well as important DNA synthesis, and cell division.\n\nZinc also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence.\n\nIt\u2019s also required for a proper sense of taste and smell.\n\nLastly, daily intake of zinc is required to maintain a steady state because the body has no specialized zinc storage system\u2026 unlike fats, carbohydrates, and proteins, which your body CAN store.\n\nThus, zinc is linked to so many health issues that the deficiency can be hard to pinpoint.\n\nBecause of this, I\u2019m going to list PRIMARY and then secondary symptoms because there is no ONE specific one that\u2019s more important than any other.\n\nRemember, the human body is super complex and there are like a million different things happening at once.\n\nSo, if anyone ever tells you there\u2019s ONE specific reason or cause for some issue with the body \u2013 they are ignorant and misinformed. Don\u2019t listen to them.\n\nLowered sex drive, especially for men\n\nHair loss \u2026 both men and women\n\nDecrease sense of smell & taste, which can lead to a loss of appetite\n\nPoor immune system\u2026 you get sick often, colds, etc.\n\nFeeling fatigued, tired, less alert\n\nWhite spots on your nails or even brittle, weak nails\n\nIf you have any of these, especially more than 2 or 3 of the primary ones, I highly recommend you consider taking additional zinc.\n\nEven if you aren\u2019t deficient in zinc, chances are you do NOT have OPTIMAL levels.\n\nBalance Zinc With Copper\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve seen my previous videos, I stated that zinc should be balanced with copper.\n\nI typically take the patented Zinmax\u00ae Zinc Picolinate at 20 mg daily + 3 mg of Copper. The ratio should be around 10:1\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling sick, I double or even triple the dose.\n\nThe good news is that I\u2019ve included both of these in AlphaViril at the correct dosages, which also includes other natural ingredients for boosting testosterone, balancing hormones, and dramatically increasing your libido and sexual performance.\n\nEither way, make sure you add it to your daily supplement intake because Zinc + Copper has far too many health, fitness, and longevity benefits for you to ignore.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8083574?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttp://search.nap.edu/nap-cgi/de.cgi?term=Dietary+Reference+Intakes+for+Vitamin+A%2C+Vitamin+K%2C+Arsenic%2C+Boron%2C+Chromium%2C+Copper%2C+Iodine%2C+Iron%2C+Manganese%2C+Molybdenum%2C+Nickel%2C+Silicon%2C+Vanadium%2C+and+Zinc.&x=13&y=10\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9481116?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7749260?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8835055?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3868917?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16632171?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9010918?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11115789?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12421862?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttp://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/fanrr36/fanrr36.pdf",

    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is extremely important for anyone who wants to improve their sex drive, increase libido, get harder, longer-lasting erections, and finally fix erectile dysfunction or impotency, once and for all\u2026 and do so, naturally.\n\nOh, an added bonus is you\u2019ll look and feel younger too \u2013 more muscle, less body fat, and increased energy levels.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions about this topic. Today is going to be a short summary for anyone who\u2019s in a rush.\n\nHow To Look And Feel Younger\n\nNow, the secret to doing this is to optimize your youthful hormones, which is important for anyone over the age of 25 and certainly if you\u2019re 40 and over.\n\nAnd I know this because my area of study as a doctor is anti-aging medicine and endocrinology \u2013 which is the study of hormones.\n\nNow, most people, experts, doctors, and natural products all emphasize that you must increase your testosterone \u2013 the primary \u201csex drive\u201d hormone in both men and women.\n\nUnfortunately, this is only the start and if this is all you did (increase testosterone), you\u2019d actually cause more harm than good. In fact, this is why almost all \u201ctestosterone boosting\u201d products don\u2019t work or only work for a couple of weeks \u2013 because your body quickly adapts when you only focus on \u201cincreasing your testosterone.\u201d\n\nWhat you want is to optimize numerous hormones at the same time, so you have the same hormonal ratios and amounts to when you were a teenager and you looked, felt, and performed the best.\n\nHere\u2019s What You Need To Do\n\nThe first thing you want to do is increase your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone levels, in addition to your \u201ctotal\u201d testosterone.\n\nBasically, think of your total testosterone as your gross income and your \u201cfree\u201d testosterone as your NET income \u2014 the money you keep after expenses and taxes.\n\nBoth should be high, but what matters most is your free testosterone or your, \u201cnet\u201d income.\n\nThe second thing you need to do is lower negative, \u201canti-testosterone\u201d hormones.\n\nEstrogen \u2013 the female hormone is one of them. As this goes up, your testosterone goes down. Also, the ratio matters because most men over the age of 35 start to become more estrogen dominant, and thus, they feel and act less \u201cmanly\u201d \u2013 including in the bedroom. They become more emotional and less driven.\n\nProlactin \u2013 this is another female hormone that goes up as you age. The lower it is, the more often and more frequently you can get an erection and orgasm \u2013 similar to when you were a teenager.\n\nCortisol \u2013 next you want to lower the stress hormone, cortisol. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 we live in a stressful world. And when cortisol is higher, your body will temporarily shut down testosterone levels so that you can survive. But since we are under constant stress \u2013 your testosterone is constantly minimized due to the increased cortisol and stress hormones.\n\nDopamine \u2013 This is not a hormone, but a neurotransmitter. However, it\u2019s a powerful emotional stimulatory of sex drive and libido. Sadly, because of the internet, porn, caffeine, alcohol, and various drugs, and of course aging \u2014 most people\u2019s dopamine production has dramatically decreased AND receptor sensitivity is also minimized. This kills your \u201cdrive\u201d \u2014 both emotionally and sexually.\n\nNitric Oxide / Blood Flow \u2013 finally, by optimizing the hormones that I\u2019ve mentioned today and also taking some specific supplements, you\u2019ll improve your nitric oxide levels which increases blood flow to the penis and clitoris. This is, in fact, how drugs like Cialis and Viagra work. Unfortunately, these drugs have side effects and they don\u2019t work in 40% of the users \u2013 ironically, the older you are the less they work \u2013 and that\u2019s when you need it the most.\n\nAs you can see, this can get complicated. And of course, this is why it\u2019s so hard to fix erectile dysfunction and increase your testosterone and libido, and more importantly, KEEP IT HIGH so your body doesn\u2019t adapt.\n\nYou could try my favorite solution, which helps optimize and maximize your youth hormones for better erections, mood, muscle mass, fat loss, and many other \u201cyouthful\u201d benefits\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

As we get older and less testosterone is produced by the testicles and ovaries, your adrenal glands get pressured into trying to produce more to compensate for the massive loss.\n\nThis is why you want to optimize production by the testicles, especially in men since we need so much more of it.\n\nTestosterone is highest in the morning and lowest and lowest later in the day.\n\nIn the undersurface of the brain, the hypothalamus releases a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH).\n\nThis signals the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain, to produce LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone).\n\nLH & FSH travel down, through the bloodstream, to your gonads and stimulate the production and release of testosterone and sperm in men.\n\nYour body wants balance. Homeostasis.\n\nHow do I increase my testosterone naturally, and keep it high so I can have a higher libido, more muscle mass, less body fat, more energy, and be in a happier mood?\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that you can safely and naturally optimize your hormones at any age.

Then hair loss can stop and even reverse.\n\nObviously, you don\u2019t want to castrate yourself.\n\nThis last point is that DHT is probably the worst hormone for the scalp and one of the biggest causes of hair loss.\n\nSo what\u2019s the best solution for you to still have a high libido and sex drive, feel good, have more muscle and less belly fat while reducing your chances of balding?\n\nNaturally, increase your testosterone levels within the normal range.\n\nNaturally, decrease DHT levels within a normal range.\n\nNaturally, decrease excess levels of estrogens and stress hormones.\n\nWhat you do NOT want to do is kill off your DHT and/or testosterone levels.

They also boost nitric oxide levels.\n\nThey are vasodilators and serve the same function and that\u2019s to increase blood flow.\n\nThis CAN mean better erections for some men.\n\nViagra is fast-acting. It takes about 15-45 minutes to start working and will last about 4-12 hours based on the dosage.\n\nMost of the effects wear off in about 4-5 hours.\n\nViagra needs to be taken on an empty stomach. Ideally about 2 hours after a meal or an hour before a meal.\n\nI always suggest starting with the lowest, which is 25 mg.\n\nCialis is the longest-acting PDE-5 inhibitor. It takes about 30-60 minutes to take effect and lasts about 24-36 hours.\n\nThis one can be taken with food, even though it does work better on an empty stomach.\n\nCialis usually comes in 20 mg tablets. Again, start low, like 5 mg.\n\nLevitra is in the middle of Viagra and Cialis. It lasts a little longer than Viagra by 2-5 hours, but much shorter than Cialis.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t even see the point of this drug.\n\nWhich One I Should Choose?\n\nIf you know for sure you\u2019re going to have sex and want fast results, then take Viagra.\n\nJust take it at least 30 minutes before sex\u2026 Up to even 1-2 hours is fine too since it\u2019ll be in your system for at least 3-4 hours.\n\nRemember, take it on an empty stomach and start low \u2013 25 mg is fine.\n\nKeep in mind that because Viagra is fast-acting, the side effects are also more pronounced.\n\nCialis is best used if you\u2019re not sure if or when you\u2019re going to have sex.\n\nYou\u2019ll take Cialis earlier in the day, \u201cjust in case\u201d you get lucky. It\u2019s like \u201cinsurance\u201d.\n\nCialis\u2019 side effects are the same as Viagra, but since it\u2019s slower acting, the negatives are more subtle.\n\nSome people have asked if they can mix Viagra with Cialis?\n\nYes, you can. But for sure use a lower dose of both, since there\u2019s an additive effect.\n\nThe Big Problem With These Drugs\n\nThese drugs don\u2019t work in about 45% of men.\n\nAnd the older you are, the less effective they are.\n\nThe higher your testosterone levels and the better your hormonal balance, the better these drugs work.\n\nIn fact, IF you had optimal hormonal balance, and higher total and free testosterone levels, you wouldn\u2019t even need these drugs.\n\nAnd if you did use them, they would work much better at a lower dose and thus, fewer negative side effects.\n\nWhen you have optimal hormonal balance and testosterone levels, you\u2019ll perform better in bed, have harder, fuller erections, have a higher libido and sex drive, feel more confident, and be in a better positive mood.\n\nThese drugs work for mechanical reasons. They do nothing for increasing libido or sex drive. They do NOT fix the real problem.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t optimize your testosterone levels NOW, things will only get worse as you get older, and eventually, these drugs won\u2019t work at all.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

That\u2019s the primary goal.\n\nAs your testosterone increases and you get all the great benefits such as more muscle, less belly fat, more energy, higher libido, better erections, and so forth\u2026\n\nVarious hormonal and enzymatic changes happen to eventually STOP this increase because your body wants balance. It doesn\u2019t want things to get too high.\n\nSo, your body will cause the extra testosterone to convert to more \u201cnegative\u201d hormones such as female hormones like various estrogens or to DHT \u2013 the hair loss, prostate growing hormone.\n\nThis will drop testosterone.\n\nLuckily, AlphaViril deals with all of these issues by reducing the conversions. This is why AlphaViril works so much better than other products.\n\nIt\u2019s formulated by an endocrinology hormone doctor.\n\nHowever, other factors also happen \u2013 SHBG will change, free testosterone levels will change, receptor downgrades, stress hormones increase, and so on and so forth.\n\nAs awesome as AlphaViril is, it can\u2019t fight the human body\u2019s primary goal \u2013 to adapt and survive.\n\nSo the solution with AlphaViril is to cycle it.

I say \u201cprobably\u201d because genetics plays a big role here.\n\nIf you have a deeper voice as I do, most likely you also probably have more androgen receptors on the vocal cords and thus, more sensitivity to testosterone.\n\nTestosterone also converts to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which is even more androgenic than testosterone. Androgens are related to male characteristics \u2013 such as facial hair and a deeper voice.\n\nMedically speaking, the larynx, or voice box, is a hormone-dependent organ. In teenage boys, increased testosterone production causes the vocal cords to thicken, lengthen, and mature.\n\nThe cartilage of the larynx grows, further influencing the tone of voice. It also tilts slightly, resulting in a bump on the throat\u2014Adam\u2019s apple.\n\nFor some people, yes.

It gives more authority.\n\nBruce Wayne vs Batman\n\nIf you ever watch Batman movies, when Bruce Wayne puts on the Bat Suit and Mask, his voice all of a sudden gets deeper. This is done on purpose \u2026 to make Batman sound \u201cstronger.\u201d\n\nI mention this because the actor does this manually, which I\u2019ll tell you how in a minute.\n\nGranted, in recent movies, I think it was magnified digitally and it sounded fake.\n\nBut the point is that you too can pretend to put on your \u201cBatman Voice\u201d by using simple, \u201cvoice deepening\u201d techniques you can implement the right way, for instant results.\n\nInstantly Deeper Voice In 60 Seconds\n\nSo, the first and simple way to make your voice SOUND deeper is to\n\nSlow down when speaking\n\nSpeak more from your diaphragm and stomach, NOT from your throat\n\nFEEL more confident when speaking\n\nWhen you FEEL something, you\u2019ll ACT it.\n\nNow, you\u2019ll make instant improvements here. However, this isn\u2019t permanent. This requires practice and you being mindful every time you speak.\n\nPermanently Deeper Voice\n\nHowever, if you want to permanently deepen your voice, naturally and obviously without surgery\u2026 you need to thicken and lengthen your vocal cords.\n\nAnd the primary way this happens is with higher levels of testosterone, the male hormone.\n\nThis is why when boys go through puberty, their voices change and it gets deeper.\n\nInterestingly, this is also why women and female bodybuilders who take substances to increase testosterone, get a deeper voice \u2014 again, it all comes down to hormones.\n\nThe problem for women is that this is a PERMANENT side-effect. Their voice will stay deeper, unless they have painful surgery.\n\nHowever, this is a benefit for guys \u2013 they WANT a deeper voice\u2026\n\nExcept, if you\u2019re a singer!\n\nIn fact, I have a true story\u2026 a few years ago, I had a fairly well-known singer use my natural, Testosterone Boosting herbal product called AlphaViril. He did so to increase his sex drive, build more muscle and lose fat.\n\nHe was in his early 40\u2019s at the time.\n\nHe told me he got amazing results, except for one problem: his voice got deeper from the higher testosterone levels. So, his music started to sound different.\n\nAt the end, he said it was worth the trade-off since he liked the way he looked and felt with the higher testosterone levels from using AlphaViril. But he said he had to get a vocal coach to try and sing a similar sounding level as before.\n\nNow, over the years I\u2019ve had dozens of well-known rappers use AlphaViril for all the same benefits of having higher testosterone levels \u2014 however, they also did it because they WANTED the deeper voice because that sounds great in rapping, but not as much when you\u2019re singing.\n\nAlso, not good if you\u2019re a woman.\n\nSo there you have it. Do the vocal deepening exercises I mentioned earlier. Do them daily, practice and be mindful when speaking. This will give you some immediate benefits.\n\nHowever, for long-term, permanent deepening of your voice, you\u2019ll need to boost your testosterone levels naturally.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://timothy-judge.com/Height%20paper\u2013JAP%20published.pdf",

    "content": "Today I want to talk about NOT EATING protein so you can build more muscle or preserve muscle, while also losing body fat.\n\nThis very important topic obviously affects anyone who is trying to build muscle,\u2026 whether you\u2019re a man or a woman.\n\nBut it also affects older people, 50+ who want to preserve muscle size as they age, which is ironically, a major cause of aging and death \u2013 muscle loss!\n\nIn fact, this is why they give AIDS patients lots of steroids and testosterone, to help bulk up in muscle, so when or IF they do get sick due to an infection or illness and quickly lose a ton of muscle, there is a \u201csafety net\u201d because without that extra \u201csteroid\u201d muscle growth and weight, they would lose too much muscle and then they\u2019d die.\n\nThere also a lot of anti-aging benefits, which I\u2019ll reveal in 2 minutes.\n\nAnyway\u2026 with that said, let\u2019s get down to business.\n\nEat More Protein To Gain More Muscle!?!?\n\nGrowing up in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, I was wanting to build more muscle\u2026 And all I heard was \u201ceat more protein.\u201d Now, the first reason for this is because all of these muscle magazines were SELLING you protein powders.\n\nHowever, that aside, the reason for the increase in protein consumption is because when you increase protein intake, there\u2019s an increase in protein synthesis, leading to higher \u201cnitrogen retention\u201d, which will ultimately lead to MORE muscle and LESS body fat.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m simplifying the process\u2026 but you get the point.\n\nSo, that\u2019s what I did. I just ate more and more protein.\n\nAt one point, at a body weight of 200 lbs, I was eating 600 GRAMS of protein! That\u2019s 3x my body weight.\n\nA lot of it was with protein supplements, powders and shakes, since I just couldn\u2019t chew that much real food.\n\nIt was actually very disgusting. I felt bloated and slow. I could tell my body was under extreme stress, due to the constant fatigue.\n\nI also had a lot more joint pain and my sleep was horrible.\n\nEnd Result = NO Extra Muscle!\n\nThe end result was NO extra muscle after 3 months of torture.\n\nHowever, blood tests showed my liver and kidneys were both under a lot of stress.\n\nSo my first point is that you do NOT need that much protein.\n\nHow Much Protein Do You REALLY Need?\n\nJust keep in mind that the time you\u2019re growing the most is when you\u2019re a baby, right?\u2026 and mother\u2019s milk is only 5% protein. It\u2019s mainly carbs (sugars) and fat.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019d say the most you\u2019d ever really need is about 1 gram per pound of body weight. So, in my case, weighing about 200 lbs, I would need 200 grams.\n\nSometimes I eat much less and I have NOT lost any muscle size or gotten fatter. And I still weigh around 200 lbs and I actually have MORE muscle now, than I did when I was eating more protein and I\u2019ll tell you how and why in a minute.\n\nHowever, some people will argue that you need more protein, but trust me, you DO NOT!\n\nIF you\u2019re working out really hard 2-3 hours daily, taking LOTS of steroids and are in your 20\u2019s when you CAN absorb more protein correctly, then you can do about 1.5 grams at the MAXIMUM and thus, if 200 lbs, you can eat about 300 grams of protein.\n\nHowever, 99% of us are not in this small minority.\n\nWhy You Should Eat NO Protein!\n\nNow, there are lots of problems with eating so much protein, but the one main topic I want to discuss today is that the more protein you eat, the faster is also oxidizes and thus, BREAKS DOWN faster.\n\nSo, the \u201cexperts\u201d will say \u201cmore protein increases protein synthesis\u201d and yes it does, but for about 48-72 hours, before your body ADAPTS and it increases protein oxidation, which means it BREAKS DOWN faster and thus, protein synthesis DECREASES!!!\n\nHence, the OPPOSITE happens! You start to LOSE muscle.\n\nYour body is too smart, it will adapt every single time.\n\nSo then people increase protein even MORE and then your body breaks it DOWN even faster.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution?\n\n\u201cProtein Cycling/Fasting\u201d\n\nYou need to protein cycle by actually having one day a week with NO protein. You can call it \u201cprotein fasting.\u201d\n\nAnd trust me, you are NOT going to \u201close\u201d muscle. In fact, you\u2019ll GAIN muscle\u2026 IF you do it correctly.\n\nSo, how do you protein cycle, not eat any protein for 24 hours and actually INCREASE muscle and burn more fat and most importantly, improve your hormones?\n\nLet me tell you how I and my professional athletes do it.\n\nHere\u2019s What You Should Do\n\nSundays, I eat no protein. You can pick any ONE day out of the week, I just pick Sundays.\n\nMonday, my body is now super sensitive to protein since it\u2019s gone without it for 24 hours. So Monday and Tuesday, I have 150 grams of protein. So, that\u2019s 0.75 of 200 lbs body weight.\n\nThus, your weight (200 lbs for me) x 0.75 = 150 grams.\n\nThen Wednesday and Thursday, I increase it by 25% to 200 grams. Basically, 200 (lbs) x 1 = 200 grams of protein, or \u201cone gram per pound\u201d\n\nFinally, Friday and Saturday I again increase it by 25% since body has adapted again and this time I take in 250 grams. That\u2019s 200 (lbs) x 1.25 = 250 grams.\n\nEvery time my body adapted in about 48 hours, I again increased it to continue the additional protein synthesis.\n\nThen as my body adapts again, Sunday I trick it and do no protein\u2026. A \u201cprotein fast.\u201d\n\nAgain, you\u2019re not going to lose muscle, so don\u2019t freak out. Just trust me and do it.\n\nNow, what are the benefits?\n\nYour body continually increases protein synthesis every 48 hours, which leads to more muscle.\n\nThis prevents your body from adapting and increasing protein oxidation, which can lead to muscle loss.\n\nAnd MOST importantly, all of this works because it helps optimize your hormones by lowering cortisol and other stress hormones \u2026 and by increasing muscle building hormones such as testosterone, IGF, Gh, Insulin, thyroid and so forth.\n\nOf course, this \u201cprotein fasting\u201d also has many health benefits such as a reduction in inflammation, which means more muscle, less joint pain and faster fat loss.\n\nThis also improves digestion and improves cellular repair for your pancreas, liver, kidneys and so forth.\n\nIt increases mitochondrial function and increases energy levels.\n\nActually, I can go on and on \u2013 but I hope you get it.\n\nSo now that you have the formula, you need to implement it.\n\nIt\u2019ll take a few months for you to see results, since building muscle takes time. Of course, some of the health benefits of improved digestion, reduction inflammation, more energy and so forth are felt much sooner.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "I got an email this week from Thomas about alcohol and testosterone. A question that I get asked often. Thomas writes:\n\n\u201cDoc \u2014 how bad is alcohol for my testosterone levels? I mean, I know it\u2019s not good for health, but I don\u2019t drink that much. These days, mainly on the weekends \u2013 like 2-3 drinks at the most. Well, maybe more at times (lol). But the reason I ask is because I notice it\u2019s affecting my sex drive and my \u201chardness\u201d. When I was younger, it wasn\u2019t a problem, but for sure now. Is it the alcohol or just me getting older? Oh, I\u2019m 36 by the way.\u201d\n\nFirst, yes\u2026 aging has a lot to do with it because a man\u2019s testosterone starts to drop in his mid 20\u2019s. Since you\u2019re in your mid 30\u2019s at age 36, your testosterone has been slowly lowering for the past decade.\n\nHowever, the alcohol is just making things much worse and causing a FASTER drop in your testosterone levels and thus\n\nit\u2019s killing your sex drive\n\nand basically turning you into a woman!\n\nLet me tell you the 3 primary ways it\u2019s doing this:\n\nAlcohol is a toxin \u2013 both to your body (liver, muscles, etc.) and your mind (neurons, synapses, etc.). As your body tries to metabolize alcohol (ethanol), it lowers the amount of NAD+ inside your liver and testes. This reduces the production of testosterone. The higher the quantity and frequency of alcohol usage, the lower the production of testosterone.1\n\nAlcohol stimulates the brain to release beta-opioid endorphins, which is the reason why you get really relaxed after few beers. Sadly, those endorphins are also notorious for their negative effect on testosterone synthesis.2\n\nAlcohol also causes an increase in your estrogen levels, which signals your testes to produce less testosterone.3 This also causes more belly fat, which indirectly produces even more estrogen. Thus, turning you into a \u201cgirly man\u201d.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not here to tell you to never drink. This is your life, your body, your future.\n\nMy suggestion is to reduce the consumption of alcohol whenever possible.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to drink, try to avoid beer because it tends to lower your testosterone the most due to the hops in the beer \u2026 They are very estrogenic and thus, causing the biggest imbalance between your male and female hormones.\n\nAnd lastly, the older you get, the bigger the problem alcohol is for your testosterone levels, as well as your overall health.\n\nBut if you want to continue drinking, at the very least \u2013 make sure you take testosterone boosting herbs, vitamins and minerals every day, to help undo the damage from the alcohol consumption \u2026 especially if you\u2019re over the age of 30.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3593480\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11912073\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11163119",

    "content": "Let\u2019s be honest, almost every man wants a harder, fuller and bigger erection\u2026 Especially as we get older.\n\nBy the way guys, most women don\u2019t necessarily want a \u201chuge\u201d penis\u2026\n\nHowever, every woman DOES want a super hard erection because it lets her know that you\u2019re interested and thus, you\u2019re attracted to her.\n\nWhen you can\u2019t get \u201chard\u201d or you go \u201csoft\u201d after a while, it probably has nothing to do with her.\n\nUnfortunately, she\u2019ll take it personally and then it causes stress on the relationship which then makes your \u201cperformance\u201d even worse.\n\nSo let\u2019s fix this potential \u201cchallenge\u201d right now.\n\nLet me reveal 5 simple, very effective and clinically proven solutions for you to quickly achieve harder, fuller and even bigger erections.\n\nWhat you put or don\u2019t put in your body, affects your hormones and blood flow, which directly influences your ability to get and maintain an erection.\n\nEat more- such as coconut, avocado, macadamia nut and extra virgin olive oil \u2026 and for sure, some whole eggs from pasture raised chicken.\n\nAll of this will create much higher testosterone levels, which means higher sex drive and better erections.\n\nYou\u2019ll noticed I didn\u2019t say exercise \u201cmore\u201d because too much exercise, increases your stress hormone cortisol and lowers your testosterone.\n\nLift weights, 3-4x weekly \u2013 no more than 45-60 minutes\n\nDon\u2019t do any kind of stressful cardio, such as long distance running, jogging, biking, etc. Either do quick sprints for only 10-15 minutes or better yet, go for a brisk 20-30 min walk outside, 3-4x weekly. Preferably on your \u201coff\u201d days when you\u2019re not lifting weights.\n\nAgain, you\u2019ll notice I didn\u2019t say sleep \u201cmore\u201d, even though most people ARE sleep deprived and should sleep an extra hour or two\u2026 as needed.\n\nBy sleeping better and getting into a deeper REM sleep, you\u2019ll optimize your hormones levels. And 3 simple ways to do this is:\n\nSleep before midnight, preferably around 10 PM\n\nDim the lights and wear blue blocker glasses about an hour before bed\n\nTurn OFF any electronic device near your bed. At the very least, put your phone on \u201cairplane\u201d mode to reduce electromagnetic waves\n\nAgain, it\u2019s all about optimizing your hormones.\n\nYour fat cells produce estrogen. The higher your body fat, the more estrogen your body has, which tells your testicles to produce LESS testosterone.\n\nSo little by little, your fat cells will produce HIGHER female hormones, leads to LOWER male hormones and you slowly castrate yourself and turn into a \u201cgirly man\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, modern-day foods are completely lacking in so many essential vitamins, minerals and plant extracts.\n\nSo you need to \u201cmanually\u201d replenish these essential nutrients by taking certain ingredients that\n\nIncrease \u201cpositive\u201d male hormones, such as testosterone.\n\nDecrease \u201cnegative\u201d female hormones, such as estrogens, progesterone and prolactin.\n\nReduce \u201cstress\u201d hormones, such as cortisol\n\nBoost Nitric oxide levels, which will improve blood flow and circulation.\n\nBy taking these specific nutrients, not only will you feel and look better, healthier and younger\u2026\n\nBut your \u201cperformance\u201d in the bedroom will dramatically improve, as will the fullness and size of your penis.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Hey guys\u2026 Today I\u2019m going to talk about premature ejaculation and how you can potentially fix this problem once and for all.\n\nAt very least, you\u2019ll discover 5 proven ways of reducing this \u201cembarrassing\u201d situation, from ever happening again!\n\nSo if you\u2019re feeling insecure or ashamed about this, don\u2019t worry \u2026 you\u2019re not alone, so that\u2019s the first thing I want to mention.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve read my previous article, I\u2019ve revealed proven ways for guys to improve their testosterone and libido \u2026 which is especially important for guys who have erectile dysfunction or impotence.\n\nAnd the feedback has been great and it probably explains why millions have read that popular article.\n\nHowever, I started getting a lot of private emails and questions from guys who are dealing with the opposite issue \u2013 which is about today\u2019s topic of, Premature Ejaculation.\n\nAnd the basic definition of premature ejaculation is when a guy ejaculates either before or shortly after sexual penetration or anything sexual (hand or oral). And the main issue is that there\u2019s minimal sexual stimulation and thus, the end result is dissatisfaction by BOTH partners.\n\nBasically, you \u201ccame\u201d way too early. Most guys don\u2019t feel \u201cmanly\u201d because of this. They feel they have no control over it.\n\nThey\u2019re embarrassed and ashamed and at the same time, very worried that their partner is just going to NOT have sex with them again\u2026 and will go find someone who can \u201clast longer\u201d and isn\u2019t called a \u201cminute man\u201d.\n\nBy the way, this \u201cproblem\u201d affects guys of all ages, but typically younger guys.\n\nAnd the cause is BOTH physical and psychological and I\u2019ll address both and give you PROVEN solutions, including a surprise \u201cfix\u201d that I discovered by accident a few years ago\u2026 and I\u2019ll tell you about that in a minute, near the end of this article.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started with the 5 proven solutions:\n\nPractice trying to last longer. Assuming you masturbate, as you bring yourself close to an orgasm, STOP\u2026\n\nAnd tightly pinch the head of your penis for a few seconds and that\u2019ll usually send a signal to your penis to pause and stop the ejaculation.\n\nIt\u2019ll reverse the blood flow.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking \u201chow many seconds to I pinch\u201d, it depends on the person. But at least 5-10 seconds\u2026 The goal here it so stops and reverses the blood flow.\n\n2. Non Sexual Thoughts\n\nNext thing you can do when you\u2019re getting close to an orgasm, is to think about something else\u2026 non-sexual thoughts.\n\nThink about cars, playing sports, work, cooking or my favorite \u2013 your parents! Hehe\u2026 this will typically kill the mood for anyone.\n\nRemember, your brain is the most powerful sexual organ in the body.\n\nStop focusing on the pleasure and almost detach yourself from the situation. Again, just long enough to tell your penis to STOP getting so excited.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to go overboard or else you may go limp.\n\nAgain, as you\u2019re getting close to an orgasm, stop focusing on how good it feels and start thinking about non-sexual thoughts.\n\n3. Focus On Your Partner\n\nSpeaking of thinking about something else \u2013 I want you to focus on your partner. Your only goal should be to pleasure her\u2026.\n\nKiss her, touch and massage her\u2026 play with her breasts and nipples\u2026 and really get her \u201cwarmed up\u201d.\n\nThen, focus on giving her an orgasm \u2026 but without your penis. Give her oral sex and use your tongue. Don\u2019t forget your fingers, use them as well.\n\n\u2026 I can go on and on about this topic and maybe I will in a future article if see a lot of questions about it.\n\nSimply stated, make sure you give her at least ONE orgasm, preferably more. THEN, you can go ahead and have sex with her.\n\nAt this point, IF you came too early again \u2013 she\u2019s at least been satisfied and has had an orgasm or two.\n\nPLUS, this will reduce the pressure and stress you put on yourself, so you can relax more and use the other tactics I\u2019ve mentioned so far.\n\nIf you know you\u2019re going to have sex, masturbate BEFORE. For example, if you\u2019ve got a date that night and you think you might get lucky, masturbate and have an orgasim, a few hours before the date.\n\nThis way you\u2019ve released some of your testosterone, your prolactin levels are higher, there\u2019s an increase in serotonin and other \u201cchemical\u201d changes\u2026 causes you to last much longer when you go at it later that same day.\n\n5. Improve Your Neurotransmitters\n\nFinally, you want to improve your neurotransmitters. Speaking of \u201cchemical\u201d changes\u2026 there are antidepressant drugs that work very well for premature ejaculation.\n\nSpecifically, these \u201cselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\u201d (SSRI\u2019s), have helped thousands of men improve this situation and allow them to last longer.\n\nUnfortunately, they\u2019re riddled with lots of negative side-effects and can actually cause impotence in a majority of users, not to mention a massive DROP in sex drive and libido!\u2026\n\nSo, this is definitely NOT what we want. Now earlier I said I how accidentally discovered a surprising \u201cfix\u201d to his problem.\n\nIn 1999, I formulated a great solution, that\u2019s all natural\u2026 for people who have anxiety, panic attacks, and depression.\n\nIf you have extra stress, worry a lot, have insomnia or your brain is always \u201cthinking too much\u201d, this solution really helped.\n\nIt\u2019s made a huge difference and improvement in people\u2019s lives. I mean, hundreds and thousands of customers use it daily to live happier lives.\n\nThey\u2019ve gotten off of their anti-anxiety and antidepressant drugs and I\u2019m really proud of the results and happy I\u2019ve helped so many people.\n\nHowever,\u2026 and please pay close attention\u2026 what\u2019s interesting is that over the years, I\u2019ve had a lot of guys who use this natural solution, tell me that it\u2019s \u201ccured\u201d their premature ejaculation. Or, it\u2019s helped tremendously.\n\nThey last much longer and best of all, their partner is now satisfied and happy with sex! Now, this isn\u2019t what I had designed the product for\u2026\n\nBut, it makes perfect sense because it improves your neurotransmitters, increases healthy serotonin levels, reduces stress hormones and thus \u2014 you get the benefits of the \u201cselective serotonin reuptake inhibiting\u201d drugs \u2014 which are clinically proven to help with premature ejaculation \u2026\n\nBut WITHOUT any of the negative side-effects. In fact, you feel more confident and happier. Anyway, this natural solution is called ProVanax\u2122. You can click the link below this article, to learn more about this product.\n\nHOWEVER, the webpage and video says nothing about \u201cpremature ejaculation\u201d. Remember, this is just a side benefit and something I don\u2019t tell to most people. But I think it\u2019ll really be helpful for anyone reading this article and dealing with this problem.\n\nSo, to summarize today\u2019s 5 \u201cfixes\u201d for premature ejaculation:\n\nPractice lasting longer by pinching the head of your penis, when you get close to an orgasm.\n\nHave non-sexual thoughts, when you see yourself getting too excited.\n\nFocus on your partner and make sure she has an orgasm FIRST, by using your mouth and fingers.\n\nMasturbate a few hours before having sex.\n\nImprove your neurotransmitters by using a natural solution like ProVanax\n\nI\u2019ll add in an extra one \u2013 be KIND to yourself when this happens. You\u2019re not alone. Keep practicing until you have control over this.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

So I\u2019m going to give you complete clarity about it \u2014 cause, effect and solution.\n\nSo if your sex drive or libido is low or isn\u2019t where you\u2019d like it to be\u2026 If you have difficulty getting and/or keeping an erection\u2026 If your \u201cdrive\u201d for sex or just \u201clife\u201d in general, is less and isn\u2019t what it used to be\u2026\n\nKeep reading this article because you\u2019re not alone! Let\u2019s Get Honest\u2026\n\nFirst, forget what your buddies tell you \u2013 they\u2019re lying to you!\u2026 I\u2019m a doctor and I deal with this topic all the time.\n\nCauses of Erectile Dysfunction\n\nWAY more guys have ED problems than they\u2019ll admit. It may be the \u201cnorm\u201d these days, but it\u2019s definitely NOT normal. This is because we live in a society with a LOT of stress and horrible nutrients.\n\nAll of these \u201csociety\u201d and \u201cenvironmental\u201d problems are causing guys to have impotence and low sex drive as early as in their mid 20\u2019s And the reason for this is very simple \u2014 a HORMONAL IMBALANCE!\n\nAging, stress, no nutrients in the foods, drugs, radiation from our daily life-style (phone, computer, etc.) are all causing a major DECREASE in your primary \u201cpro-sexual\u201d hormone called, TESTOSTERONE! That\u2019s the FIRST problem\u2026\n\nThe second problem is you\u2019re also dealing with an INCREASE in your \u201canti-sexual\u201d hormones, such as female hormones (estrogens, progesterone and prolactin), as well as your stress hormone, cortisol.\n\nSo basically, you\u2019re becoming \u201cchemically\u201d castrated\u2026 not good! This is why statistics also show that it\u2019s a lot more difficult to get pregnant these days, than 25 or 50 years ago.\n\nLow testosterone = low sperm volume, mobility, etc.\n\nSo the PRIMARY problem is an imbalance in your hormones\u2026.\n\nThere is also a SECONDARY problem and it has to do more with your mind and psychology. This is more true for \u201cyounger\u201d guys (less than 25), while hormones is more true for \u201colder\u201d guys (over 30+).\n\nEffects of Erectile Dysfunction\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling insecure \u2013 your penis isn\u2019t going to be working as well. Maybe you\u2019re worried about your performance, about the size of your penis, about your partner\u2019s \u201csexual past\u201d\u2026 etc., etc., etc.\n\nThese \u201cnegative thoughts\u201d cause a NEGATIVE change in your hormones and brain neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, adrenalin, etc.) \u2026 so once again, whether it\u2019s mental or physical, it\u2019s almost always HORMONAL!!!\n\nED Drugs (Viagra, Cialis, etc.)\n\nBy the way, this is why ED drugs such as Viagra and Cialis don\u2019t work in 30% of the users, because their testosterone is just too low. In fact, when you improve your \u201cpro-sexual\u201d hormones, these drugs work better and at a lower dosage.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll probably NOT need them at all \u2013 but my point is that HORMONES control everything. \u2026 so, where does that leave you?\n\nTestosterone Injections = Small Testicles\n\nForget about taking testosterone (injections, creams, etc.) or similar hormones. They work initially, but then your body figures this out and then shuts down your testicles.\n\nIn the process your testicles shrink, you\u2019ll now make ZERO testosterone of our own nature and over time the \u201ctestosterone injects\u201d stop working. Now you have to increase the dosage and use them for the rest of your life \u2014 not a good long-term solution.\n\nYou need to fix this from WITHIN, naturally. It\u2019s the ONLY safe, long-term solution.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",
