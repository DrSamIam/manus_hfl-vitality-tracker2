    "content": "Most people are not getting optimal sleep. They are either not sleeping enough or deep enough. Or long enough.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken in the past about the 5 best Proven Tips To Fall Asleep Faster & Stay Asleep Longer.\n\nHowever, an important question I received is \u201cWhat\u2019s better for sleep, magnesium or Melatonin?\u201d\n\nAnd the answer is, that neither is \u201cbetter\u201d.\n\nThey both work completely differently and the truth is, I personally use both.\n\nAt the end of this article, I\u2019ve listed the best formula for each of these.\n\nHowever, let me quickly tell you the difference and why both are needed and should be taken because the combination will cause much better AND healthier results\n\nBetter Sleep: Magnesium VS Melatonin\n\nMagnesium and melatonin have different functions in your body.\n\nMagnesium is a nutrient that regulates different body processes.\n\nMelatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep patterns.\n\nThe supplement you should take ultimately depends on your goals for sleep.\n\nHowever, I take both in addition to some other key ingredients that I\u2019ve listed at the end of this article.\n\nMagnesium helps the body relax. This nutrient reduces stress and helps you sleep longer.\n\nIn contrast, melatonin helps you get to sleep faster.\n\nBoth magnesium and melatonin can be used to treat sleep difficulties.\n\nUsing Magnesium For Sleep\n\nMagnesium has so many health benefits and sadly, most of us aren\u2019t getting enough of this amazing mineral. In fact, many of us are clearly deficient in magnesium.\n\nAs it pertains to sleep specifically, what\u2019s clear from the research is that a lack of magnesium negatively impacts sleep.\n\nLow levels of magnesium are associated with poor sleep quality and insomnia.\n\nAnxiety and depression also correlate with low magnesium levels, and both anxiety and depression can contribute to insomnia.\n\nMagnesium is associated with over 300 chemical reactions in the body.\n\nAs stated earlier, one of them is to help the body relax \u2013 both the brain, but mainly the body and muscles.\n\nGranted, not all forms of magnesium do this and can help with sleep and I\u2019ll tell you the two best forms and dosages in a minute.\n\nUsing Melatonin For Sleep\n\nMelatonin is a hormone naturally produced by the body that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. When working correctly, it increases at night time and decreases in the morning.\n\nUnfortunately, many things can interfere with melatonin production, such as:\n\nNot enough sunlight during the day.\n\nExcessive light in the evening \u2013 such as computer screens, phones, TV\u2019s, etc.\n\nGoing to bed too late \u2013 yes, ideally you\u2019d sleep before midnight and preferably around 10 pm.\n\nNot sticking to the same sleep schedule every day \u2013 and this is because melatonin and cortisol will work in different patterns.\n\nHigh stress and cortisol levels \u2013 physical or emotional\n\nJet lag and shift work.\n\nAdditionally, as we age the body produces less melatonin.\n\nUnfortunately, many people who do decide to use Melatonin, use the WRONG form and dose.\n\nMagnesium \u2013 Best Form & Dose For Sleep\n\nNow, circling back to magnesium and the best form and dose. One big problem is that there are many different forms of magnesium, such as\n\nEach has its specific goal and role.\n\nAs it pertains to improving sleep and more so, relaxing the body, the best is Glycinate \u2026 because it is easily absorbed and has a calming effect. It can help reduce feelings of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia.\n\nSome say the Threonate version is also good for sleep.\n\nEven though, it has been shown to have more benefits for brain health and cognitive function.\n\nI personally just use the Glycinate version. If you want, you can test either of the two or mix both.\n\nThe ideal dose is about 400 mg to start and takes about 30-60 minutes before bed.\n\nMelatonin \u2013 Best Form & Dose For Sleep\n\nAs far as Melatonin \u2026 the problem with regular melatonin is that it\u2019s fast-acting and can wear off in the middle of the night and then all of a sudden you wake up.\n\nSome people then just take a much higher dose to compensate for this and they wake up groggy in the morning.\n\nI use one that is both fast and slow-releasing, so it is out of your system in about 6-7 hours. So, less is needed for a more positive effect.\n\nI take 1-3 mg at bedtime, with other herbs, amino acids.\n\nThis is in ADDITION to my 400 mg of Magnesium glycinate.\n\nMelatonin is actually a very potent hormone and antioxidant. Some people take like 10-40 mg and work up to this dose for these other potential longevity benefits.\n\nHowever, I do NOT suggest this. Your body only makes like 500 mcg.\n\nTaking it orally you need a higher dose. But I think anything over 5 mg is just too much and you will feel tired and \u201cblah\u201d for many hours after waking up.\n\nHere are the best forms and ingredients I use to help me fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Deep Quality Sleep\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for improving your sleep - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with sleep!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

This wakes up your body, improves dopamine and cortisol levels, and then sets your circadian rhythm to produce melatonin, the sleep hormone, in about 16 hours.\n\nExercise Daily & Early The earlier in the day you exercise, the better. Exercise ramps up and overstimulates your nervous system and adrenal glands \u2013 producing adrenaline and cortisol. BOTH of which stimulate and wake up your body.\n\nNo Stimulants, Especially After 2 pm Stimulants like caffeine products and amphetamine-type prescription drugs, over-stimulate the nervous system and overproduce stress hormones. When stress hormones are up, melatonin \u2013 the sleep hormone, will not be released properly at night.\n\nTurn Down Lights & Temperature A simple way to slow down and relax is to dim the lights in your home, about 2 hours before bed. There are lots of reasons for this, just know that darker and cooler helps your body to get ready to relax and go to bed.\n\nGo To Bed Before Midnight Going to bed before midnight is very important for proper hormone production and deeper, quality sleep. Ideally, you\u2019d get ready for bed around 9 pm and be asleep by 10 pm.\n\nTry one or all of these and get in a habit of staying consistent with your sleep hygiene and nightly sleep regimen, just as you would do with a child.\n\nNow, many of us still need a little help with getting better sleep. We want something that works, it\u2019s easy, convenient, and does NOT have negative effects.\n\nLuckily, there are specific vitamins & herbs that will guarantee you better sleep, naturally.\n\nYou\u2019ll fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.\n\nImportant \"Deep Quality Sleep\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for improving your sleep - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort...

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness-se/what-causes-insomnia/",
    "content": "The inability to fall asleep can be caused by a wide variety of issues. It could be as simple as having caffeine in the body that hasn\u2019t been fully processed yet. There could be an underlying medical condition that could be causing problems with entering a sleep state. It could even be caused because of stress, hormone imbalances, or environmental conditions. The good news, however, is that there are several natural fixes to insomnia that can help everyone achieve a better night\u2019s sleep.\n\nThe first thing that must be addressed is the root cause of the insomnia. If someone is suffering because they are becoming overheated at night, then addressing it through meditation and calming exercises to reduce stress isn\u2019t going to help a whole lot! Each natural fix must be specifically targeted to the root cause in order to be effective. When that happens, insomnia can be quickly resolved, sometimes even that very night.\n\nIf you suffer from insomnia, then these natural fixes below can help you discover what could help you achieve the rest that you need. A chronic lack of sleep can lead to a number of additional medical issues and side effects, so addressing your insomnia right away is critical to the future of your health. Which one of these ideas could help you fall asleep faster and sleep longer starting tonight?\n\nWays to Help Insomnia Sufferers\n\nAdd Comfort One of the biggest reasons for insomnia throughout the night is a lack of comfort. People have different comfort needs, which means someone who likes a hard surface could be uncomfortable on a soft bed\u2026 or vice-versa. Maintaining the mattress you are using is critical to the sleep process, as is having effective pillows that support your head, neck, and shoulders. If you find yourself tossing and turning a lot during the night, this could very well be the reason for your insomnia.\n\nNoise Do you fall asleep with the television on every night? Maybe the radio is playing? Even the neighbor\u2019s dog barking at some squirrel in the middle of the night can cause you to wake up and stay up the rest of the night. One of the most effective ways to eliminate the noises that can really bother you is to install a white noise generator in your bedroom. Many people find that they wake up much less during the night with a generator on because there\u2019s a consistent level of noise within the bedroom or sleep environment.\n\nBathroom Breaks For some people, insomnia is caused by a perpetual filling of the bladder. There are some medical conditions that can\u2019t be helped and this will always be an issue for a small minority of people, but these wake ups can be controlled. Limit how many fluids you have within a couple hours before you go to bed. Especially avoid caffeine and alcohol because not only can both of them create insomnia because of how they affect the nervous system, but they\u2019ll also cause night urination needs that can keep you awake.\n\nAvoid Carbohydrates Insomnia is usually thought of as a bedtime problem, but the root cause of someone\u2019s insomnia could begin with their very first meal of the day. A diet that is rich in carbohydrates is going to encourage a lack of sleep because the body still has energy to burn. At lunch especially, meals that are high in carbohydrates will cause feelings of sleepiness that will later translate into insomnia. Try to include more protein with your meals to prevent over-indulging in carbs, especially when it comes to snacking periods.\n\nPractice Relaxation If stress is the primary cause of insomnia, then finding a way to relax will help to increase the odds of achieving a good night\u2019s rest. For many people, a routine of meditation, prayer, Yoga, or other spiritual fulfillment can help to relieve a good portion of the tension they are feeling. Even something as simple as taking a few deep breaths in a quiet, dark room can help your body begin the journey to relaxation. Try to get into the routine of incorporating your preferred relaxation technique at the same time each evening to maximize its benefit.\n\nHerbs The more fatigued you are, the more likely you are to suffer from insomnia. It\u2019s seems strange, but it\u2019s true. One of the most common causes of chronic fatigue is a lack of magnesium and calcium in the diet. If you are deficient, then taking supplements to resolve this issue can combat the fatigue that can cause insomnia. Be careful about how much magnesium is taken, however, because it can double as a laxative. Ultimately the goal is to work on reducing the levels of ghrelin that are in your system. Ghrelin causes hunger pangs, which causes people to eat to maintain energy levels, and then that food causes further insomnia. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n\nA Warm Bath Sometimes insomnia is caused by basic muscle tension that can\u2019t be relieved. Not everyone has a massage therapist in their home, which means the next best option is to take a warm bath for 15-20 minutes before bed. If there is a lot of muscle tension, a small amount of Epsom salts can help the relaxation process. Some people prefer to follow up their warm bath with a warm glass of milk as well.\n\nMantras People joke a lot about counting sheep to fall asleep, but there is some truth to the practice. Mantras help to provide a unification of the mind and it helps people who are mentally restless to stay engaged without needing the radio or television as a bothersome third party. Any verbal repetition that occurs mentally or even verbally can help to focus thinking patterns into a place for sleep while setting aside thoughts of unhappiness or agitation to be dealt with in the morning.\n\nInsomnia can be an ongoing problem, but it doesn\u2019t have to control your life. By discovering what the root cause of your sleeplessness happens to be, you can begin taking back control of your nightly routine to get the true rest that you need. Treat that root cause with one of these effective, natural remedies for insomnia and you can start feeling better as soon as tomorrow morning.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "9 Natural Alternatives to Caffeine and Ephedrine | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/natural-alternatives-to-caffeine-and-ephedrine/",
    "content": "Fatigue happens to everyone at some point in the day. Even with a good night\u2019s sleep, the afternoon often brings a wall that people smack into with consistency. Rather than making another cup of coffee or taking a stimulant like ephedrine to get through the rest of the day, could there be some natural alternatives that can provide the same effect?\n\nThe issue with stimulants like caffeine and ephedrine is that they act as a diuretic on the body and also drain your adrenal glands. That means you\u2019ll feel more awake and you\u2019ll climb over that wall, but you\u2019ll dehydrate yourself during the process. Once the effects of the caffeine or ephedrine wear off, you\u2019ll actually feel even more fatigued because your body is craving fluids!\n\nThe Effects of Caffeine\n\nMany people are challenged by reaching a balance between consuming too many stimulants and an inability to perform. If you consume too much, you increase your blood pressure, create conditions for insomnia, and can become incredibly irritable. This also happens when you end up relying on these stimulants to get going every day.\n\nThankfully, there are some very effective natural alternatives to caffeine and ephedrine that will help you get going without the potential risk you assume by taking the stimulants.\n\n9 Alternatives to Caffeine\n\n1. Apples. One of the best fruits available for a good morning pick-me-up is the apple. It has high levels of fructose that will give your body a natural energy boost through the transference of fuel into your cells. It isn\u2019t going to provide the exact same results that caffeine or ephedrine can provide, but you also won\u2019t be putting drugs into your system or be draining your endocrine system to get a good level of alertness to start your day.\n\n2. Cafix. Made from a variety of different herbs, what Cafix does is mimic the taste and psychological effect of coffee so that it seems like you\u2019re getting the caffeine you want when you really aren\u2019t getting any at all. Most people don\u2019t realize that decaffinated coffee still actually contains a small amount of naturally occurring caffeine. Cafix is a better all-natural alternative that won\u2019t help you with any withdrawal symptoms you might face, but can help you get off of the stimulants once and for all.\n\n3. Eucalyptus. One of the unique features of the eucalyptus is that it can immediately open up an inflamed or stuffed up airway. It\u2019s one of the key ingredients in many rubs and creates an instant alertness that can be felt from the very first inhalation. That\u2019s right; you don\u2019t have to consume anything to feel more energetic with this natural caffeine alternative.\n\n4. Gingko Biloba. This nut is used as an herbal extract in a wide variety of ways. It helps people feel more alert because it increases the circulation of blood throughout the body, making the blood vessels literally feel like you\u2019ve been exercising for 30 minutes. This constriction helps to wake your body up naturally because it needs to work harder to perform basic functions. The initial effects of the natural caffeine alternative are temporary, but the results of feeling more alert and awake can often last throughout the day.\n\n5. Ginseng. It\u2019s used for virtually everything else, so why not use Ginseng as a way to wake up? It makes many people feel more awake and alert, which means it, is included in many of today\u2019s energy drinks for an added boost. You can also find this root in powdered form to include in your other drinks or food if you want, but it can cause some side effects that are just as difficult as what caffeine and ephedrine can cause.\n\n6. Guayusa. This supplement is made from the leaves of a holly tree that is found only in the Amazon rainforest. The first step in the process of creating Guayusa is that the leaves must be fully dried so that they can develop into a good flavor. It simulates the act of a stimulant on the body when taken, but without the sometimes harsh side effects that ephedrine or caffeine can bring. Its most commonly brewed as a tea, but once the leaves are dried, they can also be crushed up and put into capsules, put in with food, or used in a variety of other ways.\n\n7. Tea. An entire book could be written about the various proven and purported effects that tea has on the human body. Some forms of tea to have high levels of caffeine, so be aware of what kind of tea you select. It helps to energize the body for a variety of reasons, many dependent on the type and composition of the tea you happen to be consuming. Almost all of them, however, have one thing in common: the water used to brew them helps your body feel more awake.\n\n8. Vitamin B12. More people are deficient in this critical vitamin than you\u2019d think. When you don\u2019t have enough B12, you can begin experiencing physical symptoms that mimic Multiple Sclerosis or even ALS. It\u2019s so common to not have enough of this vitamin that testing for it is one of the first steps in the diagnosis process. It helps to enhance mental clarity, but it also helps to produce melatonin too. That means when you get enough of this vitamin, you\u2019ll end up feeling more awake and still be able to fall asleep quickly at night.\n\n9. Yerba Mate. To be fair, Yerba mate contains some caffeine, so it\u2019s not a true natural alternative. What sets it apart, however, is the fact that is also contains two other xanthines that help to provide a higher level of alertness without the severe dehydration effects that ephedrine or caffeine can have on their own. It\u2019s made by steeping the leaves of the holly plant into hot water and then letting them soak, much like a tea. It only grows in South America, but you can find this drink pretty much anywhere today in places that specialize in imported products.\n\nThese alternatives to caffeine and ephedrine can help you be able to be alert and focused without paying a dehydration penalty or draining your adrenals.\n\nWhether you\u2019re just trying to cut back on the amount of caffeine that you drink or you want to seek out healthier, natural alternatives, these supplements and foods will help you achieve your goals quickly and efficiently.",

    "content": "Proper sleep is very important, I think even more so than diet and exercise. A few nights of poor sleep WILL cause a lot of negative effects on the body\u2026 let alone months of it.\n\nMost of us are not getting deep, quality sleep and this is especially true for night shift workers.\n\nNight Shift Work Health Problems\n\nAnd the biggest problem of all, which is sleep problems \u2013 such as trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep\n\nThere is one underlying cause of all of these problems and I\u2019ll tell you about it in a minute.\n\nHowever, there is a secondary type of health problem and that is emotional \u2013 such as:\n\nIsolation & loneliness \u2013 since you\u2019re on a different type of schedule than your friends and family\n\nNow, what\u2019s linked to all of these problems is the disruption of the natural sleep/wake cycle\u2026 Which affects how the body functions and interferes with the natural release of hormones and chemicals in the body.\n\nAnd two powerful hormonal imbalances are:\n\nmelatonin \u2013 the sleep hormone\n\ncortisol \u2013 the stress hormone.\n\nYou see, the problem is that on a normal schedule and circadian rhythm, your stress hormone cortisol is high in the morning \u2013 to wake you up and energize you. This is especially important to get sunlight first thing in the morning.\n\nThen at night, cortisol drops, and melatonin increases to get you ready for sleep. Now we want nighttime, dim lights, and so forth.\n\nBut when you\u2019re on the night shift, especially the midnight \u2013 8 am, the opposite is happening.\n\nNight Shift Solutions\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about solutions\u2026 which by the way, can be used by anyone who wants better sleep.\n\nThe MOST important thing for shift workers is to keep the SAME schedule every day. Yes, that means the weekends too.\n\nBy doing this, you reset your circadian rhythm to a more customized version for YOU. Your body will adapt and now your cortisol and melatonin levels will be more consistent and better.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s still not going to be as good as a regular shift worker and this is where taking natural supplements to help optimize your cortisol and melatonin levels becomes very important.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s keep going with the solutions:\n\nWhen it\u2019s time for you to go to bed, you need to prepare your body for sleep. This means about an hour or two before going to bed, you need to:\n\nMake your home darker. This means black-out curtains, and dimming the lights in your home. You need to create a feeling as if it\u2019s nighttime.\n\nAbout an hour before bed, take a sleep-promoting supplement that contains melatonin, but also additional herbs to help your body and mind relax. I take Deep Sleep Formula.\n\nIf you feel stressed\u2026 physically or emotionally. Then chances are your cortisol and stress hormones are elevated. So, you need to lower cortisol levels. The two best ways are eating a higher carbohydrate meal about an hour or two before bed. And taking specific herbs and vitamins that are proven to lower cortisol and stress hormones. I take Stress & Cortisol Relief.\n\nNoise can also be a problem since the rest of the world is up, so I would suggest wearing earplugs or using a sound machine.\n\nSo, that\u2019s the sleep part. Ideally, you wake up without an alarm.\n\nWhen you do, if there\u2019s light out, go outside as soon as possible and get sunlight on your body and eyes. It\u2019ll reset your circadian rhythm in a positive way.\n\nTry to also exercise within a couple of hours of waking up to jump-start your body and hormones. It can be as little as a brisk 20-30 min walk.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t consume any caffeine products within 8 hours of bedtime. Ideally, the coffee for example will be consumed within a couple of hours after waking up \u2026 but not all day long because it\u2019ll negatively affect your sleep.\n\nSame with alcohol. It might make you sleepy and tired, but it causes poor REM sleep, and sleep quality drops dramatically.\n\nImportant \"Deep Quality Sleep\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for improving your sleep - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with sleep!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve \"deep quality sleep\" with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/sexual-health/3-worst-times-to-have-sex/",
    "content": "Today, we are discussing the worst times to have sex based on the impact on your sexual performance, which depends heavily on three critical factors: your hormones, blood flow, and mental state.\n\nDiscover why timing is crucial and what you can do to ensure better sexual health.\n\nLate at Night: Hormonal Downshift\n\nThe majority of people tend to have sex between 9:00 PM and 1:00 AM.\n\nIronically, this is one of the least ideal times.\n\nAt night, your body is in wind-down mode, preparing for sleep. This means melatonin levels rise while testosterone, crucial for sexual performance, hit its lowest daily levels.\n\nThe relaxed state might be good mentally, but physically, it\u2019s not the best for sexual activity.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just theory; it\u2019s backed by our understanding of circadian rhythms and hormone cycles.\n\nPost-Dinner: Digestive Distractions\n\nAnother suboptimal time is right after eating a big meal.\n\nIt might follow the traditional date night script, but physiologically, it\u2019s problematic.\n\nWhen you eat, blood flow is redirected to your digestive tract to help with digestion, leaving less available for other functions, including sexual activity.\n\nThis not only makes it harder to get and maintain an erection but also affects women similarly, reducing blood flow to the clitoris.\n\nPost-Exercise Sex: Physical Exhaustion\n\nLastly, right after intense workouts, particularly strenuous sessions like leg or back workouts, is not ideal.\n\nYour body\u2019s blood flow focuses on repairing stressed muscles, not supporting an erection or sexual arousal.\n\nAfter a tough workout, your body needs rest, not another form of physical exertion.\n\nPractical Solutions for Better Sex\n\nOptimal Timing for Sex: If your schedule allows, try engaging in sexual activity in the morning when testosterone levels are naturally higher. This aligns with your body\u2019s hormonal setup for optimal performance.\n\nMeal Planning for Better Sex: If evenings are the only option, ensure you have a lighter meal and allow a couple of hours for digestion before engaging in sexual activity. This spacing helps manage blood flow more effectively for both digestion and sexual function.\n\nAdjusting Workout Schedules: If you\u2019re planning a romantic evening, consider scheduling lighter workouts or ensuring there\u2019s adequate recovery time before sexual activity. Alternatively, engaging in sex before your workout can also be a good strategy, leveraging the higher energy and blood flow levels pre-exercise.\n\nEnhancing Performance with Supplements\n\nFor those looking to support their sexual health further, supplements like AlphaViril can help boost testosterone levels, and Blood Flow Optimizer enhances circulation, complementing your efforts to find the best time for sex.\n\nUnderstanding when not to have sex is as crucial as knowing the best times.\n\nBy considering your body\u2019s natural rhythms and physiological needs, you can significantly improve your sexual experiences.\n\ninclude ($_SERVER[\u2018DOCUMENT_ROOT\u2019] . \u2018/wp-content/includes/av/youtube-cta.php\u2019); [/insert_php",

    "content": "Melatonin, most commonly known as the \u201csleep hormone\u201d, gets secreted at night, to help you sleep.\n\nHowever, what most people don\u2019t realize is that melatonin has so many other powerful anti-aging benefits.\n\nSadly, melatonin gets secreted less and less as we get older.\n\nAnd these days, due to electronic devices, getting less sunlight, having more stress, and so forth, Melatonin gets secreted even less in most of us, including younger people.\n\nIs It Safe To Take Melatonin Every Night?\n\nFIRST, Melatonin is a hormone, so you have to be careful taking hormones because your body can adapt to them and they can have risks.\n\nSECOND, the dosages you can get in supplements are all over the place and can get confusing. As low as 500 mcg or half an mg, to as much as 10 mg pills or higher?!!\n\nTHIRD, there have been studies testing over 30+ different melatonin products and shockingly, about 75% of them did NOT contain the correct amount listed on the label. Some even had levels 10X higher.\n\nPuberty & Sexual Health\n\nAs far as risks, there have been studies showing that giving melatonin to children going through puberty, can negatively affect their sexual production. This is not set in stone, but I wouldn\u2019t risk it for my kids.\n\nBesides, children make plenty of melatonin and you should NOT be giving them this hormone, even if it\u2019s over the counter.\n\nThe higher the dose, the faster your body will adapt.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s best to take melatonin with other sleep ingredients such as those to stimulate GABA, Serotonin, and so forth.\n\nAlso the higher the melatonin dose, the groggier you\u2019ll feel in the morning.\n\nThus, less is more. Better to combine melatonin with other key, non-hormonal ingredients.\n\nAs far as the dose, I think up to 3 mg taken an hour before bed is the most one would need or should take.\n\nLastly, as stated earlier with the wrong dosages\u2026 You need to select a reputable brand that has their product 3rd party tested, USP verified, and has a certificate of analysis with every batch, to guarantee that the exact dose of melatonin on the label, is in the bottle.\n\nRemember, hormones are powerful and so is melatonin. Just because it\u2019s over the counter, doesn\u2019t mean any dose is safe.\n\nMelatonin can certainly help aid in your deep, quality sleep, especially when combined with other ingredients.\n\nYou can take it nightly, but I suggest taking off maybe 1 or 2 days a week.\n\nTake a look at other important links and videos for improving your sleep, including the best ingredients to use with Melatonin and the brand I personally take.\n\nImportant \"Deep Quality Sleep\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for improving your sleep - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort...

    "content": "I was asked recently if it\u2019s advisable to take an afternoon nap?\u2026 and will it help build more muscle and/or lose fat?\n\nThis is a great question because getting better, deeper sleep is easily one of the most important things you can do for your health, fitness, and longevity \u2014 physically, mentally, AND emotionally.\n\nUnfortunately, most of us do not get enough sleep and for sure, we don\u2019t get deep sleep.\n\nThis is due to poor lifestyle choices and sleep hygiene, such as:\n\nToo much light before sleep, especially from electronic devices.\n\nErratic sleeping patterns.\n\nWhat you eat or drink or don\u2019t eat/drink before bed.\n\nStress and having your mind racing and worrying about life.\n\nTaking substances that you think will help with sleep, but actually cause poorer sleep \u2013 such as sleeping pills, alcohol, marijuana, and similar drugs.\n\nAnd because of the poor sleep, you have hormonal imbalances. Less positive, youth hormones \u2013 such as testosterone, growth hormones, thyroid, melatonin, etc.. while you have more negative, aging hormones such as stress hormones like cortisol, adrenaline, and higher insulin levels.\n\nThe end result is hormonal imbalances and accelerated aging \u2013 resulting in less muscle, more belly fat, and poorer mental performance.\n\nSo yes, taking an afternoon nap, especially if you didn\u2019t get a good night\u2019s sleep, is a great idea\u2026 as long as it doesn\u2019t negatively affect your sleep in the evening.\n\nSome people, when they nap, go to bed later or they wake up more often in the middle of the night. The nap is now hurting your total sleep, not helping it.\n\nSo, in this situation, I suggest you don\u2019t nap. Instead, maybe just go for a relaxing walk to relax your body, or meditate.\n\nAlso, keep your naps short. For sure less than 60 minutes. I suggest between 15-30 min.\n\nThe truth is that because of your body\u2019s circadian rhythm, you\u2019ll naturally be more tired in the afternoon.

    "content": "Over the past few thousand years, there have been many different treatments used for the feelings of anxiety. One of the most interesting is magnolia bark which has gained favor in recent years as a natural product which can help people reduce their tension levels and actually promote good sleep as well.\n\nFor those who are wary of taking prescribed medicines, magnolia bark may be an answer that works specifically for their needs.\n\nWhat is Magnolia Bark?\n\nThe bark from the Magnolia oficinalis tree has been a part of traditional Chinese medicines for many centuries and was specifically used in the treatment of anxiety. This is probably because of a natural compound found in the bark of the tree known as \u201chonokiol\u201d which is the active ingredient that causes this calming effect.\n\nThe effects of consuming magnolia bark are also present in animals as well, which may be how the effects on anxiety were first discovered many centuries ago. Today, it is used for a wide variety of treatments outside anxiety which include digestive issues, inflammation, weight loss and even asthma. The bud of the magnolia is also used for a number of other treatments as well.\n\nHowever, in terms of Western medicine, magnolia bark is still relatively unknown as it only has been recently introduced to mainstream science in the past few decades. Initial studies have shown that magnolia bark does indeed possess the qualities which can improve sleep, ease the symptoms of depression and anxiety as well. When used in combination with magnesium, the magnolia bark was highly effective with menopausal women who also suffered from symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\nIs Magnolia Bark the Answer to Anxiety?\n\nThe short answer is no as it is only temporary and will need to be taken over a long period of time. Research has not yet discovered whether the body builds a tolerance to magnolia bark which would render it useless after a period of time.\n\nHowever, when combined with other treatment magnolia bark may be even more effective in reducing anxiety on a long-term basis such as Mediation, breathing exercises, removing caffeine from the diet, reducing the amount of \u201cnegative\u201d input from the day, such as bad or depressing news and other factors that can help improve the overall mood of the person.\n\nPlus, the side effects of magnolia bark are not well known nor how it intermixes with other drugs or medications. Even taking a natural product may have dire consequences when mixed with a prescription or over the counter drug. This means that extra care must be taken in order to not mix the magnolia bark with a product that might cause a serious reaction.\n\nIn addition, general exercise and eating better can help a person overcome mild symptoms of anxiety as well. For those who are suffering from anxiety and want a natural treatment, magnolia bark may be the answer. However, it is best to consult with your doctor first in order to fully diagnose the symptoms and recommended treatments that may or may not include magnolia bark.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

People who have taken this product report that they wake up feeling more refreshed and ready to go.\n\nVersatility: While most people may use this product to help them overcome insomnia, it is also very effective in relieving jet lag as well.\n\nAntioxidant: One of the many attributes of this product it that it is loaded with antioxidants which suppress the free radicals in the body. Free radicals cause premature damage to the hair, skin and nails which can be overcome by the intake of antioxidants. There has been research showing that antioxidants may be a factor in preventing the formation of certain types of cancer.\n\nLess Expensive: Perhaps one of the most popular reasons that melatonin is so popular is that it is very inexpensive to purchase. For many, this will fit within their budget and provide an effective night\u2019s sleep. Plus, melatonin is easy to find online and at local retail stores as well.\n\nWhat Are the Cons of Melatonin?\n\nDespite the number of advantages that melatonin offers, there are a number of disadvantages that melatonin brings as well. Before purchasing this product, it is important to take everything into consideration first.\n\nDrowsiness: Arguably the most obvious symptom of using melatonin is that it can cause drowsiness which may affect your ability to drive your vehicle or operate heavy machinery.\n\nAge Spots: One of the side effects of melatonin is the increase in the number of age spots that will appear on the skin. For young people, this may not be an issue. But for those who are fighting age spots, the addition of melatonin will make the condition worse.\n\nDecreased Sex Drive: Studies have shown that this product may have a negative effect on your sex drive and may even decrease fertility as well. Plus, severe headaches may result depending on the condition of the person taking the product.\n\nDepression: Melatonin may also have an adverse reaction for those who are currently suffering from depression. This means that before you take this product, consult with your physician.\n\nThere are also studies that show people who suffer from autoimmune disorders and schizophrenia may suffer from negative effects as well. If you are taking prescription or an over the counter medication, you will need to consult with your doctor first before taking melatonin. However, for the most part melatonin is a safe product and can be taken normally.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "When it comes to which drug is better, Klonopin or Ativan, there has been some healthy debate in the medical community. Both drugs are used to treat anxiety-related issues and have been used by many people in this regard either as temporary or more long-lasting treatment to overcome these particular problems.\n\nThere are a considerable number of differences between the drugs, although the one thing that they do have in common is that they both fall under the Bensodiazepine family. This means that both drugs have a roughly similar effect in that they induce sedation as well as being an anticonvulsant and have a muscle-relaxing effect as well.\n\nHowever, that is where the similarities for the most part end as each drug does have a different specific effect and they are even marketed in different ways as well. Klonopin, which is also known as Clonazepam, not only treats anxiety as well as panic disorders, but is also used to treat insomnia as well as epilepsy.\n\nAtivan, also known as Lorazepam, is effective at treating cases of chronic anxiety as well as insomnia. However, as compared to Klonopin, Ativan is considered by many in the medical field to be more addictive in nature which is why it is more controlled and only prescribed by physicians who can keep a close eye on their patients. While Ativan is highly effective at treating anxiety, it also has noted side effects which include the following;\n\nThis does make Ativan a drug that is more carefully administered to monitor if the side effects show up in those who take this particular drug.\n\nKlonopin is generally used for panic and seizure disorders while Ativan is more often used for anxiety disorders. In addition, Klonopin is generally prescribed with two to three doses per day while Ativan is generally given out in three to four doses per day. Overall, the effects may be similar in many instances, but Klonopin has fewer harmful side effects when taken in the prescribed amounts.\n\nKlonopin has an anti-depressant effect and is generally used for short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Ativan on the other hand has more of a medium-range effect and creates feelings of euphoria, unlike Klonopin. What both drugs do have in common is that the prescribed amount must not be exceeded during the day otherwise the risk of overdosing carries with it the possibilities of addiction up to death if not taken in the proper way.\n\nOverall, both drugs are similar in their chemical composition, but different in terms of their overall effects. For those who have the choice between either drug to treat their condition, it will depend in large part on the doctor making the prescription. For those who have concerns about the addictive qualities and side effects of Ativan, then Klonopin may be the better alternative. However, this will depend on the particular condition that is being treated and which drug may be more effective overall.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "When it comes to the differences between Provigil and Nuvigil, it is important first to understand what they are designed to do. In many ways, both drugs are similar in that they are created by Cephalon and have the same general effect. In fact, they are even similar in their chemical structure. However, there are differences which need to be explored before recommended one over the other.\n\nWhat is Provigil and Nuvigil?\n\nEach is a stimulant that is designed to treat excessive drowsiness. Unlike the temporary condition of being sleepy when you did not get a full night\u2019s rest, these are prescription drugs that help keep you alert if you feel drowsy despite being fully rested. Nuvigil is known is an enantiopure drug and chemically similar to Provigil with only a small difference.\n\nIt is important to fully understand all the similarities between the drugs as they are often prescribed in a similar fashion. Both drugs are analeptic compounds with affect the central nervous system. Both drugs are used to treat similar conditions including the following:\n\n1. Sleep Apnea 2. Narcolepsy 3. Shift Work Disorder\n\nOne difference between both of these drugs and traditional prescribed stimulants is that they do not carry the same side effects. Both Provigil and Nuvigil do not raise blood pressure or increase the heart rate. In addition, both drugs increase the level of dopamine that the body produces which helps increase the brain\u2019s ability to be awakened and alert. The overall effect is to help you stay alert during the day and then allow you to sleep peacefully at night.\n\nIn addition, both drugs have similar side effects that include headache, nausea, dizziness and trouble falling asleep. Provigil also may cause diarrhea, stuffy nose, and anxiety as well. However, the side effects have been noted in only about 5% of patients that have taken either drug. This means that both are very safe to take especially when compared to Ritalin or Adderall as these drugs may cause more serious side effects. What little information about the serious side effects from Provigil and Nuvigil cause are more along the lines of allergic reactions which are relatively rare.\n\nFinally, Nuvigil has been released more recently than Provigil and is more expensive. However, both drugs are very expensive if you do not have insurance. Nuvigil may cost upwards of $800 for a single month supply while Provigil may reach $600. However, there are generic forms of each drug that cost around $15 per dose which is somewhat less expensive.\n\nThe truth is that the differences between these drugs are minimal to say the least. While some patients prefer one to the other, there is really almost no difference between them other than the price and the fact that Provigil may have more minor side effects than Nuvigil if you are one of the 5% of those who take the product that suffer from those conditions. So, you should take your doctor\u2019s advice and select either pill that will work for your needs. However, if you suffer from the side effects of one, then it may happen with the other as well since they are so chemically similar in nature.",

    "content": "Both Ativan and Xanax are known as Benzodiazepines, a type of psychotropic drug that is used to treat anxiety. The purpose of each drug is for short-term relief from the effects of anxiety, although in many cases they are used in long term situations for which they are not designed.\n\nXanax is used to treat anxiety disorder and provide short term relief when it comes to panic disorder which may or may not include agoraphobia. In addition, it can be used to treat anxiety that is associated with depression. Ativan is used to provide short term relief for anxiety disorders mostly associated with symptoms of depression or anxiety associated insomnia.\n\nHowever, are there significant differences between both of these drugs?\n\nFirst, Xanax has been approved for use in treating panic disorders while Ativan has not. There have been many different trials and studies between these two drugs and interestingly enough each drug works well for panic disorder, although Ativan has yet to be officially approved. This is because there are indications that Ativan users are more vulnerable to becoming addicted to the drug as opposed to Xanax users when it comes to panic disorder. Ativan requires more doses during the day and it is believed that this type of dosage measure actually reinforces the potential for abuse.\n\nXanax comes in immediate and longer term relief dosages which provide it with a bit more flexibility in terms of its use. Xanax is generally taken twice a day to provide short term relief until the symptoms of anxiety are gone. Ativan usually requires more doses per day as directed.\n\nHowever, despite some of the differences, there are similarities in terms of the side effects that can be experienced.\n\n1. Nervous System Depression. 2. Cognitive Dysfunction and Memory Impairment. 3. Dizziness, Drowsiness and Fatigue. 4. Irritability and Sedation.\n\nIt is important to note you may also experience effects to your motor speech as well. There is no way to know about what side effects will occur until either drug is taken, but they are designed for short term use only of perhaps a week or two. It is important to note that for those who have been taking either drug for more than two weeks that stopping cold turkey may have bad side effects in and of itself. So, gradually reducing the medication amounts is recommended.\n\nXanax is relatively fast acting and will work for up to five hours in its standard form and up to 11 hours in its long term form. Ativan may last for up to 8 hours depending on the dosage and use. In addition, both drugs are relatively inexpensive and similar in price whether using the short term or extended release tablets.\n\nBoth drugs have the downside which is their risk of becoming dependent on the drugs. Studies have shown that both drugs have a nearly 50% addiction rate when used for the long term. However, that rate is based on something that is not what either drug is designed to do. Each drug is designed only for short term use where the addiction rate is much lower.",

Each is a nonbensodiazepine hypnotic drug that has a similar effect on the body, but they also carry with them the risk of addiction as well. While each drug is similar in makeup, there are differences in how they are prescribed.\n\nAmbien is what is known as a sedative-hypnotic drug that is designed to help people fall asleep faster. The product is available in tablets of varying dosages with an extended release version that helps people stay asleep longer. Lunesta is also a sedative-hypnotic drug that is used to treat insomnia by helping people fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Lunesta also comes in tablet form with varying dosages depending on the prescription.\n\nAmbien is taken orally on an empty stomach and is designed for short term usage that lasts no longer than two weeks in total. The effect of the drug on an empty stomach is very quick, so people are advised to take Ambien when they have gone to bed. Plus, they will need to allow for a full seven to eight hours of sleep in order to provide the body with what it needs for the night.\n\nLunesta has the same effects as Ambien and is taken in the same manner as well. Taking either drug on a full stomach will lessen its effects as it will take longer to get into the blood stream. Both drugs are also stored in the same manner out of the sunlight and they can last up to three years on the shelf.\n\nThe Differences Between Ambien and Lunesta\n\nThere are the typical differences that lie between the dosage amounts and how they are administered, but the most notable difference is that Lunesta is not limited to short term use like Ambien. Ambien is designed to overcome insomnia is a short period of time so that the body can properly rest. Lunesta however is available for longer-term usage which does raise questions about its addiction levels.\n\nHowever, the differences themselves are fairly minor overall when it comes to their effect, including side effects which are generally considered annoying, but not serious. While both products may produce an allergic reaction in certain patients that will require immediate medical attention, the general side effects of headache, dizziness and the like are remarkably similar.\n\nOverall, it can be stated that both drugs are very similar to the point where the only real difference is how long you can take Lunesta as compared to Ambien. In essence, those who feel that their insomnia issues may last for longer than two weeks may be more interested in taking Lunesta. However, the risk of becoming addicted to both brands of sleeping pills is strong enough to warrant caution and talking to your doctor to ensure that your body does not become addicted to either one.\n\nIn the end, the differences are fairly minor, so you may actually have some selection when it comes to which one works best for you.",

(Then again, so do a lot of other tactics, like sitting out in the sun.) However you choose to look at it, though, antidepressants are far from a safe remedy and it certainly does not address the underlying problem or provide a lasting solution.\n\nIn fact, antidepressants have serious side effects and may very well put your health \u2014 and, in MANY cases, your life \u2014 at risk.\n\nThe side-effects of antidepressants are well known; they include:\n\nInsomnia and sleep disturbances\n\nIncreased risk for blood pressure problems\n\nAdded risk for blood sugar problems\n\nImpaired immune system\n\nMuscle and joint pain\n\nUterine and stomach bleeding\n\nLoss of sexual interest\n\nIncreased risk of suicide\n\nAnd that are just a few \u201cconcerns.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you, but I wouldn\u2019t want to take something that has been shown to INCREASE the risk of suicide. After all, the reason you\u2019re taking the medication in the first place is to feel better and more optimistic!\n\nRecent studies have also shown that antidepressants are linked with an increased risk of heart problems in men, as it can thicken artery walls.\n\nAntidepressive Drugs: Effective?\n\nSeveral studies have arrived at the conclusion that MOST of the responses to antidepressants could also be achieved with a placebo. And only a few of the most severely depressed showed ANY kind of response to antidepressants.\n\nIt is also a well-documented fact that antidepressants are COMMONLY misprescribed. For those who fall into the group of people who have been misprescribed psychiatric drugs, please be aware that being made to try different options is a surefire gamble with your health.\n\nWhy Not Try Something Safe & Natural, First?\u2026\n\nEven if you feel you absolutely need drugs, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to try different, safer options that do not threaten your health? Why not try NATURAL remedies?\n\nHerbs like St. John\u2019s Wort, Phenibut, and Valerian Root have been proven to be highly effective. Following this logic, we combine the best and most effective ingredients in precise dosages into one clinically-proven product called ProVanax\u00ae.\n\nThis product has been around for years, proven to work for hundreds of thousands of people, and has received excellent reviews.

But if you\u2019re getting up a few times to pee and more importantly, it\u2019s negatively affecting your sleep and the person next to you in bed \u2013 well, then it\u2019s something we need to help improve or fix.\n\nBecause as you know, proper sleep is vital for health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nFrequent nighttime urination is called Nocturia.\n\nNocturia tends to happen for one of three possible reasons:\n\nyour bladder is having a hard time holding urine\n\nyou\u2019re producing more urine than usual during the day and then it needs to be released at night\n\nyou\u2019re producing more urine during the night while sleeping\n\nNocturia is caused by 3 major causes and an extra big problem for men:\n\nPeople who woke up at least once per night to use the bathroom were 40% more likely to have high blood pressure.\n\nAnd those who woke up multiple times each night had an even greater likelihood of it, well over 55%.\n\nLuckily there is a way to having healthy blood pressure, naturally\u2026by utilizing natural herbs and vitamins to help to optimize your blood pressure numbers.\n\nOne of the symptoms or warning signs that you might be diabetic is being overly thirsty and constant urination.\n\nWhen you are not metabolizing sugars or glucose properly, there\u2019s more pressure or work done by your kidneys and this causes more frequent urination.\n\nIf you do have blood sugar issues, which most people do as we get older, LOSE the extra body fat.\n\nEating a healthier diet and exercising is very important.\n\nThe good news is that there are specific vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids that help support healthy blood sugar, carbohydrate metabolism, and insulin sensitivity.\n\nThese days, most people are poor sleepers \u2013 we either have a hard time falling asleep or staying asleep or usually BOTH.\n\nUsually, it\u2019s not the need to urinate that wakes you up. It\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re awake and then you decide to go pee.\n\nIn deep sleep, most people typically don\u2019t pee. Your body shuts off. Just like when you\u2019re exercising.\n\nSo, make sure you practice good sleep hygiene.\n\nMake sure you take some specific vitamins, herbs, and amino acids that help you stay asleep naturally, like when you were younger.\n\nHaving prostate problems is another issue of frequent urination.\n\nAs we get older, due to negative hormonal changes, our prostate will grow. It\u2019s called BPH or benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\nThis extra growth causes your urinary stream to be weaker and/or you just don\u2019t empty all of the urine in the bladder.\n\nSo, you keep waking back up to finish the job.\n\nAgain, this is mainly caused by hormonal imbalances\u2026 typically, a decrease in testosterone, but an increase in DHT, female, and stress hormones.\n\nThe good news is that you do NOT need to take drugs that will end up causing impotence.\n\nThere are herbs and vitamins that really do help support healthy prostate function. You\u2019ll also have better, bigger, and fuller erections and libido.",

    "content": "Today I want to talk about something that\u2019s NEGATIVELY affecting almost ALL of us, including children, and that\u2019s the light from screens \u2014 which includes your smartphones, laptops, pads, other handheld devices, and even smart TVs.\n\nNot only is the strong, bright light from such devices bad for your health, brain waves, hormones, and sleep\u2026 the blue light, in particular, can be very damaging and toxic to your eyes.\n\nScientist have discovered that the blue light emitted from such screens can lead to macular degeneration \u2013 which is one of the leading causes of vision loss.1\n\nBlue light appears to damage retinal cells.\n\nIn fact, the retinal-generated toxicity by blue light is universal. It can kill any cell type!\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how much blue light is needed and for how long it\u2019s necessary to damage these sight-seeing cells.\n\nUnfortunately, we do know that the damage is irreversible!\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re going to go blind anytime soon. However, aging alone causes a decrease in eyesight, so why accelerate the process with blue light?!!?!\u2026\n\nAnd remember, blue light is ALSO emitted by the sun \u2013 in addition to all of these devices.\n\nThus, there\u2019s an accumulated effect, which is why more and more people have vision problems these days, at a younger age.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Solution\n\nNow, I\u2019m not going to tell you to stop using your computer, cell phone, or stop watching TV. It\u2019s just not practical, possible, or probable.\n\nSo, here are some steps in reducing the damage from such devices and the blue light.\n\nWatching such devices in the dark and at night, can intensify the blue light. So, stop using your phone in bed or in the dark.\n\nThe newest phones have \u201cblue light filters\u201d that you can turn on \u2013 iPhones, Androids, etc. all have such a feature. Make sure you turn it on, especially at night when the sun comes down.\n\nOn your desktop and computers, such blue-light filters, also exist in the newest computers. Just activate it.\n\nYou should also install blue-light filter software and apps, such as f.lux.2 This is what I\u2019ve used on my computers for a few years now. When the sun goes down, it automatically gets activated and turns OFF the blue-light from your screen. It\u2019s a free program.\n\nI also suggest wearing blue-blocker glasses at night. Good for your eyes AND sleep. This way you can also watch TV and not get hit by the blue-light. You can get these blue-blocking glasses at amazon.com.3 It\u2019s super inexpensive.\n\nUltimately, you want to reduce some of the screen time. This is especially important for children who seem to be glued to their ipads. Even if it\u2019s educational material and videos, it\u2019s still unhealthy for their eyes, brain waves, and hormones.\n\nAnd I know this seems like a big inconvenience, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. All of these devices have such blue-blocking features these days and simply wearing the blue-blocking glasses in the evening will reduce the eye-damaging effects tremendously!\n\nhttp://utnews.utoledo.edu/index.php/08_08_2018/ut-chemists-discover-how-blue-light-speeds-blindness\n\nhttps://justgetflux.com/ \u2013 Blue light blocking software\n\nhttps://amzn.to/2GS1Pho \u2013 Blue light blocking glasses",

    "content": "Have you noticed how a sunny day, or the first morning light striking your window leaves you feeling hopeful? And when you look out the window and take it in, do you feel suddenly energized, like the sun\u2019s rays has struck a bolt of unexpected optimism right through you? And when the weather changes, darkening, all that optimism goes right out the window from where it came.\n\nWell, you\u2019re not alone. There\u2019s an established link between feeling low and overcast weather. A lack of light has a direct effect on your mood. According to various findings, sunlight acts as a natural mood enhancer, which serves to boost productivity \u2013 and some say, creativity. That\u2019s because when light is detected, you don\u2019t produce as much melatonin; instead, serotonin (its jollier hormone) steps in to elevate your mood.\n\nFor many years, researchers have examined the relationship between weather and temperament, noting that some people are more susceptible to weather changes than others. Those who are more vulnerable to experiencing a low mood during the cold, dark winter are said to have Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).\n\nTo get around this, experts recommend taking steps to strengthen the brain\u2019s resistance against mood changes in the winter, such as making sure to listen to \u201cfeel-good\u201d music, exercising, meditating, or revisiting vacation photos \u2013 whatever lifts your mood. This helps you build resiliency to emotional clouds brought on by bad-tempered weather.\n\nWhen the sun is out, however, you should take the opportunity to recharge your batteries. That is, shut down your computer and go out in the sun. (Wearing sunscreen, of course, and not baking into a crisp.) Getting a little sunlight is a natural way to store up on your serotonin, and instantly feel better. When summer is here, you have no excuse but to take advantage of it.\n\nOh, and speaking of natural ways to feel good, have you taken your ProVanax today? If you haven\u2019t, hop to it.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll see you next time.",
