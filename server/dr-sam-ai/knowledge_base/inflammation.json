    "content": "Apparently, in 2025, most people are consuming about one credit card\u2019s worth of plastic every week due to microplastics.\n\nThese particles are now found in the lungs, brain, blood, and even in men\u2019s semen.\n\nSo, today\u2019s topic is about how you can identify if you might have microplastics in your system \u2014 and more importantly, what you can do to get rid of them and prevent further accumulation.\n\nWe produce over 430 million tons of plastic every year. Microplastics are detected in rainwater, food, toothpaste, cosmetics, and even bottled water.\n\nSerious Consequences of Microplastics In Your Body\n\n1. Unexplained Inflammation\n\nMicroplastics trigger an immune response by releasing inflammatory cytokines.\n\nJoint and muscle pain\n\n2. Brain Fog and Poor Memory\n\nMicroplastics cross the blood-brain barrier, disrupting neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin.\n\nPoor memory and focus\n\nLow mood, energy, and libido\n\n3. Hormonal Imbalance\n\nMicroplastics act as endocrine disruptors (e.g., BPA, phthalates), which can:\n\nDisrupt thyroid and adrenal hormones\n\nIncrease cortisol (stress hormone)\n\nMicroplastics damage the gut lining and microbiome, contributing to:\n\nGas and abdominal discomfort\n\nRemember, a dysfunctional gut impacts your entire health system.\n\n5. Weak Immune System\n\nConstant exposure to microplastics weakens your immune defenses, leading to:\n\nFrequent colds and infections\n\nIncreased long-term disease risk, including cancer\n\nWhat Causes Microplastics to Build Up?\n\nIt\u2019s not just food or bottled water. Microplastics are everywhere \u2014 in the air, household items, and even clothing. Examples include:\n\nChewing gum and plastic-coated tea bags\n\nSynthetic fabrics and cosmetics\n\nHow to Prevent and Eliminate Microplastics\n\nUse glass or stainless steel containers and bottles\n\nNever microwave food in plastic\n\nChoose natural fibers like cotton and wool\n\nFilter your water using reverse osmosis systems\n\nVacuum and dust regularly to reduce airborne particles\n\nUse HEPA filters in high-use rooms like bedrooms and offices\n\nEat more fiber-rich foods (fruits, veggies, or fiber supplements like Metamucil)\n\nExercise regularly to sweat out toxins\n\nTake activated charcoal to bind plastic particles\n\nSupport detox with NAC and ALA for liver and kidney health\n\nPractice intermittent fasting or consistent physical activity to boost autophagy\n\nSadly, we can\u2019t control everything in our environment, but we can take daily steps to limit microplastic exposure and support the body\u2019s detoxification process.\n\nReducing inflammation is key to better health, energy, and hormonal balance.\n\nBonus: I\u2019ve created a free guide \u2013 the \u201cMicroplastics Detox Blueprint.\u201d It includes more strategies, food swaps, and supplement tips.",

    "title": "Avoid Top 3 Causes Of Inflammation In 2025 Clinically Proven",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/avoid-the-top-3-causes-of-inflammation-clinically-proven/",
    "content": "As stated in part 1, the #1 cause of aging, pain, and health problems are all linked to inflammation.\n\nIn today\u2019s part 2, I\u2019ll reveal the top 3 causes of inflammation. Thus, things you need to reduce or avoid in your life.\n\nFinally, in part 3, you\u2019ll discover simple solutions for supporting a healthy inflammatory response. Thus, things you can add to your life.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s just as important to remove BAD things in your life, as it is to add in GOOD things.\n\nYou\u2019ll get double the positive results, with far less effort.\n\nInflammatory Foods (Reduce/Avoid)\n\nYour diet and the foods you eat is one of the biggest causes of chronic inflammation. The 5 worst foods are:\n\nSugars \u2013 This includes table sugar, syrups, juices, and alcohol. This doesn\u2019t include whole fruits.\n\nAlcohol \u2013 I consider alcohol sugar. Wine is grape juice. Alcohol itself causes inflammation throughout the body, starting in the liver and your brain. Sure, a little may reduce it in some studies, but in the long term, it causes many other negatives.\n\nBad Fats \u2013 these are fake, artificial hydrogenated trans fats. Vegetable and seed oils are high in omega-6 fats. Foods that typically contain these fats are french fries and fried fast foods, many packaged foods, and pastries.\n\nRefined carbohydrates \u2013 not all carbs are bad. Unfortunately, many of the good-tasting ones are, such as candy, snack foods, bread, pasta, pastries, most cereals, and many packaged foods.\n\nProcessed Proteins \u2013 This is one of the worst that most people never think about. Again, all the good-tasting stuff like sausage, hot dogs, bacon, ham, smoked meats, jerky, and so forth. Basically, \u201cfake\u201d protein. Oh, I almost forgot one of the worst proteins of all \u2013 DAIRY!\n\nAnd how you cook your food matters too. For example, don\u2019t fry your food.\n\nIn future articles, I\u2019ll go deeper into these and other inflammatory foods, more examples, how to quickly spot problem ingredients, and why and how these foods are bad for you.\n\nInflammatory Exercises (Reduce/Avoid)\n\nExercise is amazing. Unfortunately, most people don\u2019t exercise daily, and worst of all, they don\u2019t MOVE much at all.\n\nAnd the good news is that the right type of exercise actually helps support a healthy inflammatory response and I\u2019ll get into that a bit later.\n\nHowever, the WRONG type of exercise actually causes chronic inflammation.\n\nAnd there are two forms of exercise:\n\nAerobic \u2013 this is basically cardiovascular. Things like long-distance running and cycling and High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), induce high levels of chronic inflammation. This is why you hear runners dying of heart problems \u2013 it\u2019s because of inflammation in the heart, arteries, and so forth.\n\nAnaerobic \u2013 this is muscle building, resistance exercise. The worst is CrossFit and weight lifting where you\u2019re constantly going to failure and beyond, with heavyweights. Too much volume and intensity cause chronic inflammation.\n\nBoth of these scenarios also cause chronically elevated stress hormones like cortisol, because your body is trying its best to reduce chronic inflammation.\n\nIn fact, the heavy lifting and high-intensity workouts are what caused my own personal inflammation problems in my shoulders, knees, and back.\n\nIn future articles, I\u2019ll reveal the best exercises to reduce inflammation.\n\nHowever, if you still want to do these inflammatory exercises, there are ways around it and I\u2019ll tell you how in a minute.\n\nStress = Inflammation\n\nAnd of course, we can\u2019t forget about stress \u2013 physical and emotional stress.\n\nBy the way, the high-intensity workouts I just mentioned, that stress the body.\n\nAnd stress is good, it makes the body stronger. But too much, ongoing, high stress without proper recovery is the problem.\n\nAnd this is also true with stress to your brain and emotional stress.\n\nBasically, stress causes negative changes in your hormones, which then causes whole-body inflammation.\n\nIn fact, here\u2019s a true story\u2026\n\nRecently someone very, very close to me \u2013 his wife got cancer. Guess what happened to my friend?\u2026\n\nWithin days of hearing the news that his wife had cancer, he started to have back pain. He couldn\u2019t even stand up straight, it was too painful.\n\nThis went on for months until his wife\u2019s cancer went into remission and she was healthy again.\n\nThen, within a few weeks, all of a sudden, his back pain disappeared.\n\nYes, stress (emotional and physical) causes inflammation, which causes pain and diseases.\n\nIn fact, everything that I\u2019ve mentioned today \u2013 diet and exercise, are all stress-related.\n\nOf course, you can reduce some of your stress, which I\u2019ll tell you how. But then there are stresses that you can\u2019t control, but you can manage them.\n\nThus, never feel like a victim or helpless or hopeless.\n\nYOU are always in control.\n\nPoor Sleep = Inflammation\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one thing that happens to all of us every day that controls stress and inflammation and that\u2019s, SLEEP!\n\nYup, poor sleep causes inflammation\u2026 Both to your body and your brain.\n\nThat\u2019s right, poor sleep increases inflammation leading to and accelerating brain problems such as memory issues etc\n\nInflammation also causes stress to your gut, which causes a million other problems \u2013 including emotional.\n\nThus, leading to feelings of sadness, worry, and so forth.\n\nBasically, one of the best ways to let your body manage stress, lower negative hormones, and decrease inflammation is to have deeper and better sleep.\n\nMind you, I didn\u2019t say LONGER sleep \u2013 I said better and deeper sleep when all the repairing and growth is happening.\n\nBefore I give you a quick summary of what I\u2019ve covered today, I\u2019ve put a special link below, on my favorite ways to support healthy inflammatory responses.\n\nIt works quickly, it\u2019s easy, scientifically researched and proven, and best of all \u2013 requires no change in your lifestyle \u2014 diet, exercise, or sleep.\n\nSo, it\u2019s perfect for those of us who are super busy or just aren\u2019t as committed to making big changes in life, yet still, want all the benefits of lowered inflammation.\n\nHowever, you still want to\n\nAvoid inflammatory foods. I\u2019ve listed the bad ones, start slowly and remove more from your diet over the next few weeks and months.\n\nIf you are doing a lot of intense exercises, make sure you also increase your recovery. Cycle your workouts. And take natural anti-inflammatories.\n\nFinally, all of us need to improve our sleep. Be mindful and try to go to sleep 30-60 minutes earlier tonight. I promise you that you\u2019ll get better sleep with just this one method.\n\nAnd make sure you also utilize the same formula my family and I use daily, to help support healthy inflammatory response.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy inflammation & pain relief\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and inflammation is one of the biggest health problems that many of us are dealing with, especially as we get past the age of 35.\n\nIt causes numerous health problems, a major cause of aging, and also linked to joint pain issues.\n\nAnd the older we get, the more inflamed we become.\n\nWhat we drink, similar to what we eat, surely affects inflammatory factors in the body and thus can accelerate aging and cause more pain in the body.\n\nThere are polyphenols in certain tea and coffee\u2026 Enzymes found in pineapple juice\u2026 Resveratrol is found in wine\u2026 all of which claim to help reduce inflammation.\n\nBut, the truth is, each of these beverages will also cause inflammation in other ways, in addition to other health problems such as elevated blood sugar and stress hormones.\n\nONE Drink GUARANTEED To Lower Inflammation\n\nIt\u2019s a simple answer \u2013 it\u2019s water.\n\nI know it\u2019s not a \u201csexy\u201d answer, but remember \u2013 your body is made up of mostly water \u2013 salt water to be specific.\n\nUnfortunately, most people are dehydrated.\n\nWater benefits your entire body\n\nWater is good for your skin, muscles, and joints.\n\nWater keeps your organs cleaner and stronger.\n\nWater gets rid of toxins, which cause inflammation.\n\nSo, again \u2013 drink more clean water every day.\n\nI add a little bit of salt into the water, which helps it get better absorbed and also lowers anxiety.\n\nOne reason people pee a lot more when they start drinking more water is a lack of sodium to help absorb it.\n\nAgain, your body is made up mostly of SALT WATER.\n\nI also add a little bit of lemon juice as well into my water for taste and to help alkalize it.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ll add in stevia to sweeten it.\n\nIt ends up tasting like lemonade. But, with no calories, improves my mood and also helps reduce my appetite.\n\nI personally try to drink about a gallon a day.\n\nTry to aim for half your body weight in ounces. So, if you weigh 200 lbs, drink at least 100 oz of water. More if you exercise.\n\nI also take 2 other potent supplements \u2013 3-6 grams of fish oil a day and an herbal supplement called, Inflame & Pain Relief.\n\nThe end result is you\u2019ll look better, feel more energetic and live a better life!\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today I\u2019m going to talk about gut health and how vitally important it is to have lots of healthy bacteria in your body and gut \u2013 the truth about probiotics.\n\nThis topic is important for anyone who is interested in:\n\nPimples and zits, hair loss, wrinkles, and having great skin\n\nGaining muscle and losing fat\n\nImproving your mood and being happier\n\nBoosting your immune system\n\nHaving better hormones\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with pain and inflammation\n\nHealthier colon and regularity\n\nYup, your gut bacteria affects all of these factors. It\u2019s like an organ.\n\nUnfortunately, any time you take antibiotics, you basically kill off almost all of the friendly, healthy bacteria for months.\n\nThis is why today\u2019s topic is so important.\n\nI\u2019ll cover probiotics today. What they are. Best foods and supplements.\n\nIn my next article, I\u2019ll discuss prebiotics.\n\nFinally, in my 3rd article, I\u2019ll discuss the differences between the two and why you need to take both.\n\nI\u2019ll keep it all very simple and easy.\n\nMy Personal Experience With Probiotics\n\nI first started taking probiotics when I was 19, over 30 years ago.\n\nI had white spots on my skin, called tinea versicolor.\n\nIt\u2019s basically fungus. Many people have it, but my body is extra sensitive.\n\nEvery doctor just put me on antibiotics. It helped for a few months, but the problem kept coming back.\n\nSo my chiropractor told me to remove all yeast from my diet \u2013 which means no bread, beer, aged cheeses, and so forth.\n\nAnd then to take probiotics.\n\nA few months later, I was permanently cured and the problem has never come back.\n\nAgain, the power of diet and the correct supplements.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you, things have really changed, grown, and improved in the past few decades with gut health and probiotics.\n\nProbiotics are friendly bacteria, which can come from food or supplements. They help colonize your gut with health-boosting microorganisms.\n\nSimply stated, healthier gut bacteria equals a healthier YOU, from head to toe. Inside and out. Physically, mentally and emotionally. With both SHORT and LONG term benefits.\n\nI can go on and on about all the amazing benefits, but I hope you get the point.\n\nUnfortunately, the wrong foods, stress, artificial sweeteners, and of course, antibiotics all cause negative effects.\n\nSo, let\u2019s try to improve your friendly bacteria by eating some fermented foods that have lots of healthy probiotics.\n\nThese are the most popular foods you\u2019ve probably heard of.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read my previous articles, I do NOT think adults should be having dairy. I think milk is for babies and cow milk is for baby cows.\n\nSo, I suggest you limit yogurt and kefir.\n\nIf I do have yogurt, I have goat\u2019s milk. It\u2019s got a different form of casein milk which doesn\u2019t cause problems for most people.\n\nHowever, the best food in my opinion is Sauerkraut \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most powerful and has the most probiotics.\n\nIt\u2019s just cabbage. Make sure you also drink the juice, that\u2019s where the majority of the good bacteria is.\n\nJust don\u2019t do too much at once, or you\u2019ll be running to the bathroom.\n\nBest Probiotic Supplements\n\nNow, most of you won\u2019t eat these fermented foods daily. You\u2019d rather have a pill.\n\nAnd the good news is that there are dozens and hundreds of different probiotic pills you can take.\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s impossible to know which is the best, which your body needs, and how much.\n\nRemember, your body has hundreds of billions of bacteria, with over 500 different species.\n\nThere\u2019s no way ONE pill has all the correct ones and optimal dose.\n\nI really would have loved to come up with an all-in-one product for myself and YOU\u2026 But I would be lying if I said I could create one.\n\nThe Problem With Supplements\n\nProbiotics are typically measured in colony-forming units (CFU). Generally, higher doses have been found to produce the best results in most studies.\n\nHowever, some probiotics may be effective at dosages of 1\u20132 billion CFU per day, while others may require at least 20 billion CFU to achieve the desired effects.\n\nThen there are specific probiotics for specific health issues.\n\nSome are good for colon health, IBS and constipation.\n\nSome for weight loss.\n\nSome for brain health.\n\nSome for heart health.\n\nSome for mood and happiness. For example, in ProVanax I\u2019ve added over 100 billion probiotics, in 3 specific strains, which are clinically proven to improve your mood and reduce anxiety.\n\nAnd in the future, I\u2019ll be creating specialized ones for various health concerns.\n\nBut, what does that mean for you and me, today?\n\nWhat do I suggest for GENERAL health? What do I personally take?\n\nHonestly, I rotate between 3 to 4 different companies and probiotics because like I said, each has different CFUs, amounts, strains, and benefits.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll take one brand for 2 weeks, then another for 2 weeks, and another for 2 weeks, and another for 2 weeks and then go back and start all over again.\n\nI take Align Probiotic.\n\nIt was more expensive than the others. I just take 1 at night for 2 weeks. Here\u2019s a link to it on Amazon. I also pick it up at Costco if they have a sale.\n\nI also take Digestive Advantage by Schiff.\n\nIt costs less than Align.\n\nIt has 50 billion CFU, but more importantly, they claim it gets through the stomach acid, making it more effective.\n\nI\u2019ll then switch to this for the next two weeks, one pill at night.\n\nThese two products I take all the time, consistently.\n\nThe 3rd or 4th brand, it\u2019s up to you.\n\nAgain, pay attention to how many billions of CFU and the different strains. You want to keep mixing things up.\n\nJarrow has a lot of good probiotics and that\u2019s the company I first started using 30 years ago. So, you can give them a try as well.\n\nThe bottom line just keeps changing things up. Higher CFUs and lots of different strains.\n\nThere is no magic pill that does it all.\n\nBesides, your body will adapt and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep changing things up every couple of weeks.\n\nEat better, try to avoid antibiotics, eat sauerkraut, and make sure you also take PRE biotics, which is what the next article will discuss.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567038 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1500832/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9406136 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481240 http://iai.asm.org/content/76/8/3360.full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19007054\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567038\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1500832/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9406136\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481240\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org/content/76/8/3360.full\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19007054",

It\u2019s all about inflammation.\n\nIt\u2019s for anyone who is concerned about or cares about:\n\nHow You LOOK: Today\u2019s topic is linked to hair loss, acne, wrinkles, and belly fat. Stuff that most of us care about at any age, male or female.\n\nHow You FEEL: If you have joint pain, stiffness, and lack of mobility. For example, your back, shoulders, hands, knees and so forth. And if you have gut problems \u2013 such as indigestion, stomach pain, bloat, etc. And if you have allergies and asthma.\n\nHow You PERFORM: This includes anyone who exercises, especially those who put in extra effort running, lifting weights, and playing sports. Also, for the guys out there who are concerned about their performance in the bedroom, in regards to erections, impotence, & erectile problems.\n\nYour FUTURE: Finally, today\u2019s topic also is the primary cause of many health problems \u2014 brain & body.\n\nAt this point, you may be thinking, \u201cgeez\u2026 this is like every health problem\u201d. Yes, almost\u2026\n\nLike I said at the beginning, today\u2019s topic is major and life-changing.\n\nAnd you most definitely should listen if you take pain medications such as Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, etc..\n\nSo, what do all of these health problems have in common?\n\nYup, all of these health problems are unhealthy inflammatory responses.\n\nAnd today I\u2019m going to quickly talk about:\n\nand most importantly, easy, natural, and safe solutions.\n\n$30,000 In Stem Cells To Reduce Inflammation\n\nHowever, before I start \u2013 I want to share a personal story with you and my own experiences with inflammation.\n\nTo the point that I recently did over $30,000 worth of full-body stem cells to help reduce inflammation.\n\nYes, inflammation is that big of an issue that I decided to make a large investment in helping reduce this problem.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t have to go to such extremes (I had a lot of back and shoulder pain and didn\u2019t want to do surgery).\n\nAt the end of today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll reveal natural ingredients that support healthy inflammation\u2026\n\nMy Embarrassing \u201cZit\u201d Story\n\nAnyway, my relationship with inflammation first started back in high school.\n\nWhen the girl I liked, pointed at my nose one day and said, \u201ceww, that\u2019s a huge zit on your nose\u201d.\n\nAt this point, a few of the people around us kinda laughed and giggled.\n\nObviously, that situation was embarrassing, even though everyone was getting zits at that age.\n\nBut hearing it from the girl I liked\u2026 and those other people laughing at me\u2026 coupled with the fact that this was 2 days before the yearbook pictures were being taken\u2026 caused me enough pain that I needed to find a solution to this problem.\n\nThat night I called my uncle, who is a doctor, and I asked him if there was a prescription or something he can give me to fix my zits, especially if it can work 24 hours before the yearbook pictures.\n\nHe said no. And how the cause is due to \u201cinflammation and overproduction of oil.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cGenetics and hormones trigger pimples, but inflammation causes them.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cClean your face with Witch Hazel 2x daily and reduce eating foods that cause inflammation. Dairy is the worst \u2013 so no more milk and cheese.\u201d\n\nI thought, \u201cShoot \u2013 these are like my favorite foods, I eat them daily.\u201d\n\nBut, I did what he said and true to his word, my pimples dramatically decreased.\n\nAs far as the yearbook picture, I used some concealer. =)\n\nFast forward 10 years later when I noticed I was starting to lose a little bit of head hair.\n\nI was deep into medicine and health at this point and went to medical school.\n\nI did research and once again, studies revealed that \u201cgenetics and hormones trigger hair loss, but inflammation is a main cause of it.\u201d\n\nI was then reminded of that whole high school zit situation.\n\nAnd once again, I made changes/improvements in my lifestyle to control excess inflammation, added some medications and supplements \u2026 and my hair loss dramatically slowed down and stopped eventually.\n\nI also no longer had an itchy scalp or dandruff or any issues like that.\n\nAnd as a side note, wrinkles are also an inflammatory response. Too much UV sunlight triggers it in the skin, and inflammation then causes fine lines and wrinkles.\n\nMy Shoulder, Back & Joint Pain\n\nAnd this same story gets repeated years later when I have pain \u2013 my shoulders, knees, and the worst ones, my back pain due to herniated discs.\n\nAll inflammatory-related caused by years of working out with heavy weights, not using the best form all the time, and one other very important factor\u2026\n\nAging Is A Major Problem\n\nIn fact, science now has a name for inflammation due to aging, it\u2019s called, \u201cinflammaging\u201d.\n\nBasically, the negative hormonal changes due to aging, and the decrease in your \u201cyouthful hormones\u201d, increase inflammatory factors and triggers, which further accelerate aging.\n\nAnd when you think about it, it makes sense.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but it seems the older I get, the more pain I have.\n\nAnd thus, every few years I\u2019ve had to get even\n\nMORE strict with my diet\n\nchange & improve my workouts\n\nmanage my stress better\n\nand take even more supplements that support healthy inflammation.\n\nIt was a lot of work, and sacrifices, and also very expensive.\n\nTo the point that as I stated earlier, I recently spent over $30,000 to do full-body stem cells \u2013 one of the MOST potent anti-inflammatory solutions in the world.\n\nThere\u2019s A Simpler, Easier & Cheaper Way\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t need to go to such extremes or expenses as I have, to manage inflammation.\n\nNow, in part two, I\u2019ll reveal the top 3 causes of inflammation.\n\nThus, simply removing just a few of these daily, pro-inflammatory triggers from your life, will dramatically improve inflammatory response.\n\nFinally, in part three, you\u2019ll discover what to add to your life, to further manage excess inflammation.\n\nAgain, all are very simple, easy, natural, free, and low-cost methods.\n\nRemember, what you do NOT do, is just as important as what you DO.\n\nThus, reducing some of the negative pro-inflammatory offenders and adding in some positive anti-inflammatory tactics, will make dramatic improvements, much faster, and with far less effort.\n\nSaving you both time and money!\n\nThe end result is you\u2019ll look younger, you\u2019ll feel so much better and you\u2019ll dramatically reduce future health problems.\n\nWhat To Do Next To Quickly Manage Inflammation\u2026\n\nBelow, you can get more details about the exact formula I currently use to support healthy inflammatory responses.\n\nUse the same formula and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy inflammation & pain relief\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/inflammation-pain/how-effective-is-quercetin-for-reducing-inflammation/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to quickly talk about Quercetin:\n\nWhat is it and the benefits?\n\nHow well does it work, especially for a healthy inflammatory response\n\nCorrect dosages to be used\n\nWarnings \u2013 why most quercetin doesn\u2019t work or is a rip-off\n\nThe best and correct form and proper use for maximum benefits\n\nQuercetin is a bioflavonoid. More specifically, it\u2019s a pigment found naturally in:\n\nQuercetin is a potent antioxidant that helps fight free radicals, which are linked to numerous chronic health problems.\n\nNow, I personally use Quercetin because it helps boost the immune system, but primarily \u2013 because it\u2019s great at supporting a healthy inflammatory response, which is linked to pain and all the health problems I just mentioned.\n\nQuercetin & Inflammation \u2013 Does It Work?\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I want to focus on today \u2013 Inflammation, which I believe is a major cause of aging.\n\nAs with all studies, the results are mixed. Some say quercetin works and others say it doesn\u2019t.\n\nSo, I needed to dig much deeper into this.\n\nWhen using the correct dosage and form, especially when combined with other key ingredients, Quercetin works great for supporting healthy inflammatory responses.\n\nIn just 8 weeks, in human clinical studies \u2013 it greatly reduces morning stiffness and pain. As well as pain in the hands, shoulders, back, knees, and elbows.\n\nOne of the primary ways quercetin works is by blocking important inflammatory substances and pathways (including COX-2 and CRP), similar to NSAID drugs like Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Naproxen, etc. (but without the negatives).\n\nIt also helps block the production of prostaglandins, one of the key mediators of the inflammatory response.\n\nLastly, it works because it also reduces inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)\n\nWARNINGS: The REAL Problem With Quercetin\n\nAs stated earlier, when quercetin didn\u2019t work in clinical studies, it was because of the incorrect dose and form, which dramatically REDUCED absorption.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s not what you ingest \u2013 it\u2019s what you absorb.\n\nLike money \u2013 it\u2019s not how much your income is, but what you keep after all your expenses and taxes.\n\n50X More Bioavailable\n\nNow, the good news is that scientists have discovered that quercetin is utilized in a plant-derived phytosome delivery system, it\u2019s much more absorbable.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s 50x more absorbable than the standard quercetin found in most supplements.\n\nAnd the ideal dose of the phytosome version is 200 mg daily, versus over 2,500 mg daily of the regular quercetin.\n\nSo you\u2019ll actually save more money.\n\nTake It With Other Ingredients\n\nAdditionally, when taking Quercetin with other specific ingredients, the anti-inflammatory response is dramatically better.\n\nThe top ingredients research recommends are:\n\nTrans-Resveratrol (50% Extract)\n\nPycnogenol\u00ae (pine bark extract; 97% Extract; 65% procyanidins)\n\nApr\u00e8sFlex\u00ae Boswellia Serrata (65% extract)\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best, Easiest & Safest Option?\n\nSo now you might be thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take 5, 10 or 20 pills per day, buy a bunch of bottles and herbs\u201d\u2026 And I don\u2019t blame you \u2013 who\u2019s got the time or money?\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a natural option called Inflame & Pain Relief, which contains all the above key ingredients, at the correct scientifically researched dosages\u2026 in addition to a couple of other helpful ingredients.\n\nThe feedback for it has been amazing. It\u2019s a doctor-formulated option that has been around for years, so you know it works.\n\nIt\u2019s actually something I use myself and so do my own parents.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/inflammation-pain/quick-back-pain-relief-10-best-clinically-proven-solutions/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve had some sort of back pain my entire life.\n\nA primary reason starting at a young age is because I had, and still have scoliosis, which is a curvature of the spine.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be doing an article about this topic in the near future so make sure you read my blog regularly.\n\nAnother reason for my back pain is the fact my left lung is bigger than the right. This causes me to naturally tilt and \u201ccollapse\u201d to my right.\n\nThis puts stress on my left lower lumbar back because it\u2019s constantly trying to align and straighten me out.\n\nWell, add in years of working out incorrectly with heavyweights, I eventually got herniated disks in both my lower and upper back.\n\nBut the lower one is the part that\u2019s always causing me pain.\n\nSo much so that about 10 years ago I couldn\u2019t even get into my bed. I just slept in a chair. It was hell to even go to the bathroom.\n\nEvery doctor said I had to have surgery but I didn\u2019t and I healed the area naturally. It\u2019s not fixed, but I don\u2019t feel the pain hardly ever now.\n\nAnd the pain is all related to inflammation of the area.\n\nWhich is a primary cause of almost all pain is inflammation.\n\nSo, we for sure want to focus on reducing inflammation and I\u2019ve got really important information about this topic.\n\nHow to do it, what I\u2019ve done, the best solutions, and so forth.\n\nAnyway, today I\u2019m going to give you the best tactics and solutions I\u2019ve used to decrease my lower back pain and avoid surgery for over a decade now.\n\nStop Causing The Pain\n\nThe first thing we want to do is eliminate or reduce things that can cause back pain and inflammation.\n\nIf you\u2019re working out with weights, you need to really consider lessening exercises that compress the spine, such as\n\nI stopped doing all of these exercises and it\u2019s made a tremendous improvement.\n\nI also stopped doing heavy 45-degree leg presses, which can also put a lot of pressure on the lower back.\n\nThe other problem that causes tightness and inflammation is sitting too much. Especially since many of us sit behind a desk working on our computers.\n\nSo I got a standing desk, which helps. I switch back and forth between sitting and standing.\n\nSome people even have a treadmill desk. I don\u2019t know how you get work done like that, but you may give it a try.\n\nEither way, just make sure to get up often and move around to relieve tension on your lower back.\n\nAnother problem is not getting enough sleep and more so, having a bad bed.\n\nAlso, how you sleep is a big issue.\n\nGetting a bed that\u2019s too soft isn\u2019t good for your back, nor is one that\u2019s too stiff. If your bed is old, time to get a new one that works for your body.\n\nAlso, you should be sleeping on your back with a small pillow under your knees to reduce pain and curvature in your lower back.\n\nThis is what I do and it\u2019s helped a lot.\n\n\u2026 so, those are 3 simple things you should fix, to reduce causing factors of back pain and inflammation.\n\nOne way that I know I need to focus on doing more ab work is when my lower back starts to hurt.\n\nEvery time I get lazy and start missing my sit-ups and so forth, my lower back starts to get tight and hurts.\n\nSo, do your abs. Don\u2019t use weights. Feel the muscle.\n\nStart with the lower abs first and then finish with the upper abs.\n\nI\u2019ll do an article series about this as well in the future. So, make sure you check my blog regularly.\n\nMost of us have very tight hamstrings and glutes.\n\nSo, make sure you stretch them daily. Again, both hamstrings and the butt muscles.\n\nAll this sitting down shortens these areas and the hip flexors.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ll do an article series about this as well.\n\nHanging upside down is very helpful.\n\nI have one of these inversion boards and when I used it regularly, there were definite improvements in my back pain.\n\nBut, like anything in life, you need to stay regular. I forget to do it and the next thing you know weeks have gone by.\n\nOne of my first mentors was my chiropractor, Dr. Judy Lane. She\u2019s awesome and if she was close by, I\u2019d still go to her weekly.\n\nShe made HUGE improvements in my back. Always a leg was longer than another, back was out of alignment, and so forth.\n\nHowever, just like any professional or doctor, many of them aren\u2019t good.\n\nSo, you need to find a good chiropractor and make sure you hire someone that uses an activator to adjust your back, rather than cracking it into place.\n\nAn activator works with your muscles to align your back and it\u2019s better, safer, and longer-lasting.\n\nSpeaking of muscles, getting regular massages helps a lot.\n\nIn fact, my chiropractor said that massage was probably even more important for ME than chiropractic work because of my lifting weights all the time.\n\nAt the end of the day, back pain is inflammation and muscle tightness.\n\nSo, getting a good massage definitely helps!\n\nUsing both heat and cold therapy works too.\n\nThe cold reduces inflammation.\n\nThe heat improves blood flow.\n\nI suggest you start with an ice or cold therapy first, for about 10-20 minutes.\n\nThen a couple of hours later, do the heat therapy for 10-20 minutes.\n\nYou can just switch back and forth.\n\nTake An Anti-Inflammatory\n\nAs stated already, this is an inflammatory problem.\n\nHowever, I would not suggest taking painkillers to reduce inflammation because once they wear off, the opposite happens and there are MORE pain and inflammation.\n\nInstead, take herbal anti-inflammatories \u2026 things like curcumin, ginger, and other ingredients.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ve listed the best solution that I use for reducing inflammation AND pain.\n\nGive it a try, I promise you that you\u2019ll get quick relief, safely.\n\nBack pain is something that many people suffer from, some of us chronically.\n\nAnd the older we get, the worse the problem can get. So, you need to take action now before things get worse and it ends up turning into multiple herniated disks as I have.\n\nYou can stop the pain by:\n\nEliminating bad exercises.\n\nGetting better sleep.\n\nStrengthening your core and doing ab exercises 2-3x weekly.\n\nStretching your hamstrings and glutes.\n\nGetting a good chiropractor.\n\nDoing heat and cold therapy.\n\nTaking natural inflammatory solutions.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

Even though, the liquid is better because it\u2019s fresher and it also costs less.\n\nAnd make sure to keep your fish oil refrigerated.\n\nAdditional Benefits Of Omega 3\n\nNow, in addition to the testicular benefits of higher omega 3s, studies have also shown you live longer.\n\nFor example, Japanese men have 2-3x the omega-3 levels as Americans and they live longer. Granted, there are probably other reasons I\u2019m sure.\n\nBut here\u2019s something interesting, smokers who have a high index of omega-3 levels, have the same life expectancy as non-smokers with low levels.\n\nIt\u2019s as if the omega-3s are undoing the damage of smoking, I find that really interesting, don\u2019t you?\u2026\n\nNow, just imagine how much longer the non-smokers would live if they had high levels of omega-3s?\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t smoke, which I hope you don\u2019t and you take omega-3 fats, you\u2019ll live longer and have healthier testicles.\n\nWhy Omega 3\u2019s Make You Live Longer?\n\nWell, one big reason for this is that fish oil reduces inflammation.\n\nAging causes more inflammation.\n\nSmoking causes inflammation.\n\nStress, lack of sleep, and poor diet habits all increase inflammation.\n\nSo the goal here is to increase your omega-3 fish oils and reduce additional inflammation by taking specific herbs such as those found in Inflame & Pain Relief.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be like most people who just passively listen.\n\nTake action on what you\u2019ve learned today.\n\nImplement the tactics for reducing inflammation and improving testicular function.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...

Typical ones might be yeast, candida, and UTIs\n\nPoor Circulation This is a big one because it can negatively affect your eyes and thus, cause blurry vision. Tingling sensations in your hands and feet. Erectile problems in men.\n\nConfusion & Poor Memory Of course, as we get older, memory tends to not be as good. And one major cause of this is due to high blood sugar levels and your body and brain not being able to process and utilize the glucose as well.\n\nAt this point, you might consider seeing a doctor if you have these issues.\n\nMore importantly, please make important lifestyle changes to help promote healthy blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.\n\nPlease don\u2019t ignore this topic or passively listen. Take action. You don\u2019t have to make dramatic changes or take drugs to have healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nI\u2019ve posted lots of articles and videos at this website for improving blood sugar with diet and exercise.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re in a \u201crush\u201d and want something that works faster\u2026 That\u2019s simple & easy, you can add in specific vitamins & herbs that will accelerate results and promote healthy blood sugar levels, WITHOUT a change in diet or exercise!\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-flow/why-calcium-is-clogging-your-arteries-weakening-bones/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about how calcium is clogging your arteries and can cause so many health problems for your heart, brain and other organs.\n\nIt\u2019s linked to joint pain as well.\n\nPlus, hair loss and erectile problems.\n\nHeart Disease Is #1 Killer\n\nNow, If you\u2019ve watched my previous videos, you may recall I have a family history of heart attacks on my mom\u2019s side and strokes on my dad\u2019s side.\n\nBased on health statistics for the past 100+ years, heart disease is the #1 killer in the world \u2013 killing more people each year than all the other diseases combined.\n\nAnd coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease, which is what I\u2019m going to quickly talk about today.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s never ONE cause or solution to this or any health problem. For example:\n\nHigh and unbalanced cholesterol levels are contributing factors.\n\nHigh blood sugar and insulin resistance also come into play.\n\nInflammation is also a massive problem \u2013 both of which high cholesterol and blood sugar are causing factors.\n\nOf course, genetics always plays a big role.\n\nHowever, genetics aside \u2013 one of the most significant problems is the negative changes in your hormones due to aging.\n\nAnd, this makes sense when you think about it\u2026\n\nThis is why younger people rarely have cholesterol problems or die of heart attacks and strokes. They have youthful hormones that can fix a bad diet, lack of sleep, and so forth.\n\nThis is also why women who go through menopause suddenly start having all of these problems \u2013 high cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar\u2026 in addition to hair loss.\n\nAgain, negative changes in hormones.\n\nCalcium Buildup In Your Arteries\n\nNow, today I\u2019m not going to talk about improving cholesterol, blood sugar, or inflammation.\n\nInstead, I\u2019m going to talk about something most people rarely speak about and that\u2019s calcium buildup in your arteries.\n\nAnd how do you know if you have excess calcium in your arteries?\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you how in a minute.\n\nBut, there\u2019s also a secondary problem with calcium and that\u2019s the HARDENING of your arteries.\n\nHardened arteries lose elasticity\n\nArteries lose the ability to adapt to stress, such as blood pressure, etc.\n\nHardened arteries also put huge stress on the entire body, especially your heart and brain\n\nOne big problem is that hardened arteries and calcium buildup can also decrease blood flow \u2013 which affects your entire body.\n\nAnd yes, as I mentioned earlier \u2013 hair loss and erectile problems are both big problems.\n\nThis does NOT mean that calcium is bad. Remember \u2013 we want calcium to be in your BONES. So we have stronger bones.\n\nUnfortunately, as people get older, their bones get weaker and more brittle. One of the major causes of death in older people is falling and breaking a bone \u2013 such as hips and so forth.\n\nThus, the problem is that calcium is not being deposited in your bones, which is what we want and need.\n\nInstead, as we age, calcium is being deposited more into our:\n\nJoints \u2013 which can cause joint pain\n\nEyes \u2013 which can cause poor eyesight\n\nAnd Arteries \u2013 which control blood flow everywhere.\n\nThese are all the places we do NOT want calcium.\n\nHow Do You Know You Have Calcium Buildup?\n\nSo, as stated earlier \u2013 how do you know if you have calcium in your arteries and how bad is it, especially if you\u2019re over the age of 40 and certainly past 60?\u2026\n\nOne way is to get a calcium-score screening heart test or a coronary calcium scan.\n\nYou get a CAC score, which stands for Coronary Artery Calcification. You can ask your doctor about this test.\n\nIdeally, the result score would be 0. This means, NO calcium in your arteries.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people who are unhealthy, with a score of 0 \u2013 which is great. They have good genetics and hormones.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve seen people who are super healthy with high calcium scores \u2013 which doesn\u2019t make sense. But, again \u2013 genetics and hormones play a big role.\n\nSo, let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want to take this test for whatever reason \u2013 you don\u2019t have the time, the money, insurance, no doctor, etc.\n\nWhat can you do, to improve your calcium deposits in your bones and not in your arteries?\u2026\n\nWell, if your answer is \u201cnot take calcium supplements\u201d, that\u2019s not right. Remember, calcium has many benefits, as long as it\u2019s going to the right places \u2013 such as your bones.\n\nHowever, a supplement that is very powerful in proper calcium metabolism is a fat-soluble vitamin called, Vitamin K.\n\nNow, there are different forms of vitamin K. The two main forms are K1 and K2\n\nK1 is found mostly in plant foods, such as leafy green vegetables. It makes up about 75\u201390% of all vitamin K consumed by humans.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s very poorly absorbed, less than 10%. And, it has a very short active life, which means it only has an hour or two to do its job.\n\nThen we have K2, which has different subtypes \u2013 from Mk-4 through MK-15. Without making this long and boring, the most natural and absorbable form is MK-7\n\nSo, our goal is to increase Vitamin K2, in the form of MK-7. It\u2019s highly absorbable and has a long active life and thus, it\u2019s promoting healthy calcium metabolism all day long.\n\nThe #1 food that contains higher levels of MK-7 is a Japanese food made from fermented soybeans called, Natto.\n\nIf you can find this food and also like the taste of it, then try to consume about 3.5 oz or 100 grams of it daily.\n\nYes, it should be done almost daily and at the very least, 3x a week.\n\nBest Option For Vitamin K\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re like most people and won\u2019t be able to do this, then you might consider taking Vitamin K2, MK-7 in pill form.\n\nAdditionally, vitamin K2 is recommended to be taken with Vitamin D3.\n\nThis is a great combination for improving your health on so many levels, including healthy calcium metabolism and arterial health \u2013 which is what today\u2019s topic is about.\n\nThis benefits your entire body \u2013 heart, brain, organs, immune system, skin, hair and blood flow.\n\nBoth K2 and D3 should be taken together, with food, preferably in the morning.\n\nThe optimal daily dose the research has shown is 50 MCG of K2/MK-7 with 125 MCG (5,000 units) of Vitamin D3 daily.\n\nThis is the dose I personally take myself. However, if I\u2019m feeling tired or maybe I feel I\u2019m getting sick, I double the dose.\n\nI use a product called Perfect Vitamin D&K. It\u2019s got the correct dose, it\u2019s vegan, plant-based and it\u2019s the most absorbable and bioavailable form.\n\nThe sooner you start, the better.\n\nAnd yes, you can make improvements at any age.\n\nSo, again\u2026 it\u2019s all about being proactive, taking action daily so you can get results and live a happier and healthier life.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

You\u2019re either consciously or unconsciously doing this.\n\nWe want to live longer.\n\nHowever, if you ask most people \u201cdo you want to live to 100 years old?\u201d \u2026 Many people will say NO because they imagine a weak, frail, sickly old person who can barely move or remember anything.\n\nBut what if you could live to 100 and be healthy and thriving? You\u2019re still able to walk and do daily tasks. You still interact with other people. Your memory is still pretty good.\n\nAnd basically, you would die of old age. Not cancer or some painful disease.\n\nWouldn\u2019t you like that? Research has shown that most people will say yes, including me.\n\nBUT, is it even possible?\n\nThe answer to this is also yes because there\u2019s a lot of research studying centurions. These are people who live to 100.\n\nMost of them live in the \u201cBlue Zones\u201d.\n\nBlue Zones are regions in the world, where people live the longest.\n\nThe top blue zones are all over the world, such as:\n\nNicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica\n\nLoma Linda, California\n\nThe key factors contributing to their longevity include lifestyle habits and the environment they live in, rather than genetics.\n\nSo, you don\u2019t have to blame your genetics anymore.\n\nOnce I hit my 50s, I became very interested in this topic.\n\nI\u2019ve listened to hours of podcasts and videos about this and have read a couple of books on living a longer and happier life.\n\nAnd today I\u2019m going to summarize it all for you in just a few minutes to save you time.\n\n5 simple steps and easy action plans that you can implement today, so you can start to see and feel results quickly.\n\nMost of the diet of blue-zone people living the longest is plant-based.\n\nThis would be whole grains, greens, tubers, nuts, and beans.\n\nIn Okinawa Japan, one of the most studied Blue Zones, 75% of their calories came from purple sweet potatoes.\n\nNow, this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t eat meat or animal protein. It just means that the majority of your diet and calories should be plant-based.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to eat animal protein, eat grass feed, pasture-raised, wild caught. The more natural and the less processed, the better.\n\nDefinitely no processed, packed meats.\n\nACTION STEP: Eat more plants. In fact, eating just one cup of beans daily can add up to 5 years to your life.\n\nIMPORTANT: The most important thing about the diets of blue zones is that they cause low inflammation and blood sugar.\n\nIn fact, most health problems are related to high blood sugar and inflammation.\n\nIf you have a hard time following such diets for whatever reason, at least add in supplements, vitamins and herbs that\u2019ll help lower blood sugar and inflammation.\n\nPeople who live the longest, move the most.\n\nThey walk and ride their bikes. They garden, do a lot of housework. These are done daily and it\u2019s very natural.\n\nHowever, I also suggest you do resistance exercises 2-3x weekly to build muscle and strengthen your joints and tendons.\n\nThis can be with weights, machines, cables, or even bodyweight exercises.\n\nUnfortunately, as we age, we lose muscle mass and strength. This is called Sarcopenia.\n\nThis actually accelerates aging because your muscles are an organ and also help with blood sugar levels, mental clarity, reducing inflammation, and optimizing youthful hormones.\n\nGrip strength is another indicator of aging. The stronger your grip, the more youthful your body.\n\nAgain, this requires stronger muscles.\n\nACTION PLAN: All you need to start is 2-3x weekly, 30-60 minutes. That\u2019s it.\n\nAnd move as much as possible daily. Just walking alone, especially first thing in the morning and after meals will make a HUGE improvement in your health, by lowering inflammation, blood sugar, and stress hormones.\n\nHave A Sense Of Purpose\n\nIn Blue Zones, people have a clear sense of purpose, which can contribute to living longer.\n\nStatistics show that once a man retires from his job, they typically die within 5 years. Sadly, this happened to my dad.\n\nHe had no real reason to get up in the morning. He was bored. The day moved slowly because he had nothing to do, no purpose.\n\nThat can cause depression. That can cause someone to ruminate and have negative thoughts in their head.\n\nStaying busy and having a purpose is so important for your mental health.\n\nWarren Buffet, one of the richest people in the world and also one of the oldest at age 95, says he loves his job. He stated that he is \u201ctapdancing to work every day\u201d.\n\nCharlie Munger, his business partner felt the same way and died at age 99.\n\nAnd both of them lived a simple life, in the same house for decades. It wasn\u2019t the money, it was the purpose.\n\nHowever, it can be hard to find your purpose or passion or what gives you joy. I can\u2019t give that answer to you.\n\nI suggest you take some quiet time to think about this and reflect. Write down your thoughts in a journal or something similar.\n\nYour purpose may not come to you right away. But if you keep thinking about it daily and ask yourself the right questions, your brain will give you the answer eventually.\n\nStrong Social Connections\n\nLongevity in Blue Zones is also linked to close-knit communities. People regularly interact with family, friends, and neighbors.\n\nUnfortunately, in modern society, especially in the West, people are interacting LESS with each other because they are on the internet way too much. They communicate by texting, rather than having a conversation on the phone.\n\nThey don\u2019t make time to see each other, even if it\u2019s for a quick meal.\n\nMaking and keeping friends takes effort. This is especially hard for men because we aren\u2019t as social as women.\n\nMost of our friends are either from high school or the university. Or, co-workers, who may not be TRUE friends. They are work buddies.\n\nI personally have a hard time with this, especially since I\u2019m very introverted.\n\nKeep in mind that you don\u2019t need a ton of friends. Just 2-3 good friends are great.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget about family too. I know they can be a pain sometimes, but they are still family.\n\nPut in a little effort to interact with good people around you.\n\nAgain, even if it\u2019s a phone call or Facetime \u2013 that\u2019s a great start and better than texting.\n\nI think one of the most important factors in living a longer, healthier, and happier life is to manage your stress.\n\nI\u2019m not saying to NOT have any stress in your life, because that\u2019s impossible. The only time you don\u2019t stress is if you\u2019re dead.\n\nI want you to manage your stress with your mindset and actions.\n\nFor example, I don\u2019t want the news anymore. It\u2019s always negative, which is the job of the news. Because negativity gets eyeballs.\n\nBesides, there\u2019s nothing I can do with all of that negativity, and bad things happening around the world.\n\nI don\u2019t want to feed my brain and emotions, negative thoughts.\n\nNegativity grows like weeds in a garden. It requires no water or sunlight. It just grows like cancer.\n\nI also limit my interaction with negative, critical people. This one is hard, but over the years I\u2019ve gotten rid of a lot of negative people and I have NO regrets. I miss nothing.\n\nRemember, people are either going to reduce your stress or add to it.\n\nThe other thing with stress is your perception and the meaning you give to a stressful situation.\n\nIf you get in a car accident, that sucks. You can bitch and complain about it. Worry about your insurance rates going up. Not having a car for weeks and so forth.\n\nAnd that\u2019s totally normal and maybe you think those negative thoughts for a few minutes.\n\nBut, it\u2019s much better to focus on the positive.\n\nYou at least have car insurance. You didn\u2019t hurt anyone, nor did you get hurt.\n\nThis really comes down to an attitude of gratitude\u2026 Which itself is a muscle we need to flex more, to strengthen it.\n\nMost of us have strong negative muscles. Going to a bad place in our heads.\n\nBut we can change this by flexing the positive, grateful attitude.\n\nI just ask myself, \u201cWhat could be GOOD about this situation?\u201d\n\nAt first, my brain says, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing good\u201d.\n\nBut, I keep asking it, and eventually more positive thoughts and hope come out and then that takes over the negativity.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve done this so much that now my brain is trained to go to a positive question, \u201cWhat else could this mean?\u201d\n\nSo, I immediately go into solutions mode. I don\u2019t waste time on the problem.\n\nNow, let me quickly summarize everything for you.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve learned today and how people live to 100+ healthy years has to do with:\n\nLowering Inflammation\n\nReducing Stress Hormones\n\nImproving Blood Sugar Levels\n\nThis can be accomplished by the 5 following steps:\n\nEat mostly a plant-based diet.\n\nMove & exercise more.\n\nHave a sense of purpose.\n\nImprove your social connections.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/inflammation-pain/truth-about-omega-6-fats-inflammation-and-your-health/",
    "content": "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about how bad inflammation is for your health. It\u2019s linked to\n\ndecreased immune system\n\nand pain all over your body (joints, muscles, etc.)\n\nToday I wanted to answer a viewer\u2019s question about Omega 6 fats:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 I\u2019m confused about something\u2026 Some experts say oils which are high in omega-6 fatty acids are bad because they can cause inflammation. But then, other experts say they are good and we need to have Omega 6 fats. So what\u2019s the truth? Why can\u2019t anybody agree on anything?\n\nThis is a great question because of the mass confusion and misinformation about this topic.\n\nAdditionally, high consumption of omega-6 fats can also be toxic to your body and cause inflammation and all the problems I listed above.\n\nHowever, we DO need all the omega fats \u2013 3, 6, 7, 9, and so forth. However, it\u2019s all about the balance and ratios.\n\nWhat Are Omega 6 Fats?\n\nFirst, let me give you a list of so-called \u201cbad\u201d fats that are high in omega 6\u2019s, which are typically and incorrectly called, \u201chealthy\u201d vegetable or seed oils, such as:\n\nThe 3 worst are sunflower, corn, and soybean and these are found in most packaged foods.\n\nEven if you go to Whole Foods, you\u2019ll see these oils being used in the foods they prepare.\n\nAnd for sure every time you go out and eat, the restaurants are using these cheap oils.\n\nEven healthy \u201colive oil\u201d is typically mixed in with these unhealthy fats to save money.\n\nThese are cheap oils that are bad for you because they cause massive inflammation by creating an imbalance in the omega fats \u2013 being much higher in 6 and almost devoid of omega 3.\n\nFor centuries, our diets consisted of about a 1:1 ratio or as high as a 3:1 ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 fats. Which is fine.\n\nBut these days, it\u2019s at least a 20:1 ratio and as high as a 100:1 ratio of omega 6 fats to omega 3\u2019s.\n\nThus, a horrible imbalance and why there are so many health issues for your body and brain.\n\nAnimal Proteins Are A Problem For Inflammation, Too\n\nThe other issue is that animal proteins we eat \u2013 chicken, eggs, pork, and red meat, are also very high in omega-6 fats because of the horrible diets these animals are fed.\n\nThese animals are given soy and corn because they are cheap food, and they can fatten them quickly.\n\nThe animals are not free-range, or pasture-raised.\n\nThey\u2019re not eating insects and grass, like nature had designed them to.\n\nSo, this causes an even higher imbalance in the omega-6 fats and thus, MORE inflammation and health problems.\n\nAs the saying goes, you are what you eat. But you\u2019re also what the animal ate as well since that\u2019s going in you too.\n\nEating More Omega 3\u2019s Isn\u2019t The Fix For Inflammation\n\nSo these days, we\u2019re told to eat more omega 3 fats, to balance out the high omega 6\u2019s. But, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good idea either for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst, you have to consume a LOT of omega 3\u2019s, to counterbalance the high omega 6\u2019s.\n\nSecond, the best source of omega 3\u2019s is from fish. But, there\u2019s only so much fish you can eat, especially considering the heavy metals and toxins in our waters and so forth.\n\nThird, consuming a ton of fish oils, such as pills or liquid, isn\u2019t the answer either.\n\nWe are warm-blooded animals. Fish oils are for fish, COLD-blooded animals.\n\nThus, fish oils oxidize quickly in our bodies. Not a good idea.\n\nMaybe you can take between 2-6 grams daily and Krill oil might be better \u2013 but again, there\u2019s a limit before there\u2019s more harm than good, especially long-term for years and years.\n\nFourth, you can take oils higher in omega-3 fats, such as flaxseed, which is good. But most flaxseed oils are already rancid. They need to be refrigerated at all times. Most products aren\u2019t.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another problem\u2026\n\nIn order for the Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in plant-based oils such as flaxseeds, to have the same positive effects attributed to omega-3s found in fish oils, it must be converted by a limited supply of enzymes into EPA and DHA.\n\nAs a result, only a small fraction of it has omega-3\u2019s effects \u2014 10%\u201315%, maybe less.\n\nThe remaining 85%\u201390% gets burned up as energy or metabolized in other ways. And the older we get, the worse the conversion gets.\n\nSo, you have to consume a few tablespoons of flaxseed oil daily, to get the same positive effects of maybe 2 teaspoons of fish oil.\n\nThat\u2019s more oil, more calories, and more body fat.\n\nSo, after all, is said and done, here\u2019s what I suggest in order of importance:\n\nFIRST \u2013 you should try to eliminate or reduce these bad vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, and soybean. Read the labels, they are found in most packaged foods.\n\nSECOND \u2013 try to eat better animal protein. Wild-caught salmon is great. Make sure the chicken and eggs are pasture-raised and the red meat (cow, bison, etc.) is grass-fed. It costs more, but you need less protein and you\u2019ll be far healthier.\n\nIt\u2019s about quality, not quantity.\n\nYou can also take vegetable proteins such as Hemp, which has a little bit of omega 3\u2019s as well.\n\nTHIRD \u2013 consume about 2-6 grams of fish oil daily. Wild-caught salmon is best. Or, you can take the pills if you don\u2019t like fish.\n\nTo save money I use raw fish oil, but you can do the caplets if you prefer. I take a total of 1 tablespoon daily.\n\nFORTH \u2013 take supplements that support healthy & youthful inflammation, since that\u2019s really the whole point of improving your omega 3 to 6 ratios.\n\nYou want to take herbal extracts such as curcumin, ginger, Boswellia, Green Tea, Pine Bark, Astragalus, Resveratrol, Quercetin, and a few others.\n\nI take a natural veggie pill called Inflame & Pain Relief that contains all of these ingredients and a few more.\n\nThis is especially important if you want to reduce joint pain and inflammation, improve memory, and support a healthy immune system.\n\nMost importantly, if you aren\u2019t going to stick to a super strict diet, then for sure take Inflame & Pain Relief. It can dramatically undo a lot of the inflammatory damages caused by diet, stress and aging.\n\nReduce inflammation to live a healthier, longer, happier, and less painful life.\n\nAvoid foods and oils high in omega-6 fats\n\nAdd in more omega 3\u2019s,\n\nEat better sources of protein\n\nTake natural herbs that are scientifically proven to support healthy inflammation \u2013 this is especially important if you can\u2019t follow a strict, anti-inflammatory diet.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and inflammation continues to be a major health problem for most people, especially after the age of 35+\n\nInflammation is bad because it\u2019s linked to:\n\npain (joint, muscle, etc.)\n\ngut & digestive problems\n\npoor mood (sadness & anxious feelings)\n\nheart, blood sugar & blood pressure problems\n\nskin issues (rash, acne, etc.)\n\nBasically, many health problems are linked to inflammation because it accelerates aging.\n\nBut the main question is, \u201cHow do I know if I have poor inflammatory responses?\u201d\n\nOne way is to do a blood test and check your C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels. However, this isn\u2019t always accurate since it\u2019s giving you a snapshot of that specific day or recent times, not the long-term.\n\n10 Most Common Symptoms Of Poor Inflammatory Responses\n\nToday I\u2019m going to reveal the 10 most common symptoms of chronic and \u201cbad\u201d inflammation.\n\n1. Tired All The Time\n\nIf you\u2019re tired all the time, this can mean you have poor inflammatory responses.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re sleeping too little or even too much, both can create inflammation \u2013 especially being sleep-deprived which most of us are.\n\nExercising too much, all the time will also cause extra inflammation.\n\nThis leads to one of the biggest indicators of unhealthy inflammatory response and that\u2019s aches and pains. This can be muscular or bone or ligaments or tendons or joints.\n\nAnd this gets worse as we age and this is why it\u2019s also called \u201cinflammAGING\u201d\n\nOne of the most common ways the body lets you know something is wrong is through inflamed nasal cavities.\n\nAt first, it may seem as if you have a stuffy nose and you assume it is seasonal allergies or a simple cold.\n\nBut, since inflammation is the body\u2019s way of fighting off foreign substances and protecting itself, a stuffy nose could be a sign of unhealthy inflammation.\n\nNOTE: This is a problem that I personally notice.\n\nThis is a big one for most people due to bad, inflammatory diets \u2013 in addition to emotional stress.\n\nOngoing symptoms like stomach pain, diarrhea or gassiness could be signs of unhealthy inflammation, especially in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nRemember \u2013 food allergies, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn\u2019s, and similar digestive problems are all related to and linked to bad inflammatory responses.\n\nOver 30% of the population experience heartburn on a WEEKLY basis.\n\nAnd during times of stress, it happens more often and many times this is an unhealthy inflammatory problem.\n\n6. Brain Fog & Poor Mental Clarity\n\nBrain fog is characterized by confusion, forgetfulness, and a lack of focus and mental clarity. This can be caused by overworking, lack of sleep, stress, and spending too much time on the computer.\n\nAll of these causes also are linked to unhealthy inflammatory responses.\n\nMost people don\u2019t know just how bad inflammation is for your skin, this includes the scalp and thus, hair loss.\n\nInternal inflammation can reveal itself externally.\n\nNo one knows the exact causes of migraines and ongoing headaches, but scientists do know that one major cause is due to neurogenic inflammation, which is a type of inflammation in the brain.\n\n9. Metabolic Problems\n\nMany metabolic disorders are linked to bad inflammatory responses.\n\nOf course, all of these problems are linked to heart, blood sugar, memory problems, and so forth.\n\n10. Vascular & Erectile Problems\n\nIn addition to metabolic problems, chronic inflammation is also linked to vascular problems.\n\nThis has to do with unhealthy blood flow and circulation. This means cold extremities such as hands and feet. Or numbness.\n\nIn men, this can also cause erectile problems and impotence.\n\nThis is a problem my parent\u2019s and I have to deal with as well in recent times.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I recently did an article entitled, \u201cWhen drinking water is BAD for your health\u201d.\n\nIn today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll give you 3 specific times you should drink water, to improve your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nSo you can improve how you look \u2013 such as your skin\u2026\n\nHow you feel \u2013 such as your energy levels, blood sugar, blood pressure, and reduced pain and inflammation\u2026\n\nAnd simply to perform better all day long.\n\nSo let\u2019s get right to it.\n\n#1 Best Time To Drink Water\n\nThe very best time to drink water is first thing in the morning.\n\nWhen you wake up, your body is dehydrated and fairly acidic. We want to quickly reverse that, so you\u2019ll have more energy, your skin is hydrated, and we can alkalize your body because being overly acidic.\n\nSadly, most people screw this up by drinking coffee in the morning or some energy drink, which actually makes this situation worse.\n\nBy drinking anything with caffeine, you\u2019re making your body more dehydrated, and more acidic, and you\u2019re increasing your cortisol levels even higher.\n\nIf you want to dramatically increase your energy levels, and improve your memory, and cognition, there is a specific supplement you can take that I use personally \u2013 but, I\u2019ll give you the name at the end of the article.\n\nNow, you can just drink 2-3 cups of water to start the day.\n\nHowever, I make my own little drink and it has a lot of health benefits and it tastes pretty good too. I call it Dr. Sam\u2019s lemonade.\n\nPlus, it\u2019ll stimulate your metabolism, detox, and increase fat loss a little bit\n\nSo get up, and take at least 2-3 cups of water.\n\nAdd in a little bit of Himalayan or Celtic salt so that your body will absorb the water and it doesn\u2019t go right through you.\n\nThese salts have minerals, which is exactly what your body needs, especially in the morning.\n\nAnd NO, adding a little bit of salt, less than \u00bc of a teaspoon, is NOT going to raise your blood pressure. In fact, it\u2019ll help lower it and also reduce anxiety and stress hormones.\n\nThen add in some organic lemon juice to alkalize your body and make things taste better.\n\nYou can just buy pre-made lemon juice, which is what I do.\n\nAnd if you want, add in a tiny bit of vinegar to also help with acidity and to normalize blood sugar levels. I get the one that says \u201cwith mother\u201d on the label.\n\nAnd finally, I add a little bit of organic stevia to sweeten it. Makes this all taste much better and it doesn\u2019t do anything negative to your blood sugar.\n\nAnd there you have it. I actually drink this at least 2-3x daily.\n\nYou can make a big pitcher of it, like a gallon, and then do the same and your family can enjoy it as well.\n\n#2 Best Time To Drink Water\n\nThe second best time is before, during, and after exercise. And, you\u2019d better be exercising, so no excuses.\n\nIF all you do is go for a 20-30 minute walk, that\u2019s fine. Drink 2-3 cups and go for a walk. The water + walk helps detox and flush out toxins.\n\nIf you exercise at the gym and sweat and so forth, then you need to be hydrated.\n\nAnd for guys that want to get a big pump at the gym, my \u201cDr Sam\u2019s Lemonade\u201d will also help get you a bigger pump, and improve contraction and stamina.\n\n#3 Best Time To Drink Water\n\nFinally, make sure you have about 1 cup of water about an hour or 2 before bedtime.\n\nNow, you may be thinking \u201coh geez, I\u2019ll be getting up all night long and peeing\u201d.\n\nWell, by using my \u201cLemonade drink\u201d with the salt, you\u2019ll absorb the water.\n\nYou\u2019ll also alkalize and improve blood sugar and decrease blood pressure, again\u2026 all benefits while you\u2019re sleeping.\n\nHowever, most people don\u2019t realize that by staying hydrated throughout the night, you\u2019re LESS likely to get up, snore, wake up tired have headaches or wake up with pain and stiffness.\n\nOne last thing \u2013 make sure you drink water throughout the day, but do so in between your meals \u2014 NOT before, during or after, as I described in my previous article.\n\nSo make sure you drink water:\n\nFirst thing in the morning when you wake up.\n\nBefore, during and after exercise \u2013 even if it\u2019s just a walk\n\nAbout an hour or two before bed.\n\nAgain, I suggest you do NOT start your day with coffee, even if it\u2019s \u201cbulletproof\u201d. Make sure you get hydrated with water first.\n\nIf you want to increase your energy levels all day long and improve your mood, memory, and cognition, take a natural anti-aging, nootropic, \u201csmart pill\u201d supplement such as Body-Brain Energy.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect substitute and alternative for any caffeinated product (coffee, energy drinks, etc.) and it\u2019s actually GOOD for you.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/inflammation-pain/why-turmeric-curcumin-is-a-waste-of-money-unless-you-do-this/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today you\u2019ll discover the amazing benefits of curcumin & turmeric. In addition to the NEGATIVES, so you don\u2019t get ripped off!\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ll reveal why most of the supplements on the market are a total waste of time and money.\n\nI\u2019ve been ripped off personally\u2026 So, that\u2019s why I wanted to share my experience with you, so you can learn from my mistakes.\n\nWhat Is Turmeric / Curcumin\n\nCurcumin is the amazing active compound that is found within the turmeric root powder.\n\nTurmeric is the spice that gives curry its yellow color.\n\nIt has been used in India and many middle eastern countries for thousands of years as a spice and even as a medicinal herb.\n\nThese compounds are called curcuminoids, the most important of which is curcumin.\n\nSome will ask what\u2019s the difference between turmeric and curcumin and they are incorrectly used by many people.\n\nSimply stated, Curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric.\n\nBenefits & Negatives Of Curcumin\n\nCurcumin extract and NOT \u201cturmeric powder\u201d, have powerful health benefits:\n\nPotent Healthy Inflammatory Response: Most people take it for this primary reason. Inflammation is linked to pain, most health problems (body & brain) and accelerated aging.\n\nPowerful Antioxidant: Helps promote healthy immune function, including gut health.\n\nHeart & Brain Health: Both of which are the top killers in the world.\n\nHowever, despite all the amazing benefits\u2026 The curcumin content of turmeric is extremely low. It\u2019s around 1%-3%.\n\nAnd here is the first problem \u2013 in order to get the real benefits of the curcumin extract, you\u2019d have to take grams of the turmeric powder \u2013 which nobody will do.\n\nSo \u2013 never use turmeric \u201cpowder\u201d, unless you do so only as a spice.\n\nTherefore, if you want to experience the full positive effects & benefits, you need to take a supplement that contains significant amounts of curcumin EXTRACT.\n\nNow, the second problem is that curcumin is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\nBecause of this, we need to add in small amounts of black pepper extract, called piperine to improve absorption.\n\nAdditionally, since Curcumin is fat-soluble, it\u2019s a good idea to take it with food that contains a little bit of fat.\n\nBest Forms Of Curcumin/Turmeric Extract\n\nSo the first thing we want to do is take high curcumin extract and not the turmeric powder. So, READ the labels!\n\nNow, many products will say 95% extract. But even these are only 50% absorbed.\n\nSo you\u2019ll have to take DOUBLE the dose to get the benefits \u2013 which is a waste of time and money!\n\n3 Most Potent, Highest Absorbable Forms\n\nBecause I hate to waste time and money, I searched to find out what are the best, highest, and most absorbable forms of curcumin extract and my research revealed 3 of them \u2013 which are all clinically validated in human studies.\n\nCurcumin C3 Reduct\u00ae (standardized min 95% tetra-hydro curcuminoids) \u2013 One of the most active forms of Curcumin with 95% tetra-hydro curcuminoids, which is pre-converted and goes to work immediately.\n\nCurcumin C3 Complex\u00ae (standardized min 95% total curcuminoids) \u2013 Is a patented and clinically evaluated \u201cBioprotectant\u201d composition of three Curcuminoids [Curcumin, Demethoxycurcumin (DMC) and Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC)]. It\u2019s the most studied and clinically validated Curcumin extract on the market. This is more of a slow-release form, over 12 hours.\n\nBCM-95\u00ae Bio-Curcumin\u00ae \u2013 is clinically validated to have a 97% absorption rate and almost 9x higher bioavailability in the blood.. The end result is high blood concentrations, in less time. Thus, the positive effects are felt faster at an even lower dose, extended over 8 hours.\n\n\u2026 Now, it\u2019s hard enough to find just ONE of these specific ingredients in a product, let alone a product that contains all three.\n\nHowever, there is ONE organic supplement in the world that does have all 3 and it\u2019s called Inflame & Pain Relief\u2122.\n\nOther Important Herbs You Should Take\n\nHowever, what I really LOVE about Inflame & Pain Relief\u2122 and why my parents and I personally use it \u2026 Is because it ALSO contains other proven herbs that help support a youthful and healthy inflammation response.\n\nIt helps reduce levels of inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, interleukin-1b and interleukin-6.20-22\n\nIt also helps inhibit nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathways, which are involved in the initiation of chronic inflammation.\n\nThis supports healthy inflammation through a different mechanism \u2013 is a natural 5-LOX inhibitor, similar to drugs but without side effects.\n\nThere are over 400+ human studies showing the amazing benefits of Pycnogenol (a patented pine bark extract) because it helps support:\n\nhealthy histamine function\n\nThis means better joint mobility and discomfort relief.\n\nThis works by suppressing NF-kB and AP-1 signaling pathways, which causes inflammation.\n\nThis is one of the active ingredients in red grapes and wine. This helps support healthy inflammation in multiple ways.\n\nBlocks inflammatory COX enzymes \u2013 similar to drugs.\n\nAs well as 3 additional potent inflammatory agents \u2013 NF-kB, HMGB1 and STAT3\n\nQuercetin is a potent bioflavonoid that promotes healthy inflammation by blocking the negative effects of prostaglandins. The phytosome version is 50x more bioavailable than the standard quercetin supplement.\n\nWhen combined with the above ingredients, with the 3 specific forms of curcumin extracts I mentioned earlier, Inflame & Pain Relief\u2122 creates a \u201csynergy\u201d where you get even MORE benefits and faster results.\n\nSaving you both time and money, which is exactly what I love!\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best, Easiest & Safest Solution?\n\nSo now you might be thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take 10 or 20 pills per day, buy a bunch of bottles and herbs\u201d\u2026 And I don\u2019t blame you \u2013 who\u2019s got the time or money?\n\nFortunately, as I stated earlier, there\u2019s a natural product called Inflame & Pain Relief\u2122, which contains all the above key ingredients, at the correct clinically proven dosages\u2026 in addition to a couple of other helpful ingredients.\n\nThe feedback for it has been amazing.\n\nIt\u2019s a doctor-formulated and time-tested product that has been around for almost a decade, so you know it works and it\u2019s healthy for you.\n\nIt\u2019s actually something I use myself and so do my own parents.\n\nSo give it a try and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy inflammation & pain relief\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17044766\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9619120\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12490959\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21633179\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19594223\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10404539\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15489888\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17569207\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650394\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2504526/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3281036/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19233493\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23146777\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22481014\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16988474\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18462866\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2758121/",

    "content": "Collagen protein has become very popular recently, especially in 2025 \u2013 mainly for its muscle-building and anti-aging benefits. Here\u2019s a simplified guide to enjoy its benefits fully.\n\nFirstly, bone broth is the best choice as the source. When it comes to supplements, hydrolyzed beef collagen is the best.\n\nUsually, the recommended dose is 1-2 grams. However, if it\u2019s in a protein powder form, you can take up to 10-20 grams.\n\nYou can boost your production and absorption by adding vitamin C (500mg, three times a week) and hyaluronic acid (200mg per day) to your daily routine.\n\nHydration is very important. Make sure you are drinking a lot of water as it helps keep your skin and joints in good shape.\n\nAdditionally, controlling inflammation and keeping blood sugar stable is vital for anti-aging and living longer.\n\nAlso, getting enough sleep, lowering stress, and keeping hormones balanced are essential for a healthy body, looking younger, and feeling better.\n\nCollagen alone won\u2019t do the magic.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today I\u2019m going to reveal 5 best foods that help reduce pain & inflammation.\n\nWhen you have pain, it negatively affects your entire life. Of course, emotional pain can suck the life out of you and cause depression.\n\nBut so can physical pain in many ways because you can\u2019t do so many things in life. Heck, even sleeping can become a major problem.\n\nFor example, I have multiple herniated discs in my back, shoulder pain with limited mobility and knees and ankles that snap, crackle, and pop every time I go upstairs.\n\nAnd this is just from years of working out, wear-and-tear and of course, aging.\n\nThe good news is that over the years, my pain has actually improved. I was in more pain in my 30s than I am in my 40s.\n\nAnd soon I\u2019ll be entering my 50s, I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll have even LESS pain \u2013 while other people my age are going to be dealing with more pain and suffering.\n\nAnd the reason is that I\u2019ve focused 100% of my diet and supplements to help reduce inflammation \u2013 which is the primary cause of pain \u2014 in your joints, tendons, and ligaments, and also muscles.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to tell you the 5 best foods to eat daily to help reduce inflammation, which will dramatically help lower your pain over time and more importantly, help you avoid further deterioration of your joints, tendons, and ligaments.\n\nRemember, the older we get, the more inflammation and pain \u2026 In fact, it\u2019s called \u201cInflammaging\u201d.\n\nSo you MUST take action today and just apply some of the suggestions and tips I recommend, so you can live a healthier, longer and happier life.\n\nI\u2019ve also posted links about this topic at the bottom of this article that you can get access to for free, simply because I think this is a super important topic that all need to take action on, especially if you\u2019re over the age of 35.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started!\u2026\n\nWe have good and bad fats. Healthy fats actually help reduce inflammation and pain, while other fats cause the opposite.\n\nUnfortunately, most people eat unhealthy fats which I discuss in detail in a different article Basically, stay away from the usual vegetable and seed oils.\n\nBut today we want to focus on you eating more healthy fats such as:\n\nExtra virgin, cold-pressed olive oil\n\nWalnuts, Almonds, Macadamia nuts, and small amounts of hazelnuts\n\nJust like fat, we have good and bad proteins.\n\nThe best source of anti-inflammatory protein is wild-caught salmon. Anchovies and sardines are also good if you\u2019re okay with the taste. Halibut is okay too.\n\nMost other fish either have too much mercury or don\u2019t have enough anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats like Salmon does.\n\nRed meat causes inflammation, but grass-fed Bison is actually pretty good in small amounts.\n\nYou can also try vegetable protein sources such as non-GMO hemp and white-rice protein. But don\u2019t consume too much pea protein, because it causes inflammation.\n\nHealthy Carbohydrates\n\nAgain, we have good and bad carbs. High blood sugar levels due to eating the wrong carbohydrates or too much will cause a lot of inflammation, so keep this in mind.\n\nThe best are vegetables such as broccoli and spinach, these are two of the best.\n\nFruits such as berries are great. Pineapples and papaya are also fantastic.\n\nBeans are good, especially lentils. Make sure they are pressure cooked or soaked and drained for 24 hours before cooking to remove inflammatory lectins.\n\nAlmost anything you drink is going to cause inflammation. Low-sugar and green drinks are good.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s best to stick to water with some lemon and also green tea as your primary beverages.\n\n\u201cDrug-Like\u201d Herbs & Supplements\n\nAnd yes, there are some very powerful herbs and supplements that have \u201cdrug-like\u201d, healthy inflammatory benefits\u2026 Which can help improve longevity, reduce temporary pain, and improve mobility \u2026\n\nAnd do this without the negative side effects of drugs!\n\nThe most powerful ones that are backed by scientific research are:\n\nAnd a few other herbs and minerals. I\u2019ve put a link below to the best ingredients, how they work, the correct dosages, and so forth.\n\nPlus a product that I\u2019ve been personally using for over a decade.\n\nAgain, all links are at the end of the article.\n\nAgain, if you want to reduce pain and live a longer and healthier life, you MUST decrease inflammation. This should be your #1 goal right now.\n\nRead this article again. Implement just a couple of the suggestions and foods I\u2019ve mentioned.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t feel like making big lifestyle changes \u2026 if you\u2019re in a rush and you want much faster results, which I think we all do when we have pain\u2026\n\nThen you may want to consider taking a proven supplement such as Inflame & Pain Relief, which is what I\u2019ve been taking since 2008.\n\nEither way, whatever you do, do something to support a healthy inflammatory response and decrease your pain.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel so much better and younger!\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...

    "content": "This is part two of my Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) article series. If you haven\u2019t read part 1, please do so before you continue. Or at least, make sure you do so after reading this second part.\n\nWith that said, today I\u2019m going to reveal proven methods of fixing IBS forever. The people who have followed this \u201cblueprint\u201d have gotten long-term results.\n\nThis is based on personal experience with friends and family, in addition to clients.\n\nAs stated in part one, there is no permanent \u201ccure\u201d for it \u2013 as there isn\u2019t for most health problems.\n\nHowever, what you\u2019ll discover today will allow the IBS symptoms to be minimized to the point that you basically won\u2019t be dealing with them anymore.\n\nInflammation is The ROOT Cause\n\nBefore I start, I want to let you know that the underlying problem with IBS or other \u201cgut\u201d issues or stomach problems is inflammation!\n\nIn fact, inflammation is the root cause of many health problems.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s very manageable and FIXABLE\u2026 and I\u2019ll give you more details about how to reduce inflammation at the end of this article.\n\nAs discussed in part one, up to 80% of IBS issues are related to SIBO, which stands for \u201csmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth\u201d.\n\nIf you have this, you would first take an antibiotic, such as Xifaxan.\n\nUnfortunately, antibiotics will kill off ALL bacteria, including the good ones and this can cause fungus and yeast growth.\n\nSo, you\u2019d then need to take an antifungal drug, such as Sporanox.\n\nHow To Fix IBS \u2013 With Supplements\n\nAt this point, now we need to replace what\u2019s missing or imbalanced. Thus, we need to first fix the bacterial issue.\n\nThis means taking BOTH prebiotics and probiotics.\n\nI would then suggest taking MCT oil, more specifically \u2013 Caprylic Acid C8, not C10. All you need is maybe 1 teaspoon, 2-3x daily.\n\nTaking digestive enzymes with meals is also a good idea.\n\nAnd in between meals, you can also take L-Glutamine. I would take the powder to save money, about \u00bd teaspoon, 2-3x daily. Just put it in water. It has no taste. It also turns OFF your appetite, so that\u2019s another side benefit.\n\nHow To Fix IBS \u2013 With Food\n\nAvoid Dairy: I\u2019ve said it before, milk is for babies and cow milk is for baby cows. Dairy is problematic for almost everyone.\n\nAlternative: Instead, have rice or almond milk.\n\nRemove Sugar: try to eliminate all sugars in your diet, this also means \u201csyrups\u201d. Read labels. This also includes alcohol, juices, and even fruit.\n\nAlternative: If you want to sweeten your food, have Stevia. As far as fruit, limit it to citrus (lemons, limes) and berries.\n\nAvoid Vegetables: Yes, many vegetables don\u2019t do well with people. Especially cruciferous ones such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and even sauerkraut, which have lots of healthy probiotics.\n\nAlternative: Celery, spinach, yams, and sweet potatoes are good. IF you do eat vegetables, better to steam them.\n\nAvoid Legumes: Most people do NOT do well with legumes, especially when it\u2019s not made properly because they contain indigestible saccharides. It\u2019s a shame because they have lots of benefits \u2013 fiber, no sugar, protein, etc.\n\nAlternative: IF you do want to have small amounts of legumes, stick to lentils. And make sure they are soaked for one day or made in a pressure cooker.\n\nAvoid Gluten & Lectins: Gluten is a major issue for those who have IBS. And Lectins, which are found in many vegetables, also have the same problem. So, it\u2019s best to avoid them.\n\nAlternative: Make sure the carbs you eat, are gluten-free. For example, if buying oats, select the gluten-free ones.\n\nAvoid Omega 6 Fats: These inflammatory fats, which are typically vegetable and seed oils, such as soybean, corn, sunflower, and safflower being the most popular ones. Again, read the labels.\n\nAlternative: You need to have anti-inflammatory fats, such as omega 3\u2019s and fish oil. Better to have almonds, flaxseeds, olives, avocados, and so forth.\n\nCARBS: For the most part, carbs and sugars can be problematic, because they cause inflammation. The best carbs I think are yams and white rice. Small amounts of quinoa are fine. Berries are okay too.\n\nFATS: Higher amounts of healthy fats should also be your goal and less Omega 6 fats.\n\nPROTEINS: Lower amounts of protein, about 25% or less of your total calories should be your goal. The best protein sources would be grass-fed bison and beef, pasture-raised whole eggs, wild-caught salmon, and vegetable proteins such as Non-GMO, and organic rice protein.\n\nYes, I know this sounds very limiting, but you\u2019ll feel and look so much better and I think that\u2019s well worth it.\n\nYou\u2019ll heal your gut and have less inflammation. Then later, you can have small amounts of other foods without any negative issues.\n\nAgain, all of this is to reduce inflammation and thus, NOT \u201cirritate\u201d or \u201cinflame\u201d your bowel.\n\nI\u2019ve also got a multi-part email series I\u2019m working on, that will give you simple solutions for supporting healthy inflammation.\n\nOf course, this means fewer IBS issues. However, it also means:\n\nhealthier gut and brain\n\nAnd many more health benefits.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy inflammation & pain relief\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I want to quickly talk about Irritable Bowel Syndrome, also known as IBS. It\u2019s 2025 now and I\u2019ve noticed over the past year, I\u2019ve gotten dozens of questions about this topic.\n\nWhat causes it, what are the symptoms, how do I know I have it, how do I fix it, is there a cure for it?\u2026 and so forth.\n\nIt\u2019s a very important topic because IBS affects about 70 million Americans and obviously, many more people around the world.1\n\nSurprisingly, it affects women more than men.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve personally never had to deal with IBS. However, my brother and niece have and still do from time to time. I\u2019ve also had two girlfriends that have had IBS as well.\n\nSo, I have some indirect and personal experience with it.\n\nIBS is sometimes referred to as irritable or spastic colon or colitis or spastic colitis.\n\nIt is different from inflammatory bowel disease, even though at times it feels the same and has similar symptoms.\n\nWhat Are IBS Symptoms?\n\nIBS symptoms are similar to when you eat a bad meal and thus, you have\n\nExcess bloating and gas\n\nAbdominal and stomach pain\n\nConstipation and/or diarrhea\n\nFor example, if I have a glass of milk, I\u2019m 99% going to get all of these symptoms \u2013 gas, stomach pain, cramping, and diarrhea.\n\nNow, this doesn\u2019t mean I have IBS.\n\nIt just means I shouldn\u2019t be having dairy, especially milk. Or, it could be because I\u2019m lactose intolerant, as are most adults. It can also be because of the type of casein the milk has.\n\nFor example, cow milk is different than goat milk. In fact, cow milk has different casein in the US than it is in Europe.\n\nThis is why some people can have dairy when going on a European vacation \u2013 such as ice cream, but not at home in the US.\n\nNow, if you have these symptoms often, weekly, and especially daily \u2013 then yes, you have IBS.\n\nFood is always a potential cause of IBS. In a minute or so I\u2019ll tell you what you should avoid specifically and safe alternatives.\n\nAllergens also cause IBS, as do microbes, imbalances in the bugs and bacteria in your stomach/gut, toxins in your food, and so forth can all be causes.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s just ONE \u2013 like for me, it\u2019s the lactase in the dairy example I gave earlier.\n\nFor some people, it can be two or three or four different issues happening at the same time.\n\nThus, it can be hard to get a specific cause for each of us and usually, it\u2019s a combination.\n\nAnd this is why I\u2019ll give you multiple changes to make to help fix your IBS.\n\nPlus, the older we get, the more problems our guts have from years of poor eating and drinking, as well as medications.\n\nAdd in life stresses, and PH fluctuations in your stomach acids, and as you can see, it can sometimes become challenging.\n\nHowever, recent research suggests that \u201csmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth\u201d, also known as SIBO, may be responsible for up to 80% of IBS situations.2\n\nThe majority of your gut bacteria is in the colon, or that\u2019s where it SHOULD be.\n\nThe problem with SIBO is that the bacteria basically goes backward, into the small intestine.\n\nYou don\u2019t want this for a variety of reasons. One of the main ones is that you want the small intestine to be sterile and not backed up with this bad bacteria.\n\nThen, when you have carbohydrates and thus, sugar \u2013 the bacteria ferment the sugars in the food, and that causes bloating, gas, and so forth.\n\nThis overgrowth of bacteria can then lead to digestive problems, poor absorption of nutrients and foods, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and could even cause a leaky gut.\n\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a simple and noninvasive test to diagnose SIBO.\n\nYou basically blow into a special instrument and the doctor measures the amount of gas that\u2019s produced. They\u2019re more specifically looking for hydrogen and methane gas.\n\nGood & Bad News For Treating SIBO\n\nThe good news is that you can treat SIBO with antibiotics.\n\nThe bad news is that the antibiotics will also kill off all the good bacteria in your gut for many months, which can lead to other problems\u2026 such as yeast overgrowth.\n\nIs There A Cure For IBS?\n\nNow, there are solutions to fix SIBO as stated \u2013 which is the use of antibiotics, such as Xifaxan. You can also then follow it up with an antifungal drug such as Sporanox.\n\nOf course, then we need to fix the damage made by these drugs and I\u2019ll tell you how in a bit.\n\nHowever, the main question is \u2013 is there a cure for IBS? Or, are you going to have to deal with this for the rest of your life?\n\nThe truth is, there isn\u2019t really ever a \u201ccure\u201d for anything or most things in this life.\n\nBut, there are definite tactics you can use and implement, which can cause the IBS to be minimized to the point that you won\u2019t have any symptoms.\n\nHowever, you can live your life with little or no IBS-related issues and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to discuss in part 2 of this article series \u2026 How to fix your IBS, naturally \u2013 NO drugs.\n\nWith that said, make sure to read part two with the IBS Fixes.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal the top 5 foods that cause acne. I\u2019ll go over everything quickly and then do slightly more detailed articles about each specific food.\n\nI will also cover the causes and best supplements, topicals, and so forth in future articles.\n\nThus, this is going to be a multi-part article series about the causes and prevention of pimples and acne \u2014 at any age.\n\nWhether you\u2019re going through puberty or you\u2019re an adult.\n\nSo, if this is an important topic for you or you simply want more youthful and healthier skin, make sure to check my blog regularly so that you can see when I release articles about similar topics.\n\nBy the way, over 90% of people between the age of 11 to 30 get acne.\n\nOver 27% of adults get acne.\n\nAnd it\u2019s over 40% of adults if they work out and women going through menopause.\n\nI mention this to let you know you\u2019re not alone.\n\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\n\nWhen I was young, I had bad acne. I mean, most people do when going through puberty.\n\nBut mine was so bad that this one time, two girls, one that I really liked, pointed at my nose, laughed, and called me, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!\n\nIt\u2019s silly when I think about it now.\n\nBut back then, it was really hurtful.\n\nAnd so, that day started my obsession with having good, clear, healthy skin.\n\nSo, I went to the library and read up on the causes of acne.\n\nI then changed my diet, took supplements, and lots of different topical creams, and within a month or two, all my zits went away and I rarely ever got another one.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve learned a lot more about this topic.\n\nPlus, at the end of this article, I\u2019ve got some really important links you should take a look at.\n\nWhat\u2019s The REAL Cause of Acne\n\nSo, what\u2019s the real cause of acne? There are lots of factors\u2026\n\nGenetics \u2013 for example, my brother Henry had really bad acne growing up and so does his daughter and son. And ever since I\u2019ve told them what to do, they\u2019ve reduced it 90%\n\nHormonal Imbalances \u2013 higher levels of DHT, stress hormones like cortisol, and estrogen in men.\n\nBacteria \u2013 both on top of the skin, as well as gut bacteria.\n\nBlocked pores from poor skin hygiene\n\nHowever, the bottom line cause of acne is inflammation. All of these factors directly or indirectly cause inflammation.\n\nSo, you MUST control inflammation. I\u2019ve got more information about the best ways of supporting healthy inflammatory response below.\n\nTake a look at the end of this article.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll dig deeper in future articles as well.\n\nFoods That Cause Acne\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started with today\u2019s topic about the 5 worst foods that cause acne.\n\nBy the way, over the years there have been debates if diet plays a role in acne.\n\nHowever, recent research has shown that it does and this is because diet causes some of the problems I mentioned:\n\nWorst of all, Inflammation\n\nYou need to avoid or reduce refined carbohydrates and sugars such as:\n\nBread, crackers, cereals, and desserts\n\nSodas, juices, and anything with added sugars, syrups, and so forth\n\nI\u2019ll dig deeper into this topic in another article. But these foods cause hormonal imbalances and inflammation.\n\nOver and over again, the \u201cWestern\u201d diet is linked to acne. Up to 53% more than diets in other countries.\n\nThis means you need to avoid fast foods such as burgers, hot dogs, french fries, pizza, and similar foods.\n\nAs well as pre-packaged foods like pastries, muffins, snacks, chocolate bars, and so forth.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ll dig deeper into this in future articles.\n\nHowever, the cause is hormonal changes, inflammation as well as turning on gene expression linked to acne.\n\nI\u2019ve stated so many times in the past that you should avoid dairy products. Milk is for babies and cow milk is for baby cows.\n\nMany studies have linked dairy to acne severity. This also includes ice cream and ALL dairy products.\n\nDiets that contain high levels of Omega 6 fats, which is the typical Western diet, is linked to acne due to high inflammation.\n\nSo, you need to read labels and avoid fats such as Sunflower, Corn oil, Soybean oil, and cottonseed oil.\n\nUnfortunately, these fats are found in fast foods and pre-packaged foods because they are cheap oils.\n\nThe last food I want you to reduce is whey protein. This is the most popular protein powder. It\u2019s found in protein drinks and bars.\n\nMost people trying to gain muscle or lose fat, typically consume foods with whey protein \u2013 which is dairy.\n\nHowever, both research and my own views have shown that if you consume lots of whey, you tend to get more acne.\n\nSo, keep it less than 50 grams and preferably 25 grams of whey protein.\n\nAnd make sure it\u2019s whey isolate, so there\u2019s very little lactose in it.\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 the 5 worst food categories to avoid that cause acne because of hormonal imbalances, bacterial growth, and inflammation.\n\nRefined Carbs & Sugar\n\nFast & pre-packaged foods\n\nRemember, acne happens from the inside. Your skin is your biggest organ.\n\nSo unhealthy-looking skin means an unhealthy inside.\n\nMake sure you view the important links about supporting healthy inflammatory responses and eliminating the #1 cause of acne.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "There are a number of different painkillers on the market today designed to handle all type of pain under different conditions. It is true that different brands of painkillers will have different effects based in large part upon the types of pain and patients that they treat. However, when the pain is too severe to be controlled by over the counter drugs, then stronger medications must be used.\n\nOxycodone and Dilaudid are two such painkillers that are called narcotic drugs which can help people cope with severe pain. These are prescribed medications and must be given under a doctor\u2019s supervision. But which one is stronger or better for patients to use will depend on a number of different factors.\n\nAlso called Hydromorphine, this is a narcotic agent that is very similar to morphine. As an opioid analgesic, it has been used in a number of different clinical circumstances and is well known as a powerful painkiller.\n\nThis is known as a narcotic analgesic that affects the opioid receptors in order for it to bring its painkilling effect. The power of this particular painkiller is considerable, but there is also the danger that people can become addicted to this drug.\n\nSimilarities & Differences\n\nIn terms of how alike each drug is, there are very similar in terms of how they control pain and their overall effectiveness. Both drugs can be administered in tablet form or as a direct injection and they each have similar painkilling properties that may be difficult for patients to know the difference. Unfortunately, there is still the recreational use of each drug which is highly dangerous as it can lead to addiction.\n\nThere are differences between both drugs that will need to be taken into account before they are prescribed for use. Each drug comes from a different source as Dilaudid actually come from morphine which is why it has a very similar effect. Oxycodone however comes from thebaine which is a different source even though it is in the same family of opiate drugs.\n\nDilaudid is over twice as strong as Oxycodone and therefore is often prescribed in lower doses. In fact, Dilaudid is basically five times as strong as morphine whereas Oxycodone is less than two times as strong. In addition, Dilaudid is the preferred choice for those who have their kidney functions impaired because it contains fewer toxins.\n\nOverall, for those who are considering switching from Oxycodone to Dilaudid and vise versa must keep in mind the differences in their relative strengths. While switching from Dilaudid can lead to having lower doses and effectiveness of the new drug, going from Oxycodone up to Dilaudid can be dangerous is the amount of the dosage is not subsequently reduced. Overdosing on either drug may lead to excessive drowsiness, difficulties in breathing to coma and even death depending on the circumstances.\n\nYou should consult with your doctor in making the switch from one painkiller to the other and understand the differences that each of them presents.",

    "content": "It may seem on the surface that both dilaudid and morphine are the same as both provide pain relief to the body and they are seen as addictive drugs with effects cited as being as strong as heroin. However, there are differences between them as well in terms of strength and their usage which means that which one is taken is very important.\n\nThis product is created from poppy plants and is used as an opiate while dilaudid is really synthesized from morphine after it has been processed. As with dilaudid, morphine has certain side effects which include drowsiness, euphoria, congnitive disorder and depression. In terms of side effects, the differences between morphine and diluadid are actually quite small and will depend more on the person taking the drug. However, it is possible to switch from one to the other and downplay or even eliminate some of the side effects.\n\nThis is a brand of hydromorphine that is often classified as a semi-synthetic drug. It is actually a member of the family of morphine drugs, but it was not created until about a century after morphine was first used. While similar in many respects, the drug is actually metabolized by the body in a different manner than morphine itself.\n\nSimilarities and Differences\n\nBoth drugs are well known for their pain relief qualities. However, they are also quite well known for being abused by drug addicts. Each drug is used in hospitals and clinics around the world and is somewhat similar in nature, although there are considerable differences as well.\n\nDilaudid is roughly three to four times as strong as Morphine which means it provides a more powerful form of pain relief. However, morphine is generally the first drug that is prescribed in order to gauge whether the patient will need a more powerful drug later on for the pain. However, dilaudid offers fewer side effects than morphine which is well noted for its disruptive effects on the mind and body.\n\nIt is true that dilaudid is more soluble which means that it takes effect faster than morphine which is why it is preferred after a patient undergoes a major surgery as that might cause a great deal of pain. Plus, dilaudid is believed to be less addictive and therefore safer to use over time than morphine. There are similarities in the side effects to both drugs as they work on the same basis. The feeling of euphoria is one that both drugs share which makes them addictive to certain patients, especially when taken in amounts that exceed recommended doses.\n\nOverall, the differences between dilaudid and morphine are substantial, but also ones that dictate their use among physicians. However, their similarities are also very present as well which means that for most people choosing between one or the other may be a small consideration. In all likelihood you will be given morphine for most types of pain first while dilaudid is reserved either for major surgery or when morphine is not enough of a pain reliever. So, asking for dilaudid first may not be what is recommended.",

    "content": "When it comes to pain relief, particularly for chronic pain that has been experienced for a long period of time, two of the more popular pain relievers are Lortab and Percocet. Each pain reliever is somewhat similar in makeup, but there are differences that you will need to be aware of before choosing with drug is right for your needs.\n\nPercocet is the older drug having first been approved in 1976 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the turn of the 21st century, Percocet was available in six different types of dosages that could be taken orally for the relief of chronic pain. It was recommended by an FDA advisory panel that Percocet be limited in its sales due to the number of deaths attributed to acetaminophen in the US every year. While the annual number was around 400 which is a fairly small percentage, it was deemed dangerous enough to invoke a limitation of the drug itself.\n\nLortab also contains acetaminophen, but was not produced in the US until well after Percocet hit the market. Still, it does contain many of the same ingredients and does fall under the same limitations in terms of dosages and uses just like Percocet. Side effects include nausea, constipation, vomiting and dry mouth. Vicodin is another name for Lortab and it does have well known addictive qualities, particular for those who have taken it over a long period of time for relief of their chronic pain.\n\nThe Differences Between Lortab and Percocet\n\nOn the surface there is actually very little difference between each drug as they have somewhat similar properties. However, Percocet is a combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone while Lortab is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. While they may sound similar, oxycodone is actually a little stronger than hydrocodone so technically speaking Percocet should be a stronger painkiller than Lortab.\n\nHowever, the difference in terms of overall strength is not all that much and everyone reacts differently to pain killing drugs. In essence, this means that some people will react better to the hydrocodone than the oxycodone despite the overall differences in strength. So, choosing the better one for you will require a little experimenting with your doctor to see what effects the chemicals will have on the body.\n\nIf you have had bad experiences with oxycodone in the past, then you do not want to take Percocet at all. In fact, you may want to try neurostimulators instead of painkilling prescriptions if you do not want to take drugs at all. However, for those who are looking at chronic pain relief in particular, both Lortab and Percocet are well suited for the task.\n\nOverall, the differences between Lortab and Percocet are actually rather minimal by comparison, but Percocet is somewhat stronger which may make it a more effective drug. However, both prescriptions should be taken with care as they do contain addiction causing properties. So, be sure to speak to your doctor about which one is right for your needs.",

    "title": "Tramadol Versus Vicodin | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health-se/tramadol-versus-vicodin/",
    "content": "When it comes to pain relief, both Tramadol and Vicodin are two very popular brands. Tramadol is actually the generic name for an opiate analgesic while Vicodin is the brand name for the combination for acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Both are used to relieve moderate to severe pain, although Vicodin is a narcotic painkiller which means that there is a risk of dependency. In addition, both of these drugs are prescription only.\n\nBeing an opiate analgesic that contains serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, this particular drug also has a number of different brand names as well which include Rysolt, Conzip, Ultram and Ultracet. You\u2019ll find Tramadol used in tablet and capsule form with different levels of dosages depending on the type of pain that is being treated. Vicodin also comes under the brand names of Lorcet, Hycet, Maxidone, Zamicet, Zydone and Norco to name a few and comes in many different forms that includes syrup for short term use.\n\nDifferences Between Tramadol and Vicodin\n\nEssentially, while both drugs address the same basic issues of moderate to severe pain, there are differences in the composition of each medication.\n\nTramadol releases serotonin and is a reuptake inhibitor of norepinephrine which affects how the brain perceives pain. While this is a very effective means of controlling pain, the drug may also be addictive and habit forming as well which means that it must be administered under careful consideration from your doctor.\n\nVicodin is different in effect because it is a semi-synthetic narcotic and opioid painkiller which means that it changes the way the brain responds to pain. Like Tramadol however, it also can be addictive and must be carefully administered otherwise it may become habit forming. Both drugs are similar in that they are taken every four to six hours for pain relief. However, Tramadol is generally only prescribed at 400mg per day while Vicodin can be prescribed at up to 4,000mg per day.\n\nWhat Are the Side Effects?\n\nIn terms of overall effect, double blind studies have demonstrated that Vicodin may have a stronger effect overall as it does seem to relieve pain faster and in a more complete manner than Tramadol. However, this may be due to the overall dosage and just how it fools the brain into perceiving pain. Still, such studies are generally not totally reliable because people perceive pain differently as well as their treatments. What might be tolerable for one person may be agony for another, so precise studies on the effects are not possible as of this time.\n\nBesides allergic reactions, both drugs have different side effects as well. Tramadol may cause dizziness, feelings of weakness and difficulty falling asleep in terms of its lighter side effects. Vicodin may also cause dizziness, but also light-headedness, nausea, vomiting or an abrupt change in mood.\n\nDeciding which one you should take will depend in large part on what your doctor prescribes. This will mean taking into account your medical history which should include your previous use of similar drugs and your reaction to them.",

    "content": "This is part 3 in my inflammation and pain reduction article series.\n\nPart 1 I discussed how the #1 cause of aging and illnesses is inflammation. Something that\u2019s affected by lifestyle and more so, the negative changes in your hormones due to aging!\n\nPart 2, I revealed the top 3 causes of inflammation.\n\nAnd today, I\u2019ll give you the 4 best ways to reduce inflammation.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read the other 2 articles, click on the links above. You can see them first and then come back to this. Or, make sure to read them after this article.\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Foods (Eat These)\n\nAs stated in part 2, food plays a huge role in inflammation. Foods you should NOT eat, which I discussed in part 2 \u2013 is just as important as the foods you SHOULD eat, which are:\n\nVegetables: steamed broccoli, kale, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, etc\n\nFruit: especially deeply colored berries like grapes and cherries (NO juice)\n\nHigh-fat fruits: avocados and olives\n\nHealthy fats: olive, macadamia nut, coconut, and fish oil\n\nFatty fish: salmon, sardines, herring, mackerel, and anchovies\n\nNuts: almonds, walnuts, and macadamia nuts\n\nPeppers: bell peppers and chili peppers (remove the skin and seeds)\n\nSpices: turmeric, ginger, fenugreek, cinnamon, etc. More on this in a minute.\n\nBasically, you want a\n\nprotein coming from seafood.\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Exercises (Do These)\n\nI told you what forms of exercise to avoid, reduce, or cycle in part one. As far as the best exercises.\n\nAerobic \u2013 I think brisk walking, outside is the best. Also using a rebounder is great, especially if you don\u2019t feel like going outside for whatever reason.\n\nAnaerobic \u2013 I personally believe resistance exercise is the best form. And when you lift weights, there is inflammation and that helps with muscle growth. However, the secret is to make sure you cycle your workouts.\n\nDon\u2019t go heavy and intense all the time. Do higher rep and lower volume workouts too. Make sure you also take off 2-3x weekly to reduce inflammatory factors back down to baseline.\n\nAnd take anti-inflammatory supplements after your workouts. This will help speed up recovery and muscle growth as well.\n\nStress Management To Reduce Inflammation\n\nStress can\u2019t be fully avoided, but it can be managed.\n\nStop interacting with negative things \u2013 this includes things like the news, people, and situations. At the very least, reduce these negative stressors.\n\nInstead, surround yourself with more positive people, watch funny shows and movies, and consume more self-help, self-improving information.\n\nTrust me, you have more control over this than you think.\n\nJust this past year I\u2019ve gotten rid of 2 long-term friends that were just too negative and toxic to be in my life. And I feel great about it. I haven\u2019t missed out on anything.\n\nAnd remember, sleep is key.\n\nStop looking at your phone, tv and similar bright objects 30 minutes before bed. At least, dim things.\n\nMake sure your room is dark and quiet. I wear eyeshades and earplugs and it\u2019s made a huge improvement in my sleep.\n\nFinally, there are many powerful herbs and vitamins that are clinically proven to lower inflammatory factors.\n\nHerbs such as curcumin, ginger, Boswellia, green tea, white willow bark, Resveratrol, and others.\n\nI\u2019ve personally been using Inflame & Pain Relief for over a decade.\n\nIt\u2019s by far the best supplement because it\u2019s the only all-in-one solution that helps reduce the 14 primary inflammatory triggers in your body.\n\nIt saves you time and money.\n\nIt\u2019s clinically researched and works fast. In fact, blood tests show improvements in inflammation in less than 14 days!\n\nGive it a try and let me know how it works for you\u2026\n\nHowever, one thing I do want to mention is that no matter what you do, inflammation is a part of aging. This means, that the older we get, the more inflammation and this is why we get so many health problems as we get older.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s called \u201cInflammaging\u201d.\n\nSo, you better take action right now and improve your lifestyle by utilizing just a few of the improvements I\u2019ve mentioned in this article series.\n\nThe end result is you\u2019ll look and feel younger, you\u2019ll age better and probably live a much healthier and longer life, with fewer aches and pains, and a sharper brain.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy inflammation & pain relief\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

However, here\u2019s what the study revealed:\n\nFor women not taking painkillers, the risk of developing blood pressure problems levels was only about 1-3 percent a year.\n\nWomen taking 400 mg a day of over-the-counter painkillers (the equivalent of two ibuprofen) had a 60-78 percent increased risk of developing blood pressure problems.\n\nWomen taking an average daily dose of 500 mg of acetaminophen (one extra-strength tablet) had a 93-99 percent increased risk of developing blood pressure problems within three years.\n\nThe cause of this is because of fluid retention and decreased kidney function due to these drugs.\n\nWhy Is It Worse For Women?\n\nThis is because women have smaller blood vessels in the heart, making them more vulnerable to blood pressure problems and inflammation of the blood vessels.\n\nNow, aging causes blood pressure problems for BOTH men and women.\n\nHowever, as women get closer to menopause, there is a dramatic drop in estrogen, which causes a woman\u2019s arteries to become less elastic and more constrictive, thus contributing to blood pressure problems.\n\nUnfortunately, giving women synthetic hormones (estrogen and especially progesterone) makes this situation only worse.\n\nYou should only take these drugs occasionally, as needed, and definitely not daily or more than 3x weekly.\n\nBy the way, aspirin does not cause blood pressure problems, but it has its own set of negative side effects, such as stomach pain, ulcers, excessive bleeding, becoming acidic, etc.\n\nMost pain is related to inflammation. So drinking more water, and taking higher dosages of Vitamin C, Magnesium and Curcumin will help.\n\nLastly, make SURE you support healthy blood pressure using natural solutions, especially if you\u2019re over the age of 40 \u2013 both men and women.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the primary causes of heart and brain aging.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

They are types of carbohydrates that humans can\u2019t digest.\n\nBasically, prebiotics is food that helps grow and strengthen the good, friendly bacteria in your gut.\n\nBy ingesting both probiotics and prebiotics, you\u2019ll improve your gut flora, which improves all of your health.\n\nAs stated in my previous article, healthy gut bacteria affects\n\nYour skin \u2013 Pimples, hair loss, wrinkles, and discoloration\n\nGaining muscle and losing fat\n\nImproving your mood and being happier\n\nBoosting your immune system\n\nHaving better hormones\n\nReducing pain and inflammation\n\nHealthier colon and regularity\n\nYup, your gut bacteria affects all of these factors.
