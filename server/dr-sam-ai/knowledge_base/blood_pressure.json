    "content": "Today you\u2019ll discover 3 specific acupressure points that can instantly help improve your blood pressure \u2013 anytime, anywhere!\n\nI\u2019ve decided to update this topic in 2025, because having healthy blood pressure is a very important topic not only for avoiding heart problems but simply for longer life.\n\nAnd personally speaking, this is very important for me because I have a family history of blood pressure problems.\n\nThe good news is that there are lots of simple ways to support healthy blood pressure, naturally. And today I\u2019m going to reveal 3 simple pressure points in your body, that will help with blood pressure.\n\nSomething important that I want to bring to your attention about today\u2019s topic is that these solutions are for instant results, NOT long-term solutions.\n\nSo if you\u2019re feeling stressed or your blood pressure is rising, you can almost instantly and quickly use today\u2019s 3 pressure points to help with blood pressure and help avoid anything bad from happening.\n\nIf nothing else, you\u2019ll get instant relief and relaxation.\n\nLower Blood Pressure \u2013 Acupressure Point LI4\n\nLI 4, which stands for \u201cLarge Intestine 4\u201d, is an extremely useful acupressure point that is extensively used to treat chronic pain, acute stress, and various types of diseases along with treatment for blood pressure problems.\n\nThis point is situated in the webbing between the forefinger and the thumb\u2026 right in the middle as you see here. It calms and balances blood flow throughout the body and clears stagnation.\n\nAs an added benefit, it also boosts your immunity.\n\nThe most effective way to apply pressure to LI 4 is to slide your thumb along the webbing until you reach the junction of the thumb and index finger bones.\n\nBegin by moving your thumb in a small circular rubbing motion over LI 4 for a few seconds. Then you can apply gentle to moderate thumb pressure depending on how sensitive the area feels. If there is any pain, it should be a \u201cgood hurt,\u201d not severe or uncomfortable.\n\nYou can hold the point as long as you are comfortable, up to several minutes. I typically suggest about 20-30 seconds, then take a few-second break and then repeat as often as you\u2019d like.\n\nLower Blood Pressure \u2013 Acupressure Point PC 6\n\nPC 6 or Pericardium 6 is yet another important acupressure point for supporting healthy blood pressure. It soothes and helps the heart and circulatory system in their proper functioning.\n\nThis point is also known as the Inner Gate, and it is located on the inner forearm, approximately three finger-widths away from the wrist crease as you see here.\n\nThis point can be stimulated by applying firm pressure to the point using your index finger or thumb.\n\nAgain, apply pressure for about 20-30 seconds, then take a break and repeat as needed.\n\nLower Blood Pressure \u2013 Acupressure Point G20\n\nThe G20 is below the base of your skull, in the hollows on both sides of the neck, between the two vertical neck muscles.\n\nPutting pressure here supports healthy blood pressure, and reduces headaches and stress by relaxing your nervous system.\n\nUse your thumbs, fingers, or knuckles to gradually apply pressure into the hollows of your skull.\n\nClose your eyes as you tilt your head back slowly. Take long, slow deep breaths as you hold for two to three minutes. Direct the pressure slowly and firmly into the center of your head.\n\nOther Blood Pressure Lowering Acupressure Points\n\nNow, there are lots of other acupressure points \u2014 on your feet, arms, legs, and so forth. I picked these 3 areas for healthy blood pressure because you can do them anywhere, any place \u2014 they\u2019re easy to access.\n\nIt\u2019s just your hand, forearm/wrist, and the back of your head.\n\nEasy access, you can do it yourself and you\u2019ll get fast relief.\n\nLong-Term Blood Pressure Lowering Results\n\nAs stated earlier, these pressure points should be stimulated for quick relief, usually during times of stress.\n\nHowever, this will not fix your blood pressure problems throughout the day, especially when you\u2019re sleeping.\n\nSo you should be utilizing other natural treatments that can help support healthy blood pressure within a normal range.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

That\u2019s because they \u201cfeel fine\u201d\u2026\n\nA blood pressure problem is known as the \u201csilent killer\u201d because most people can\u2019t feel the negative effects. Yet, as you\u2019ll see in the below info-graphic, how blood pressure affects your entire body in a very negative way.\n\nI\u2019m very familiar with this topic because I have a family history of blood pressure problems \u2014 including myself and my dad. So I know the importance of supporting healthy blood pressure levels for a healthier heart, as well as your ENTIRE BODY!\n\nHaving blood pressure problems makes your heart work harder, which over time makes your heart grow weaker because it gets \u201cworn out\u201d and tired!\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s like your car engine, always going at maximum speed, high RPM. It\u2019ll break down sooner.\n\nAnd the negative effects of a weaker heart can be felt throughout your entire body!\n\nThere are lots of reasons to support healthy blood pressure. A primary one is simply for improved total health and longevity. However, below are my top 6 reasons\n\nyou have a family history of blood pressure problems\n\nyou\u2019re concerned about heart problems\n\nyou\u2019re over the age of 40\n\nyou\u2019re concerned about osteoporosis and want stronger bones\n\nyou have low stamina, lower strength, and get tired quickly\n\nyou are overweight and need to lose unwanted body fat\n\nObviously, you must support healthy blood pressure if it\u2019s elevated and it\u2019s best to do it naturally\u2026 Because as I\u2019m sure you already know, blood pressure medications have a ton of negative side effects such as1:\n\nlowered immune system\n\nfeeling tired, weak, drowsy or lack of energy\n\ndigestive problems (gas, bloat, diarrhea or constipation)\n\nlowered libido (men/women), vaginal dryness (women)\n\nanxiety, feeling nervous or sadness\n\nheadaches, dizziness, brain fog\n\nAs you can see, even though blood pressure drugs may improve your blood pressure readings, they cause a bunch of other negative side effects.\n\nThe good news is you can support healthy blood pressure naturally, the way I did for my dad and myself.

    "content": "Having healthy blood pressure is a very important topic\u2026 not only for avoiding heart problems but simply for a longer life. The higher your blood pressure, the faster you\u2019re aging!\n\nThat\u2019s why I decided to redo this topic in 2025.\n\nPlus, blood pressure problems cause fatigue, hair loss, impotence, memory problems, inflammation, and lots of other ailments that negatively affect the quality of your life.\n\nAnd personally speaking, this is very important for me because I have a family history of blood pressure problems.\n\nThe shocking statistics reveal that 33% of Americans over the age of 20 have blood pressure problems.1 And 90% have blood pressure problems by age 65.1,2\n\nAnd YES, age and the negative changes in your hormones due to aging are a primary cause of blood pressure problems.\n\nAnd worst of all, 72% of people don\u2019t even know they have blood pressure problems.2\n\nSo statistically speaking, if you\u2019re reading this article\u2026 you probably do NOT have healthy blood pressure levels and you need to lower it!\n\nAnd the bigger problem is that blood pressure has no warning signs or symptoms. People think blood pressure causes headaches or dizziness, but these are rare.\n\nAnd this is why it\u2019s is called the \u201csilent killer\u201d.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Solution?\n\nOkay, so now we know just how bad it is \u2013 so, what are the solutions?\n\nIn a previous article, I covered all the various drug options and how they all have negative side effects.\n\nThey\u2019re okay in the short term to help support healthy blood pressure. However, it\u2019s not a long-term solution by any means.\n\nLifestyle improvements \u2013 Better diet, more exercise, stress management and losing weight are all very important \u2013 simply for a healthier life.\n\nUnfortunately, for many people \u2013 lifestyle improvements take a lot of effort, time, and money. Additionally, the resulting blood pressure isn\u2019t very big. So people are left disappointed and frustrated.\n\nA Faster, Easier Solution\n\nAnd this is where supplements come in. The correct herbal extracts, vitamins, and minerals can help support healthy blood pressure quickly and naturally, in a short amount of time \u2026 with the least amount of effort.\n\nAnd this is what we all want. And because of this, people are able to lower their blood pressure and KEEP it at a healthy level daily, month after month\u2026 year after year.\n\nSo in doing the research for myself and my family, I discovered 10 natural ingredients that can help support healthy blood pressure:\n\nLet\u2019s first start with the top 5 clinically proven herbal extracts.\n\nGrape Seed Extract \u2013 There is a patented form called MegaNatural-BP (US patent 6,544,581), which can help support healthy blood pressure in only 30 days.10\n\nEnglish Hawthorn Berry Extract \u2013 Supports healthy blood pressure, helps support strong contractile force in the heart, and improves cardiovascular health.11,12\n\nCelery Seed Extract \u2013 Works similar to calcium channel blocking drugs, but without the negative drug side effects. Has many vascular benefits.\n\nPomegranate Extract \u2013 A compound found only in pomegranates called punicalagin, has been shown to not only for blood pressure and increase the speed at which heart blockages caused by atherosclerosis are removed, it also helps with cholesterol.14\n\nLycopene Extract \u2013 This is a substance normally found in tomato seeds. Studies have shown it can help support healthy blood pressure as well as operate as an antioxidant, preventing damage done by free radicals, especially to arteries and blood vessels.15\n\nLet\u2019s not forget our vitamins and minerals. The top 5 most important ones are:\n\nMagnesium blend (Glycinate, Amino Acid Chelate, Albion\u00ae Di-Magnesium Malate, Magnesium Citrate) \u2013 There are many forms of magnesium and each has a different function, bioavailability and absorption factor. So, you can\u2019t just take any form of magnesium. The best blend is Glycinate, Amino Acid Chelate, Albion\u00ae Di-Magnesium Malate, Magnesium Citrate.\n\nPotassium is very important because it balances sodium, which causes water retention and raises blood pressure levels. It\u2019s a natural diuretic. Unfortunately, 95% of people are lacking in important minerals when compared to sodium levels.\n\nVitamin D3, B6, and C work together to improve stress hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone levels, both causing blood pressure problems.\n\nAnd finally, one of my favorite amino acids, L-Arginine. Which works by increasing Nitric Oxide levels, dilating blood vessels, and improving blood flow\u2026 resulting in healthy blood pressure.4,5\n\nHowever, keep in mind that you need high levels of regular L-Arginine and the \u201cAlpha-Ketoglutarate\u201d (AKG) version is much better absorbed and preferred.\n\nOnce my family, my patients, and I started using these specific ingredients at the correct dosages, we all got great results and no side effects.\n\nHowever, the big problem was that we were taking a bunch of pills and powders, 2-3x daily. It was just a big hassle.\n\nAnd this is why I\u2019m not expecting or advising you to go out and buy all of these ingredients individually and take them daily because it\u2019s just way too expensive and inconvenient.\n\nI know from personal experience because I tried it myself. It\u2019s not a realistic, long-term solution, and if you don\u2019t stick to something daily because you won\u2019t get lasting results.\n\nThe good news is that you can now get access to a simple, proven, and effective solution, which eliminates the need to take all of these ingredients by themselves.\n\nSo it\u2019s easy, you\u2019ll get fast results and it\u2019s what my family and I do myself.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nNwankwo T, Yoon SS, Burt V, Gu Q.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/real-causes-of-hypertension-best-natural-solutions/",
    "content": "A while back I did an article about the top 10 causes of blood pressure problems.\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to do a quick summary of what\u2019s called the \u201csilent killer\u201d because there are no real symptoms that let you know you have blood pressure problems.\n\nDizziness, headaches, rapid heartbeat, etc\u2026 are NOT specific to blood pressure.\n\nIn fact, 76% of people who have blood pressure problems, don\u2019t even know it.\n\nAnd, it can cause more serious heart problems, kidney failure, and renal issues.\n\nSo, you really need to control your blood pressure because not only does it help avoid health problems, but lower blood pressure is also correlated to a longer life.\n\nAnd since personally, I have a family history of blood pressure problems, I wanted to make sure that this aspect of my life for myself and more importantly, my parents \u2013 is under control and done so NATURALLY \u2014 without harmful drugs or negative side effects.\n\nI also decided to update this for 2025 so you can have all the recent information based on the newest research.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started.\n\n1 \u2013 AGE & High Blood Pressure\n\nBy far, the #1 cause of blood pressure problems is age and more specifically, the negative changes in your HORMONES due to aging.\n\nFrom the age of 18-39, about 3% of the population has some kind of blood pressure problem.\n\nHowever, between 40-59, it jumps to almost 35% and after the age of 60+, it\u2019s OVER 70% of people.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t worry\u2026 there are ways to improve this regardless of your age.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll show you how at the end of today\u2019s article and how my own parents have dealt with this \u2014 and my mom is 85 years old and my dad is 92.\n\n2 \u2013 Genetics + Family History & Blood Pressure\n\nYes, genetics is a major problem with everything. But there are ways to turn ON or OFF your genetics\u2026. as you\u2019ll see with the rest of this article.\n\n3 \u2013 Smoking & High Blood Pressure\n\nThis is well known for decades. It reduces blood flow, which increases blood pressure.\n\nIf you do smoke and don\u2019t want to stop, at least take specific vitamins that\u2019ll help promote healthy blood pressure levels.\n\n4 \u2013 Alcohol & High Blood Pressure\n\nDon\u2019t let the \u201cred wine is good for your heart\u201d media advertising to fool you because alcohol is a toxin and it causes hormonal imbalances, leading to blood pressure problems in the long run.\n\nAlcohol also stresses the liver and kidneys, which increases blood pressure.\n\nAlcohol reduces sleep quality, which then increases stress hormones such as cortisol, which then increases blood pressure.\n\nI know people like their alcohol, so I\u2019m not going to tell you to stop if you don\u2019t want to. But please take specific vitamins that\u2019ll help promote healthy blood pressure levels.\n\n5 \u2013 Being Overweight & High Blood Pressure\n\nBeing overweight puts a lot of pressure on your organs and heart. Even if you have 250 lbs of muscle \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of work on your body, which means higher blood pressure.\n\nHaving a lot more bodyfat, versus muscle is even worse.\n\nBeing overweight also increases blood sugar, which indirectly increases blood pressure.\n\nAnyway, do your best to lose some weight. I\u2019ve got lots of weight loss articles & videos for you to utilize.\n\nIn the meantime, please take specific vitamins that\u2019ll help promote healthy blood pressure levels.\n\n6 \u2013 Sodium/Salt & High Blood Pressure\n\nThis has to do with regular table salt and what\u2019s found in processed foods. But NOT with natural salts like Himalayan and Celtic.\n\nAlso, the salt is not the problem. It\u2019s the LACK OF WATER and hydration that\u2019s the issue.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nreduce salt, especially from packaged foods and eating out\n\nincrease your water intake to dilute the salt in your body\n\ntake specific vitamins that\u2019ll help promote healthy blood pressure levels.\n\n7 \u2013 Stress & High Blood Pressure\n\nStress is always bad, but it\u2019s HOW you manage the stress that IS the real problem.\n\nThe reason is that when the stress hormone cortisol goes up, your body retains water, and adrenalin increases \u2013 both of which speed up your heart and increase blood pressure.\n\nThere are lots of ways to reduce stress:\n\nArticles & videos about lowering stress\n\nMost powerful vitamins & herbs for lowering stress hormones\n\n8 \u2013 Physical Activity & High Blood Pressure\n\nWhen you don\u2019t move much + aging, increases blood pressure.\n\nThe very best and easiest thing to do is take daily walks. 30-45 minutes daily.\n\nYou can break it up to 10-15 min walks, 2-3x daily \u2013 that\u2019s what I do.\n\nFirst thing in the morning, at lunchtime and late evening.\n\n9 \u2013 Medical Conditions & High Blood Pressure\n\nCertain medical conditions will increase blood pressure. A few are:\n\ndecrease in hormones as we age (menopause for women, andropause for men)\n\nkidney and liver problems\n\nsleep problems (insomnia, sleep apnea, etc)\n\nSince it\u2019s hard to fix all of these issues and some you obviously can\u2019t, please take specific vitamins that\u2019ll help promote healthy blood pressure levels.\n\n10 \u2013 Prescription Drugs & High Blood Pressure\n\nIronically, many \u201cheart medications\u201d actually cause MORE harm in the long run.\n\nThey\u2019re good, temporarily for the first few weeks.\n\nBut your body adapts because these drugs are \u201cfake\u201d and cause more stress to your organs over time.\n\nThen you have to increase the dose to continue to get the benefits, which can lead to more negative side-effects.\n\nMake sure you make NATURAL improvements in your life, as listed above.\n\nAnd if you want faster and easier results, consider taking specific vitamins that\u2019ll help promote healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Now in 2025, most people have high blood pressure and don\u2019t even know it.\n\nThat\u2019s why high blood pressure is called the \u201csilent killer\u201d.\n\nEven when I consult athletes, a lot of them have high blood pressure even though they are very healthy.\n\nHigh blood pressure can cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\nHigh blood pressure is very bad for your kidneys.\n\nUnfortunately, as we age, our blood pressure will increase.\n\nSo, I suggest everyone take their blood pressure at home so you can make sure how healthy you are and if you need to make adjustments in your life style to help lower blood pressure.\n\nThe good news is that you can use an automated cuff at home, so it\u2019s easy and convenient.\n\nHowever, the one major problem is that most people make many mistakes when taking their blood pressure. This happens even at the doctor\u2019s office\n\nAnd yes, I made some of these mistakes myself.\n\nSo, let me quickly go over them so you can get the most accurate blood pressure readings.\n\nYou always want to put the cuff on your left arm. I\u2019ve had nurses do it on my right arm and that\u2019s incorrect.\n\nThe first thing you do NOT want to do is put the cuff over any clothing. It makes logical sense, yet many people do it since they might be in a hurry.\n\nSo, make sure it\u2019s against your skin.\n\nMake sure the tube is in the middle of your arm.\n\nThe bottom of the cuff should be about half an inch to an inch above the fold of your arm. You can use an index finger as a measuring tool.\n\nIf you wrap the cuff too loosely or too tight, you\u2019ll get incorrect measurements.\n\nYou should be able to stick one finger in between your arm and the cuff, with a slight wiggle.\n\nIf you can\u2019t stick one finger in, it\u2019s too tight. More than 2 fingers, it\u2019s too loose.\n\nMost people will measure with their arm down. This has happened to me at the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nYou want your arm at the level of your heart. So, it should be raised a little bit, so your bicep is horizontal with your heart.\n\nYou might want to put your arm on a table to keep it elevated.\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize that your leg position also affects your blood pressure readings.\n\nYou do not want to cross your legs or elevate them. Both feet need to be planted on the floor in a relaxed position.\n\nThis is a mistake I\u2019ve made in the past. I\u2019d be walking around the house or whatever. I\u2019d sit down and immediately take my blood pressure.\n\nBlood pressure readings need to be at rest.\n\nSo, don\u2019t do it after moving around or running. Make sure you\u2019re not stressed out. You didn\u2019t just eat a big meal. You\u2019re not talking.\n\nYou should be sitting for at least 5-10 minutes, at rest, before taking your blood pressure.\n\nThis is also why your blood pressure can be artificially higher at the doctor\u2019s office. Because of stress, or moving too much, and so forth.\n\nThis is called \u201cwhite coat syndrome\u201d and it\u2019s happened to me a few times.\n\nIf you have to urinate and you\u2019re holding in your pee, your blood pressure will be artificially elevated because it\u2019s under stress.\n\nSo, make sure you\u2019ve emptied your bladder before taking your blood pressure.\n\n9 \u2013 Stress & Stimulants\n\nKeep in mind that anything that\u2019s going to stress your body will increase your blood pressure.\n\nFor example \u2013 if you just got in an argument with someone, or you didn\u2019t sleep well the night before \u2013 your cortisol and adrenaline are high and that\u2019ll increase your blood pressure.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re taking stimulants \u2013 such as ADHD drugs or caffeine, you\u2019ll have higher blood pressure levels.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re always drinking coffee and take a lot of caffeine every day, then that is most likely your accurate blood pressure.\n\nWhich brings up the last point.\n\n10 \u2013 One Time Blood Pressure Reading\n\nAfter all is said and done, you do NOT want to judge your blood pressure reading or your health based on a ONE-time reading.\n\nWhat you want is an average of your blood pressure readings at different times of the day.\n\nBest Way To Measure Blood Pressure\n\nIf you go to the doctor, they made a few of these mistakes that I\u2019ve mentioned today and your blood pressure is high, they may prescribe you medication. You probably don\u2019t need it.\n\nDo all the things I mentioned. Rest for 10 minutes and do a test. Record it.\n\nThen wait another 10 minutes, and do another test. Record it.\n\nDo that in the morning and again in the evening.\n\nDo this over the course of a few days.\n\nIf you see large fluctuations, then you\u2019ll need to make improvements in your life and support healthy blood pressure naturally.\n\nWhat you care about are averages.\n\nBest Blood Pressure Machines\n\nIn regards to the blood pressure machine, get the one where the cuff goes around your arm and NOT the wrist monitors\n\nThe wrist monitor ones are NOT accurate. In fact, that\u2019s the one I first got and the numbers were always off. They were actually very low.\n\nI thought I was super healthy. My numbers were like 110/70 or sometimes lower.\n\nI then tested it with the arm cuff and the results were higher, but still in the normal range. Such as 120/80\n\nNow, if you can\u2019t do the arm one for whatever reason, then the wrist one is better than nothing. But, increase the numbers to be more accurate.\n\nAlso, even with the automated arm cuffs, I\u2019ve noticed the top Systolic number is usually higher than if you were to do it manually with a stethoscope. I say about 10 points higher on average for the top systolic number\n\nSo, 130/80 on the automated cuff, is probably 120/80 if you measured it manually.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll need someone else to do the manual method, which most people don\u2019t do these days.\n\nResearch has shown that 120/80 is good, but lower numbers such as 110/70 might be better.\n\nSupport Healthy Blood Pressure Naturally\n\nAgain, please visit the links on the best and easiest ways to support healthy blood pressure, naturally.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t want to change your lifestyle, you can take specific herbs and vitamins that\u2019ll quickly and conveniently promote healthy blood pressure levels within a normal range.\n\nThis is what I do for my parents, especially as they\u2019ve aged.\n\nRemember, aging alone will cause an increase in your blood pressure \u2013 so, it may not be your fault even with a healthy lifestyle\n\nHowever, it is your responsibility to support it naturally.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 now and in the past, I\u2019ve spoken about how bad high blood pressure is for your health. Of course, it can lead to serious health problems.\n\nHowever, high blood pressure also accelerates aging, decreases blood flow, and causes wrinkles, hair loss, memory problems, and erectile problems\u2026 just to name a few.\n\nAnd the older you get, the higher your blood pressure gets due to the negative changes in hormones.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that 67% of adults have pre-hypertension. This means their blood pressure is above normal and borderline high.\n\nThus, it\u2019s just a matter of time before you\u2019re diagnosed with high blood pressure and your doctor is going to do what they do best \u2013 prescribe you a toxic and addictive drug, which has even MORE negative effects than the original problem of having high blood pressure.\n\nAnd I know this situation very well because both of my parents have had problems with blood pressure in the past.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to share with you a yummy food you can eat daily, which clinical studies have shown can support healthy blood pressure \u2013 without any negative effects.\n\nLower Your Blood Pressure With Blueberries\n\nResearchers have discovered that anthocyanins, a type of compound found in blueberries, can improve endothelial function, resulting in lower blood pressure.\n\nThis has also been confirmed by four additional human studies, in addition to animal studies as well.\n\nTo try to duplicate the results of this study, you\u2019d have to eat about 100 grams of blueberries twice a day, which equates to about two total cups of blueberries.\n\nHowever, a few things to consider:\n\nMake sure this is done twice daily. 200 grams in one sitting, didn\u2019t perform as well as 100 grams, twice daily.\n\nYou should eat organic blueberries. Because of the thin skin of blueberries, pesticides, and similar toxins can easily get through the thin skin and go directly into the blueberry. Unlike, for example, a pineapple \u2013 which has a thick outer protective layer, which you don\u2019t eat anyway.\n\nDon\u2019t drink blueberry juice, it needs to be the actual fruit. Besides, drinking the juice will increase your blood sugar, which will actually increase your blood pressure \u2013 the opposite of your goal.\n\nI actually buy frozen, organic blueberries because it\u2019s hard to find fresh blueberries in season, year-round.\n\nThe smaller, \u201cwild\u201d blueberries have even more benefits.\n\nIn fact, English Hawthorn Berries have way more benefits than blueberries. But, they\u2019re hard to find and very expensive.\n\nThe only problem with all of this is that I know people and most will not do this, twice daily, year-round. It\u2019s not convenient and it can for sure get expensive, especially in the offseason.\n\nThus, I suggest an easier solution that\u2019s way more convenient, costs less, has no calories, and actually works much better. It\u2019s a formula that my family and I have been using for years.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nThe Journal of Gerontology: Series A\n\n\u201cCirculating anthocyanin metabolites mediate vascular benefits of blueberries: insights from randomized controlled trials, metabolomics, and nutrigenomics.\u201d The Journals of Gerontology, 16 February 2019.",

    "content": "It\u2019s In 2025 and unhealthy blood pressure levels continues to be a major problem, affecting over 70% of adults. It\u2019s called the \u201csilent killer\u201d because most people don\u2019t know they have high blood pressure\u2026 as you\u2019ll find out more below.\n\nToday\u2019s question is from Rose and she asks:\n\n\u201cHow do you I know if I have blood pressure problems?\u2026 I think lately I\u2019ve had it because I\u2019ve been having headaches. How can I have healthy BP naturally?\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s the truth \u2014 unless you take your blood pressure readings multiple times a day for a few days in a row, it\u2019s almost IMPOSSIBLE to know if you have chronic blood pressure problems.\n\nThis is because there is NO list of symptoms or \u201csigns\u201d of blood pressure problems\u2026. And THIS is the scary part!\n\nIt\u2019s a MYTH that people with blood pressure problems will experience symptoms, like nervousness, sweating, headaches, nosebleeds or facial flushing.\n\nThe scary fact is that the blood pressure problem is a symptomless \u201csilent killer.\u201d\n\nIf you ignore your blood pressure because you think a certain symptom or sign will alert you to the problem, you are taking a dangerous chance with your life.\n\nThis is a VERY important topic for me because I have a family history of blood pressure problems.\n\nWhat really scared me personally at an early age is that my grandfather died immediately with his FIRST and ONLY stroke.\n\nMy uncle was handicapped and paralyzed for the rest of his life, with his FIRST and ONLY stroke.\n\nThus \u2013 NO warnings. NO second chances. NO opportunity to make changes or improvements.\n\nAnd this is why the blood pressure problem is known as the \u201csilent killer\u201d. Unfortunately, issues with blood pressure have become a \u201csilent\u201d epidemic.\n\nDid you know that: 1/3 (35%) of adults over the age of 20 have blood pressure problems?\u2026\n\n1/2 (50%) over the age of 40\n\nAlmost 3/4 (75%) over the age of 55\n\nYet, 72% aren\u2019t even aware that they have it.\n\nIf you\u2019re over the age of 50, a man or woman\u2026 chances are you have blood pressure problems!\n\nAbout 84% of people having strokes have blood pressure problems.\n\nThe fact is that blood pressure problem is a major cause of heart failure!\n\nEven Worse Than Cholesterol!\n\nAnd in my opinion, more important than cholesterol levels.\n\nThis is why blood pressure drugs are the #2 most prescribed1 drugs in America.\n\nAnd get this, there 11 different TYPES2 of \u201cblood pressure\u201d drugs.\n\nAnd a total of over 75 different medications!\n\nAnd YET \u2013 this problem is getting worse each and every year mainly because the drugs just aren\u2019t working.\n\nAnyway, I mention all of this not to be a \u201cdowner\u201d or to \u201cruin your day\u201d.\n\nBut to emphasize the importance of making sure you have healthy blood pressure levels and not look for symptoms because there aren\u2019t any reliable ones.\n\nBecause the statistics show that most of us have elevated blood pressure. So you and I need to make improvements in our lifestyle.\n\nPLEASE \u2013 Don\u2019t Be Another \u201cStatistic\u201d\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t want you to be another statistic, like my own grandfather, uncle, and even my dad.\n\nForget about taking drugs \u2013 they don\u2019t always work and it\u2019s not a good or safe long-term solution because they have lots of negative side effects.\n\nIt\u2019s always best to FIRST try to promote healthy blood pressure levels, naturally.\n\nThen, if that doesn\u2019t work (diet, exercise, vitamins, etc.) \u2013 you can add in small amounts of blood pressure medications.\n\nNatural options exist\u2026 it\u2019s what I personally use for myself, as well as my family.\n\nSo please don\u2019t feel \u201chopeless\u201d. Simple, effective, proven, and safe options DO exist!\u2026\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/news/20110420/the-10-most-prescribed-drugs\n\nhttp://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/PreventionTreatmentofHighBloodPressure/Types-of-Blood-Pressure-Medications_UCM_303247_Article.jsp",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and most people, especially doctors\u2026 still try to get healthy blood pressure by using harmful prescription drugs.\n\nBut as you may already know, these medications are just loaded with lots of negative side effects.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate because proven natural alternative options exist, which I\u2019ll share with you in a little bit. These natural options are safer than blood pressure medications.\n\nHowever, what you (and your doctor) should really be doing is trying to control, reduce and potentially eliminate the CAUSES of blood pressure problems\u2026\n\nSo in today\u2019s article, you\u2019ll discover the top 10 causes of blood pressure problems and at the end, I\u2019ll give you my favorite natural solution that my family and I personally use\u2026\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize that AGE is one of the BIGGEST factors for blood pressure problems.\n\nIn fact, after the age of 40, 33% of the population has blood pressure problems. And over the age of 60, it\u2019s 65%.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re over the age of 40 and have a blood pressure problem, it may not be your fault.\n\nHowever, it IS your responsibility to fix it right away and take action using today\u2019s simple solutions.\n\n2. Genetics & Family History\n\nWell, not much can be done here. This is in fact my own problem because I have a family history (on my dad\u2019s side) of blood pressure problems\n\nBut again, what\u2019s important to know is that IF you do have a family history, you MUST take action today to help avoid any future complications.\n\nYou already know that smoking has NO health benefits and it\u2019s a major cause of blood pressure problems, so you have to stop!\n\nA little bit of alcohol is okay, especially if it\u2019s organic red wine.\n\nBut drinking every night will cause damage to your heart, arteries, and liver over time.\n\nAlcohol is a toxin and it\u2019s acidic, both being bad for your body, aging, and your organs.\n\nSimilar to smoking, being overweight has no health benefits.\n\nAnd the older you get, the harder it is to lose that unwanted fat.\n\nI know losing fat is hard. But, try to walk more daily. Reduce calories from sauces and drinks, since those are super dense and high calories. It\u2019s a start\u2026\n\nSalt has its benefits actually.\n\nHowever, regular table salt or salt found in processed foods and packages is BAD for you. There\u2019s also a lot of it in packaged foods.\n\nHowever, \u201cnatural\u201d salts such as Himalayan rock or Celtic sea salt are GOOD for you when used in moderation and can actually help support healthy blood pressure and stress hormones.\n\nIt is well-known stress is bad.\n\nHowever, you can\u2019t get rid of it but we can MANAGE it better.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is the MEANING you give to stressful situations.\n\nIf you freak out, get negative and focus on the problem the entire time \u2026 you put your body under extra stress.\n\nThe secret is to focus on the SOLUTION and to know that \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d and worrying about the problem isn\u2019t going to help anything\u2026 Especially your blood pressure or heart.\n\n8. Lack Of Physical Activity\n\nWe sit too much these days.\n\nJust get outside and walk daily, even if it\u2019s just for 15-20 minutes. Best times are first thing in the morning and after meals.\n\nIt\u2019ll do wonders for your physical AND mental health!\n\n9. Medical Conditions\n\nThis goes back to \u201cgenetics\u201d.\n\nAnd if you know you have a genetic \u201cproblem\u201d or a family history, that is making things worse, then you MUST make changes to your lifestyle right away because your body is more sensitive than the average person.\n\nIronically, many \u201cheart\u201d medications actually cause more heart PROBLEMS in the long run.\n\nThey can increase your cholesterol, blood sugar, or blood pressure levels.\n\nThey can decrease blood flow and circulation. And they all cause extra stress on your liver and kidneys, which then cause more problems for your heart.\n\nOf course, you should always speak to your doctor about ALL of your options.\n\nHowever, nature already has the answers, NOT the pharmaceutical companies!\n\nWhenever possible, take FEWER drugs and utilize natural solutions.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "High blood pressure is still a major problem in 2025\n\nIn fact, I received an email a week ago from Tammy and she said:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done everything to support healthy blood pressure and nothing has really worked. I\u2019ve listened to my doctor, I\u2019ve changed my diet and I\u2019ve removed all the salt and still, there\u2019s barely any improvement! What can I do because I don\u2019t want to deal with the negative side effects of drugs.\u201d\n\nWell, the REAL cause of blood pressure problems has more to do with aging and the negative changes in your hormones \u2026\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you more about this in a minute and how you can fix it, as I\u2019ve done with my own father.\n\nHowever, in regards to salt and blood pressure, that\u2019s a myth!\n\nThe internet is full of misinformation and confusion. My goal with this article is to help give you clarity and eliminate the frustration when it comes to your health.\n\nSalt Is Essential For Life\n\nSo here\u2019s the reality check based on facts and clinical studies \u2013 not what the so-called \u201cexperts\u201d or \u201cwebsites\u201d said.\n\nHigh-quality salt is essential for life.\n\nMost of the planet is made of saltwater. Your body is made up of saltwater.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the hospital, they give you a \u201csaline drip\u201d, which is made up of salt water.\n\nSo logically it makes sense that salt is important and needed.\n\nAs far as clinical evidence, in one study of over 6250 people, cutting salt intake did NOT reduce the risk for heart problems.1\n\nAnother study in 2013, showed that lower salt consumption actually INCREASED your risk of heart problems.2\n\nA review of the available research reveals that much of the science behind the supposed link between \u201csalt and blood pressure\u201d is dubious and doubtful at best. According to Scientific American:3\n\n\u201cIntersalt, a large study published in 19884, compared sodium intake with blood pressure in subjects from 52 international research centers and found NO relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure problems.\n\nIn fact, the population that ate the most salt, about 14 grams a day, had a lower median blood pressure than the population that ate the least, about 7.2 grams a day\u2026\n\nFor every study that suggests that salt is unhealthy, multiple ones reveal that it does not.\u201d\n\nSo what about the studies that show lowering salt is good for blood pressure?\n\nA 2004 analysis of 11 salt-reduction trials found that over the long-term, low-salt diets decreased systolic blood pressure by 1.1 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure by 0.6 mmHg. That equates to reducing your blood pressure from 120/80 to 119/79.6\n\nThat\u2019s NOTHING! That doesn\u2019t even count!\n\nA 2006 study in the American Journal of Medicine study compared the reported daily sodium intakes of 78 million Americans to their risk of dying from heart disease over the course of 14 years.\n\nThe study concluded that lower sodium diets led to HIGHER death rates among those with cardiovascular disease!7\n\nI can go on and on, but I hope you see where this is leading.\n\nSalt is good for you. However\u2026\n\nNot ALL Salt Is Created Equal\n\nNot only is salt relatively benign, but it\u2019s also actually a nutritional goldmine,\u2026 IF you consume the right kind.\n\nModern table salt has very little in common with natural, unrefined salt.\n\nRegular table salt can damage your health, while natural salts can be healing.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick break-down of their basic ingredients:\n\nNatural salt: 84 percent sodium chloride, 16 percent naturally occurring trace minerals, including silicon, phosphorous, vanadium, magnesium, potassium, etc.\n\nProcessed (table) salt: 97.5 percent sodium chloride, 2.5 percent man-made chemicals, such as moisture absorbents and flow agents. These are dangerous chemicals.\n\nProcessing table salt also radically alters and damages the structure of the salt.\n\nRefined table salt is dried above 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, and this excessive heat alters the natural chemical structure of the salt, making it toxic.8\n\nOne last thing processed \u201cwhite\u201d table salt causes water retention and bloating.\n\nEspecially with all the sodium in pre-packaged foods. This causes headaches and makes you look \u201cpuffy\u201d.\n\nWhile natural salts, containing minerals and electrolytes, are vital for water balance, enzyme production, stress reduction, a healthy immune system, adrenal and thyroid function.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Salt?\n\nAs stated, you want to avoid processed salts \u2013 which include the typical table salts, as well as those found in packaged foods and drinks.\n\nAlso, avoid the white \u201csea salts\u201d because those are heavily processed as well.\n\nYou want to use unrefined natural salts, such as Himalayan Salt or Celtic Sea Salt.\n\nCeltic salt is slightly better because it has a little less sodium and more magnesium.\n\nHowever, what matters most between the two is how they taste for YOU!\n\nImportance Of Potassium\n\nOne last thing \u2013 higher salt intake needs to be balanced with the opposing mineral Potassium. So, you might consider adding 1 or 2 potassium supplements daily.\n\nThey are inexpensive. Usually 99 mg pills.\n\nPlease speak with your doctor if you\u2019re on potassium-sparing or blood pressure medications.\n\nWhen it comes to salt \u2013 go ahead and add some to your foods for a little bit of taste and a lot of extra health. Just AVOID the refined, processed \u201cwhite\u201d salt and stick to natural Himalayan or Celtic salts.\n\nEven though today\u2019s topic was about salt, the original message is that you must have healthy blood pressure.\n\nIt should be 120/80 or lower for optimal health and the avoidance of a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThis is such an important topic to me, because we have a family history of blood pressure problems.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21731062\n\nhttp://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/899663\n\nhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt\n\nhttp://www.ajcn.org/content/65/2/626S.abstract\n\nhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt\n\nhttp://summaries.cochrane.org/CD003656/the-long-term-effects-of-advice-to-cut-down-on-salt-in-food-on-deaths-cardiovascular-disease-and-blood-pressure-in-adults\n\nhttp://summaries.cochrane.org/CD003656/the-long-term-effects-of-advice-to-cut-down-on-salt-in-food-on-deaths-cardiovascular-disease-and-blood-pressure-in-adults\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16490476",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/5-surprising-blood-pressure-facts-everyone-should-know/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and by now, most people know that having blood pressure problems isn\u2019t good and they should have it checked regularly, especially if they have a family history of heart problems (heart attacks, strokes, etc.).\n\nAnd I bring this up because this is something my family and I have to deal with.\n\nHowever, beyond the basics, there\u2019s a lot of incorrect information about the causes of blood pressure problems, including mistakes your own doctor makes.\n\nSo today I\u2019ll quickly share 5 of these surprising blood pressure facts with you.\n\n1 \u2014 Too LITTLE salt can cause blood pressure problems\n\nMost people know that too much salt is bad, but too little can cause problems as well \u2014 especially if you have congestive heart failure.\n\nYour body is made up of saltwater (saline) and so is most of the planet.\n\nThus, salt is natural and has many benefits. It helps regulate many functions in your body, especially with your muscles (your heart being one of them).\n\nFor some people, restricting your salt intake to less than 2000 mg daily can raise your blood pressure.\n\nWhat you want to do is eliminate or reduce the white table salt and hidden salts found in snack and processed foods, soups, pickles, etc.\n\nIf you want to have salt, have natural salts such as Celtic and Himalayan because they contain minerals that help balance the sodium (magnesium, calcium potassium, etc.).\n\n2 \u2014 Potassium balances sodium\n\nSpeaking of minerals, eating foods high in potassium is good because it balances your sodium intake.\n\nPotassium also helps relax your arterial walls and keeps blood pressure in a healthy range.\n\nFoods such as baked potatoes, coconut water, bananas, squash, and eggplants are high in potassium.\n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t like eating these foods, simply taking potassium pills will help \u2013 it\u2019s easy and convenient.\n\n3 \u2014 Many doctors and nurses take inaccurate blood pressure measurements\n\nI remember once a nurse took my blood pressure reading while she was talking to me and I was speaking back to her. My blood pressure reading was still healthy, but NOT accurate.\n\nWhen taking your blood pressure, you should be relaxed and not talking. Sit up straight in the chair with back support. With both your feet planted on the floor.\n\nAdditionally, your blood pressure can vary from your right or left arm. So it\u2019s best to test both arms for an accurate reading.\n\n4 \u2014 Low blood pressure isn\u2019t a problem unless you have symptoms\n\nUnless you\u2019re experiencing lightheartedness, dizziness or fatigue, having low blood pressure is fine.\n\nHowever, having blood pressure problems without symptoms is NOT fine!\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s called the \u201csilent killer\u201d because many times you don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything negative, but there\u2019s a lot of strain on your body.\n\n5 \u2014 Exercise can increase your blood pressure\n\nExercise is great and for most of us it helps regulate and normalize our blood pressure. It\u2019s a great stress reliever.\n\nHowever, if you just jump right into your workout without some warming up, your blood pressure may shoot up.\n\nOr lifting heavy weights, pushing, and straining, can also cause a spike in your blood pressure.\n\nYou should always be doing a combination of cardio and weights for total health. Just make sure you warm up and also cool down at the end of your workout.\n\nHaving healthy blood pressure is VERY important for your health and longevity, as well as energy levels and the avoidance of heart problems.\n\nHowever, keep the following in mind.\n\nAvoid white table salt and hidden salts in pre-packaged foods. Instead, use Celtic and Himalayan salts because they contain minerals to balance the sodium.\n\nAdd in some potassium-rich foods or supplements to balance your sodium and relax your arterial walls.\n\nMake sure you take accurate blood pressure readings.\n\nLow blood pressure without symptoms is fine, but NOT blood pressure without symptoms.\n\nMake sure to warm up and cool down with your workouts to prevent blood pressure spikes.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/5-easy-ways-to-increase-low-blood-pressure-hypotension/",
    "content": "I normally get asked how to DECREASE blood pressure.\n\nThis is very important because one of the top reasons for blood pressure problems is just aging and the negative changes in your hormones. Thus, whether you like it or not, your blood pressure goes up the older you get.\n\nHowever, today\u2019s topic is how to increase and raise LOW blood pressure and thus, if you have HYPO-tension.\n\nAnd I\u2019m only doing this topic because I\u2019ve been asked a few times by people who are hypotensive and want to know what to do.\n\nPersonally, the lower your blood pressure, the better. You\u2019ll live longer. Your heart will be healthier, as will your brain.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t having any negative health issues, then don\u2019t worry about it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having low blood pressure if you feel fine.\n\nHowever, if you are having symptoms of low blood pressure, such as\n\nRapid, shallow breathing\n\nThen it\u2019s time to take action and raise your blood pressure to a more normal range, which would be around 120/80.\n\nSo, here are 5 simple ways to quickly raise low blood pressure.\n\nBeing dehydrated, which most people are, can lead to either lower or higher blood pressure. In today\u2019s case, I suggest you drink more water. I would add in a little bit of lemon juice and Himalayan or Celtic salt into the water for better absorption and prevent you from peeing all day long.\n\nSpeaking of adding salt to your water, you should also add it to your foods. Start low and build up depending on how you feel. The most important time of the day to have more salt is in the morning and also before and after exercise.\n\nSalt regulates aldosterone levels and other hormones, which will help balance your blood pressure.\n\n3 \u2013 Limit or Avoid Alcohol\n\nAlcohol causes dehydration, which can lower blood pressure. So, either avoid or limit your alcohol intake. Or at least, make sure you increase your saltwater intake to make up for the dehydration. Just drink a couple of extra glasses of water after your alcohol consumption.\n\n4 \u2013 Eat Smaller Meals\n\nYou should eat smaller, frequent meals. This is because having one or two big meals, causes a huge rush of blood to go to the digestive tract which then lowers your blood pressure. In healthy people, your body compensates by increasing your heart rate to normalize blood pressure.\n\nHowever, maybe for you, this isn\u2019t the case, so it\u2019s better to eat smaller meals.\n\n5 \u2013 Normalize Your Blood Sugar\n\nBlood sugar affects blood pressure. In fact, having bad blood sugar levels is one of the causing factors of bad blood pressure. On the other hand, having low blood sugar can lower blood pressure.\n\nSo your goal is to keep your blood sugar levels steady \u2014 not high or low.\n\nEating smaller, frequent meals helps.\n\nHaving some fiber and fat with each meal also prevents blood sugar spikes.\n\nHaving more natural carbs such as vegetables, fruits, yams, legumes, and so forth is also better.\n\nThus, avoiding sugars, juices, sodas, processed carbs, and so forth.\n\nAgain, if you feel fine, then don\u2019t worry about having low blood pressure.\n\nBut if you are having weakness and other symptoms I mentioned earlier, then make sure you\n\nadd extra salt to your diet\n\ndon\u2019t have huge meals\n\nand make sure you have healthy blood sugar levels\n\nAnd if you know anyone who needs to support healthy blood pressure, which is a major cause of heart problems, click on the link so you can see how to do it naturally.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "As I\u2019ve stated before, nature already has most of the solutions to health problems, NOT pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAnd if you want healthy blood pressure, there are 3 juices that can help.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what you\u2019ll discover today.\n\nI really like pomegranates, they taste great and have a lot of benefits due to their antioxidants.\n\nI personally like the whole fruit, but it is messy to eat since you have to pick apart each of the little individual pomegranate seeds. So, you better not be wearing anything white, because the stuff does stain.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019d like to bypass it all, having 1 cup of pomegranate juice daily for 28 days (4 weeks) can support healthy blood pressure. A study reveals \u201ca significant fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as mean arterial pressure.\u201d1\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t want to deal with the sugar and calories, you can just take Pomegranate Extract (5:1 ratio) in a natural, supplement form.\n\nWatermelon contains an amino acid called citrulline (similar to arginine), which helps the body to produce nitric oxide, a gas that relaxes blood vessels and encourages flexibility in arteries. These effects aid the flow of blood, which can support healthy blood pressure.2\n\nAn increase in nitric oxide can also help improve erection strength, the short term.\n\nYou\u2019ll need about 2 cups of watermelons or 1 cup of the juice, 2-3x daily, to get these positive effects.\n\nDrinking 1 cup of beet juice daily for 28 days (4 weeks) can help support healthy blood pressure in the short and long term.3 Researchers believe that the beet\u2019s high levels of inorganic nitrates cause the reduction of blood pressure.\n\nOne thing I\u2019d like to pre-warn you about \u2014 don\u2019t be alarmed if your urine is pinkish or light red in color \u2013 beets will do that.\n\nI have a \u201cbonus\u201d fruit juice that also helps support healthy blood pressure and that\u2019s Hawthorn Berries. I call this a \u201cbonus\u201d juice because finding actual Hawthorn berries is a bit of a challenge.\n\nHowever, the actual juice is really difficult to find, which is unfortunate because it\u2019s really powerful at supporting healthy blood pressure.\n\nThis is because Hawthorn Berries contain antioxidant flavonoids, such as vitexin, which are used to:\n\nsupport healthy blood pressure\n\nrelieve angina (chest pain caused by reduced blood flow)\n\nimprove heart pump efficiency\n\nreduce abnormal heart rhythms\n\nreduce stress-related blood pressure problems\n\nHawthorn is believed to support healthy blood pressure by relaxing peripheral blood vessels and dilating arteries in the same way as ACE inhibitor antihypertensive drugs \u2013 by blocking the action of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme).\n\nHawthorn may also increase levels of nitric oxide (a powerful blood vessel dilator). And it also has a mild diuretic action, which decreases fluid retention and helps support healthy blood pressure.\n\nIts antioxidant action may also reduce the hardening of the arteries.\n\nAs you can see, it has lots of heart-healthy benefits, in addition to supporting healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nUnfortunately, the main problem is that it\u2019s really difficult to get Hawthorn berries. However, using Hawthorn berry extract in a supplement form is just as effective, much easier, and cheaper to use.\n\nPlus, it has no sugar or calories.\n\nNO Sugar & NO Calorie Option\n\nNOTE: I would like to conclude by saying that I\u2019m not a fan of drinking fruit juice. Even if it is natural, that\u2019s not how it\u2019s found in nature. It has too many calories and sugars. Whole fruit is much better than drinking only juice.\n\nUnfortunately, you\u2019ll have to eat a lot more fruit, to get the same benefits in concentrated fruit juice.\n\nHowever, you can take natural supplement extracts of different fruits and vegetables, which all can support healthy blood pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot easy, more convenient, and cheaper. Plus, no sugar or calories.\n\nIn the following link, you can see a list of the most effective natural vitamins, minerals, herbal, and fruit extracts.\n\nSo please take a look right now, below, while it\u2019s fresh on your mind.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22648092\n\nhttps://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q4/watermelon-shown-to-boost-heart-health,-control-weight-gain-in-mice.html\n\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/65/2/320",

That\u2019s when I realized it had been over 3 months since I had taken this natural supplement.\n\nSo, I immediately started taking herbs and vitamins again and by the end of the first week, my blood pressure was down to around 120/80\n\nI\u2019ve had numerous readings in the 110/70 range over the past month.\n\nHere\u2019s a link where you get more details about the natural supplement I take, how it works, the ingredients, and so forth.\n\nSo if you\u2019re concerned about blood pressure problems, the first thing to do is just drink more water.

It\u2019s something you\u2019ve probably eaten many times and it\u2019s celery.\n\nCelery contains a phytochemical called phthalides (tha-lates). It relaxes the tissues of the artery walls to increase blood flow and reduce blood pressure.\n\nThe lowest dose for positive results is at least 4 large stalks, daily. Some need double the amount of at least 2 cups daily.\n\nYou can also juice it since it has no sugar.\n\nThe good thing about celery is that it has almost no calories, so you don\u2019t have to worry about gaining weight.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re not going to do this daily, which most people won\u2019t\u2026 because it can get expensive and time-consuming\u2026 Then you can try it in herbal form as Celery Seed Extract.\n\nThe correct extract form contains a special compound called 3nB (L-3-n-butylphthalide).\n\nThis key extract has been shown in human clinical studies to promote healthier pressure levels within a normal, youthful range in 4-6 weeks, at a dose of 150 mg daily.\n\nTo obtain an equivalent amount of 3nB, one would have to consume approximately 530 stalks (nearly 50 pounds) of celery every single day.\n\nThis is why the celery seed extract is so much more potent and effective.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re really serious about having healthier blood pressure levels quickly and naturally, you should take Celery Seed Extract with other clinically proven ingredients, such as:\n\nMega Natural\u2019s Grape Seed Extract\n\nHawthorn Berry Extract\n\nAnd a few other essential vitamins and minerals\n\nThe best option is the most potent all-in-one solution that my family and use.\n\nSo, take a look right now while it\u2019s fresh on your mind, and make sure you do something today, to naturally improve your blood pressure, so you can live a longer, healthier and happier life!\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Pomegranate supports healthy blood pressure by reducing levels of Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a protein that plays an important role in controlling blood pressure by controlling the size of blood vessels in the body.\n\nAdditionally, a compound found only in pomegranates is called punicalagin. It has been shown to offer benefits for the heart and blood vessels, which will indirectly help support healthy blood pressure.\n\nDoes Pomegranate JUICE Work The Same?\n\nAs far as pomegranate JUICE, there are conflicting reports as to if it works, how long it works, etc.\n\nSimply stated, if it does work, it\u2019s short-term.\n\nAnd one main reason I believe is that you do NOT want to drink your calories. A cup of juice is all sugar.\n\nJuice and all that sugar increase your blood sugar levels, which then increases your blood pressure levels.\n\nNot to mention, one cup of juice has almost 150 calories. That\u2019s an extra 4500 calories a month. That means at least one pound of FAT gain.\n\nHowever, pomegranates do have benefits, if you do one of these two options.\n\nOPTION #1: Eat the actual pomegranates in fruit form, including the seeds, which have many benefits as well. The problem here is that it\u2019s messy and can get expensive if you buy pre-packaged and pre-seeded ones.\n\nOPTION #2: Take pomegranate EXTRACT in a pill form. A dose of 200 mg daily, especially when combined with other ingredients, has scientific proof for promoting healthier blood pressure levels within a normal, youthful range.\n\nThis is what my parents and I ended up doing because it\u2019s easier, convenient, and much less expensive than eating the actual fruit every day.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re really serious about having healthy blood pressure levels quickly and naturally, you should take Pomegranate Extract with other clinically proven ingredients, such as:\n\nMega Natural\u2019s Grape Seed Extract\n\nHawthorn Berry Extract\n\nAnd a few other essential vitamins and minerals\n\nThe best option is the most potent all-in-one solution that my family and use.\n\nSo, take a look right now while it\u2019s fresh on your mind, and make sure you do something today, to naturally support healthy blood pressure, so you can live a longer, healthier, and happier life!\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/can-drinking-water-lower-blood-pressure/",
    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from our YouTube comments section and Gean asks:\n\n\u201cDr. Robbins, I don\u2019t like the taste of water. I never have. Unfortunately, over the past few years, my blood pressure keeps going higher and higher. I now need to take medicine and I hate how it makes me feel.\n\nI\u2019ve read that being dehydrated is bad for the heart, muscles and blood pressure. But can I drink any type of liquid to get more hydrated or does it have to be water?\u201d\n\nThis is a good question and one that I related to because my mom also hates the taste of water.\n\nLuckily, I love water and always have. I\u2019m drinking it all day long.\n\nFacts About High Blood Pressure\n\nIn regards to high blood pressure \u2013 it is interesting that the older you get, the higher the blood pressure. So, there\u2019s something related to aging and the negative changes in your hormones and a weaker kidney function, that causes an increase in blood pressure.\n\nI\u2019ve seen older people who walk daily, are very thin, sleep well, and eat a healthy diet and yet \u2013 they have high blood pressure.\n\nAmazingly, there are over a dozen types of blood pressure drugs, all of which can cause some big negative side effects.\n\nHere are some really interesting facts:\n\n1 in 3 adults actually has hypertension. That\u2019s 33% of people. Of the remaining 67% of people, about half have pre-hypertension.\n\nSo, about 70% of adults have some kind of blood pressure issues and they are not in a lower, healthy range.\n\nNow, what\u2019s also interesting is that about 75% of adults are dehydrated.\n\nAnd, about 73% of the heart is made up of water!\n\nPersonally, I think that\u2019s really interesting\u2026 maybe you do as well.\n\nUnfortunately, most people don\u2019t know they have blood pressure problems because there are no real symptoms. This is why it\u2019s called \u201cthe silent killer\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, no liquid will do the job of clean water. Soda obviously won\u2019t, not diet soda either. Juice or milk, no way. Alcohol, never. Coffee can cause dehydration due to caffeine. Tea can be okay, as long as it\u2019s low in caffeine.\n\nAnyway, the answer to your question is that you DO need to increase your water intake because it can certainly help improve your blood pressure.\n\nAnd this is because when you\u2019re dehydrated, your muscles have to work harder \u2013 including your heart. The blood is thicker and has lower volume and all of this increases pressure and stress.\n\nHow Much Water Should You Drink?\n\nWell, thirst isn\u2019t a good indicator. Heck, hunger and fatigue are both signs of dehydration.\n\nHonestly, I think the minimum is 8 glasses of water. That\u2019s at least 64 oz or almost 2 liters or about half a gallon.\n\nI have double this amount, about a gallon a day.\n\nIf you do have other liquids, such as soda or caffeine products or alcohol, you\u2019ll need more water.\n\nIf you have more stress, exercise, sweat, etc\u2026 you\u2019ll need more water.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the taste of water, add in some lemon juice or stevia sweetener and it tastes like lemonade. It\u2019s great. That\u2019s what I do.\n\nThere are simple and natural ways, including the best vitamins and minerals that also help make big improvements in your blood pressure.\n\nJust know that high blood pressure negatively affects all your organs, your brain, eyes, energy levels, libido, and hair loss and accelerates aging.\n\nAnd the older you get, the worst the blood pressure.\n\nSo, please don\u2019t be like other people who just passively listen. Take action right now, increase your water intake even if it\u2019s just one cup a day.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK555956/",

When you have blood pressure problems, the blood flows through these blood vessels with a lot of extra force.\n\nThis is stressful to the kidneys. It can harm these blood vessels and cause kidney disease.\n\nHowever, blood pressure problems can also be a symptom of kidney disease. Kidneys help your body keep healthy blood pressure. When blood pressure damages your kidneys, they cannot control your blood pressure very well.\n\nSimple Ways To Support Healthy Blood Pressure And Improve Kidney Health\n\nLose weight. The heavier you are, especially excess body fat, the higher your blood pressure.\n\nWalk 20-30 minutes daily.\n\nTake specific vitamins, minerals, and herbs for fast results.\n\nDon\u2019t just passively listen like most people, actively take action.

    "content": "\"YES! - I Want Healthy Blood Pressure\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb Today\u2019s question is from James W and he asks, \u201cI\u2019m tired of taking prescription drugs and the negative side effects\u2026 Are there any foods that can support healthy blood pressure, naturally?\u201d.\n\nThis is a great question and one that I\u2019ve had to deal with personally because of my family history of blood pressure problems.\n\nUnfortunately, most foods don\u2019t work in the real world for healthy blood pressure because it\u2019s just too restrictive for most people.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there are about 8 specific foods that are scientifically researched to work\u2026 IF you take the right kind and the correct amounts.\n\nWhich is what I\u2019ll reveal today\u2026\n\nPlus at the end of today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll give you some simple shortcuts as well, for faster results with less effort.\n\nGarlic has many health benefits, especially for your heart and one of them is supporting healthy blood pressure.\n\nHowever, for it to really work you need to consume at least 3, RAW cloves of garlic daily. Unfortunately, the problem here is that your breath and body is going to smell.\n\nI tried everything with my parents, including taking herbal garlic supplements \u2014 same problem.\n\nAnd if the garlic supplement says \u201codorless\u201d, then it doesn\u2019t work because the key extracts such as \u201callicin\u201d is removed.\n\nSo Garlic is great, but not if you want a social life.\n\nTree Nuts \u2013 Cashews and Almonds\n\nTree nuts, and NOT peanuts, which come from the ground \u2014 are linked with many metabolic health benefits.\n\nAlmonds and cashews really stand out, particularly when it comes to metabolic problems such as blood pressure.\n\nThis is because they contain high levels of magnesium, a mineral that most of us are deficient in. And a lack of magnesium is strongly linked to blood pressure problems.\n\nJust make sure that these nuts are eaten RAW \u2014 not \u201croasted\u201d, which negatively changes the fat structure.\n\nOf course, not salted either is preferred.\n\nAnd be mindful of how many you eat because each almond or cashew is about 15 calories, so they can quickly make you fat if you don\u2019t pay attention.\n\nMy suggestion is I\u2019d rather you take magnesium supplements and one of the best forms is a BLEND of TRAACS\u00ae Magnesium Glycinate Chelate, Albion\u00ae Di-Magnesium Malate and Magnesium Citrate\u2026 the BLEND of different magnesium is what makes it so effective.\n\nCelery is great for lowering elevated blood pressure and works similarly to \u201cCalcium channel blocking\u201d drugs\u2026 which are designed for blood pressure problems.\n\nBut celery has NO negative side effects and it\u2019s very low in calories, so it\u2019s great all around.\n\nThe only problem is for it to be really effective, you\u2019d have to eat at least 5 POUNDS of the stuff daily.\n\nSo if you can juice it, that\u2019s great. If not, my suggestion is to take Celery Seed Extract (42.5% phthalides)\u2026 one pill is the equivalent of eating 50 lbs of celery.\n\nThat\u2019s why it works so well and is one of my favorite solutions!\n\nEnglish Hawthorn Berries\n\nThere\u2019s a special form of English Hawthorn Berry Extract that is clinically shown to support healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nOne additional (and major) benefit is that it also helps regulate your body\u2019s stress response, including lowering the stress hormone, Cortisol.\n\nThis is very important because many times our blood pressure goes up when we\u2019re under extra STRESS and English Hawthorn Berries deals with this effectively.\n\nYou would need to eat at least one cup of it daily. Don\u2019t bother drinking it because many of the benefits are in the skin as well.\n\nHowever, a faster and easier way is to simply take the extract form of it in a pill, which is the equivalent of 3 cups of berries.\n\nPomegranate is an amazing fruit with so many health benefits, especially for blood pressure.\n\nForget about drinking the juice because it\u2019ll shoot up your insulin levels, which will indirectly increase your blood pressure.\n\nBest to have the actual fruit. Or if you don\u2019t have the time to do this daily, you can use Pomegranate Extract in a pill.\n\nTomatoes have many benefits \u2014 they help with your eyes, prostate and blood pressure health.\n\nThe main reason is the Lycopene extract found in specific forms of tomato seeds.\n\nSo go ahead and add some extra tomatoes to your salad\u2026 However, to get the full scientifically proven effects, it\u2019s best to take Lycopene Extract in a pill.\n\nGrape seeds are fantastic seeds and are more effective for improved heart health than Olive Oil.\n\nFor salad dressing, I suggest using grape seed oil. But don\u2019t cook with it because it negatively changes the chemical structure of the fat.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more effective is a patented form of Grape Seed EXTRACT that\u2019s scientifically researched to help support healthy blood pressure.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a vegetable called Beetroot. Beets are great because they help increase Nitric Oxide (NO) levels in your body. This can help vasodilate and open up your arteries to help support healthy blood flow and blood pressure levels.\n\nCook them and put them on your salad. Juicing them along with your celery is also great.\n\nIf not, you can take an amino acid called L Arginine or Citrilline, which also helps boost Nitric Oxide levels.\n\nThere you have it, 8 foods that can help promote healthy blood pressure.\n\nUnfortunately, the only problem is the time, cost, and calories to eat all of these foods to get the correct amount of nutrients to see any positive benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s why most people take the extracts in a pill \u2013 that\u2019s what my parents and I do.\n\nBelow you can take a look at the exact formula we use.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "I talk a lot about the importance of having healthy blood pressure numbers not only because I have a family history of blood pressure problems\u2026 But also because blood pressure is known as the \u201csilent killer.\u201d\n\nThere are no real symptoms to warn you. And surprisingly, \u2153 of adults over the age of 20 have blood pressure problems. So the problem starts early. And the older we get, the worse the numbers become.\n\nFor example, over 60% of the population over the age of 65 has blood pressure problems. For women, it\u2019s even worse because of menopause.2,3\n\nSadly, 70% of the population doesn\u2019t even know they have blood pressure problems, which greatly increases your risk of death by 43%, in addition to other health ailments.2,3\n\nNow, before I give you the ideal blood pressure numbers, let\u2019s first talk about what the numbers even mean.\n\nThe top number, known as Systolic, refers to the amount of pressure in your arteries during the contraction of your heart muscle. The bottom number, called Diastolic, refers to your blood pressure when your heart muscle is between beats. Both numbers are important in determining the state of your heart health.\n\nNumbers greater than the ideal range, indicate that your heart is working too hard to pump blood to the rest of your body. This obviously puts more stress on your heart, as well as your veins, blood vessels, and arteries.\n\nIn fact, this puts more pressure on your brain as well!\n\nSo, what\u2019s the ideal range?\u2026 Here\u2019s a quick chart on blood pressure levels.4\n\nAs you can see, anything in the red that\u2019s over 140/90 is considered \u201chigh\u201d. The yellow zone is better, but still a problem.\n\nThe ideal range is in the green, which is LESS than 120/80. I prefer around 110/70 or 115/75.\n\nNow, the reason I like it lower is that studies1 have found that lower than 120 mmHg Systolic (top number) caused\n\n43% lower risk of cardiovascular accidents\n\n38% lower \u201cheart failure\u201d\n\n25% lower deaths from \u201cfirst\u201d heart failures\n\n17% lower heart failures\n\n11% lower cerebrovascular accidents\n\nSo lower is better, as long as you feel fine\u2026 and preferably done naturally \u2013 through specific diet, exercise, and supplements.\n\nSo if you want to live longer, having healthy blood pressure levels of 120/80 or lower is a huge benefit and a necessity for total health. I would skip the drugs and try to do it naturally with diet, exercise, and supplements.\n\nAnd this is really important if you\u2019re over the age of 40 because there is a lot of clinical evidence that aging is a major contributing factor to blood pressure problems because of the change in your hormones.\n\nAs I said, this is a very important topic to me personally, because of my family history.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nSprint Research Group, Wright JT, Jr., Williamson JD, et al.

I call it the \u201cmost powerful\u201d because:\n\nIt\u2019s all-natural and safe \u2013 so you\u2019re not going to deal with any drugs and negative side effects.\n\nIt works quickly \u2013 results are typically seen in just 30 days.\n\nIt\u2019s easy and convenient \u2013 there\u2019s no exercise or diet.

Thus, the results are easy to maintain long-term because people can stick to this proven formula.\n\nRemember, one of the biggest reasons people fail to achieve their goals \u2013 in our case \u2013 your health goals \u2013 is because it\u2019s too difficult, complicated, and hard to follow.\n\nSo the easier it is, the longer you\u2019ll stick to it, and the better the benefits.\n\nAnd I mention all of this because I have a family history of blood pressure problems, especially on my dad\u2019s side of the family. And now that my mom is in her late 70s, she\u2019s had to deal with it as well.\n\nWhich is an interesting point because \u2153 (33%) of adults in the US over the age of 20 have blood pressure problems.

    "content": "I\u2019ve talked about blood pressure problems in the past\u2026\n\nHow it\u2019s called the \u201csilent killer\u201d because there are no real symptoms letting you know you have blood pressure problems unless you take your readings throughout the day.\n\nI\u2019ve talked about how blood pressure can cause serious heart issues.\n\nBlood pressure problems can also cause fatigue, brain fog, and memory problems.\n\nBlood pressure is also known to cause erectile problems and prostate issues for guys.\n\nIn fact, blood pressure problems also accelerate hair loss.\n\nSimply put, bad blood pressure accelerates aging. And one of the primary causes of problems with blood pressure is the negative changes in your hormones, due to aging.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also very fixable and you do NOT need drugs.\n\nIn fact, a combination of 7 specific fruits and vegetables can help support healthy blood pressure. You can eat these foods separately or you can blend them into a juice or smoothie.\n\nAs you know, vegetables are always part of a healthy diet. A couple of my favorites for lowering blood pressure are kale and spinach.\n\nThe next vegetable to add to the blender is celery. They have almost no calories. However, they\u2019re great for lowering blood pressure because they work similarly to calcium channel-blocking drugs but with NO side effects.\n\nUnfortunately, you do need to consume a lot of it to get maximum benefits for healthy blood pressure.\n\nFor this reason, I take a special form of celery seed extract in a pill, 300 mg daily, which is the equivalent of taking 50 lbs of celery stalk.\n\nIt\u2019s clinically proven to work, it\u2019s easy and convenient.\n\nTomatoes contain Lycopene, a substance found in tomato seeds. It helps lower blood pressure and cholesterol, so a double benefit. I like the little baby grape tomatoes.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re not a fan of tomatoes, then you can take a Lycopene extract of about 40 mg daily.\n\nAnd the last vegetable I recommend is beets because they are high in nitric oxide, which helps open and expand your blood vessels and thus, helps support healthy blood pressure.\n\nThis is similar to how the amino acids Arginine and Citrulline work.\n\nYou can eat beets of course or add a little bit of beet juice into your blender.\n\nOut of all the fruits, berries are one of the healthiest. Their thin skin allows more nutrients to be formed from the sun and thus, they\u2019re very high in flavonoids.\n\nBlueberries, raspberries, and strawberries are very good. However, the most powerful by far for supporting healthy blood pressure is Hawthorn Berries.\n\nUnfortunately, Hawthorn Berries are hard to come by and they\u2019re not as readily available as the other berries. So, I actually take the extract form in a pill at 900 mgs daily.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s easy, convenient, and costs a fraction of the price of buying the actual Hawthorn berries. Of course, the berries taste much better than taking a pill.\n\nGrapes, similar to berries, have thin skin and are rich in health-protecting antioxidants, including resveratrol and flavonoids. These antioxidants are found mainly in the skin, stem, leaf, and most abundantly, in the SEEDS of the grapes, rather than in their pulp.\n\nDark red and purple grapes have higher antioxidants than white or green grapes.\n\nAnd this is a primary reason why red wine has some blood pressure effects \u2013 because of the grapes.\n\nThe main problem with grape juice is that it\u2019s high in calories and sugars, which can spike up your insulin levels, which can then indirectly increase your blood pressure.\n\nSo, keep an eye on the calories \u2013 don\u2019t consume more than 1 cup daily.\n\nOr you can do what I do \u2013 take grape seed extract at 300 mg daily. It\u2019s very potent, clinically proven, easy, and convenient\u2026 and has no calories.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about one of my favorite fruits, especially when it comes to healthy blood pressure and that\u2019s Pomegranates.\n\nThey taste great, especially with a little bit of salt.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s a very messy fruit and it\u2019s time-consuming to take apart each of the seeds. So, it\u2019s easier to just drink the juice.\n\nHowever, just like grape juice, it is high in calories. Make sure you limit it to just one cup daily and read the labels to make sure it doesn\u2019t contain any added sugars. Just pure juice.\n\nAlternatively, you can take Pomegranate Extract at about 200 mgs daily \u2013 which is what I do.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m all about convenience and ease. If it\u2019s too difficult, I won\u2019t stick to it long-term and that\u2019s just how most of us are.\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 the 7 best vegetables and fruits for supporting healthy blood pressure. You can make it into one big juice or smoothie and drink it daily.\n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t want to go through all the trouble of buying, blending, and cleaning every day, which most people don\u2019t or simply don\u2019t stick to after a week or two\u2026 then just visit this special link and use the same natural formula my family and I use for healthy blood pressure naturally.\n\nIt contains all of these ingredients and added vitamins and minerals. It\u2019s clinically researched. It\u2019s easy, convenient, has no calories, and best of all \u2013 it has over a 10+ year proven track record for effectiveness and safety.\n\nHowever, no matter what you do \u2013 please make sure you do something to support healthy blood pressure today!\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2954442/",

    "content": "Most people think that \u201cheart\u201d conditions and blood pressure problems are more of a \u201cman\u2019s\u201d problem, but it\u2019s actually the opposite!\n\nIn fact, blood pressure problems affect more women than men!\n\nDid you know that if you\u2019re a woman, aside from smoking \u2026 your biggest risk factor for having heart problems is blood pressure?\u2026\n\nAnd this is because women have smaller blood vessels in the heart, making them more vulnerable to blood pressure and inflammation of the blood vessels.\n\nIn fact, the statistics are startling\u2026.\n\nBlood pressure problems affect one in four women, and kill significantly more women than men:\n\n59% of women compared to 44% of men with blood pressure problems, according to American Heart Association\u2019s 2016 statistics.\n\nBy the way, your goal for healthy blood pressure levels should be 120/80 or lower.\n\nWhat Causes Blood Pressure Problems In Women?\n\nPregnancy: The increased blood volume required to nurture a growing fetus\u2014can potentially raise blood pressure to extremely high levels. For this reason, expectant mothers also should have blood pressure readings taken often. Also, blood pressure problems can develop rapidly in the last three months of pregnancy. When this happens, a woman may need treatment\u2014even after delivery.\n\nMenopause: Normal age-related hormonal declines, often cause a woman\u2019s arteries to become less elastic and more constrictive, thus contributing to blood pressure problems. Unfortunately, giving women synthetic hormones (estrogen and especially progesterone) makes this situation only worse.\n\nMetabolic Syndrome: Data from a five-year National Health and Nutrition Examination study of adults with blood pressure problems revealed what causes it in women: imbalance in cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, and excess abdominal fat. These are typically associated with \u201cmetabolic syndrome\u201d, which often leads to heart and blood sugar problems.\n\nPain Medications DOUBLES The Problem\n\nA report from the Harvard School of Medicine revealed that women taking painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) increased their risk for blood pressure problems by almost 100%\n\nThat\u2019s DOUBLE the rate!\n\nAnd this is because of the fluid retention and decreased kidney function due to these drugs.\n\nSo, only take these drugs occasionally, as needed, and definitely not daily or more than 3x weekly. By the way, aspirin does not cause blood pressure problems, but it has its own set of negative side effects.\n\nSynthetic Hormones Make Thing Worse\n\nSynthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as medroxyprogesterone found in drugs like Progestin and Provera, can also intensify blood pressure problems by causing blood vessels to constrict.\n\nAdditionally, an increase in progesterone causes a decrease in estrogen, which is NOT what you want because estrogen tends to help blood pressure in women.\n\nIronically, higher estrogen levels in men increase blood pressure.\n\n5 Best Ways For Women To Protect Themselves From Blood Pressure Problems\n\nManage your stress levels \u2013 sleep better, journal, relax, and be more mindful of your feelings. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff\u201d.\n\nEat better \u2013 more healthy fats, fish, fiber, and vegetables, while decreasing carbs, sugars, alcohol, and processed foods.\n\nExercise regularly \u2013 walking and lifting weights are best, 3-4x weekly is plenty.\n\nTake natural herbs and vitamins that are clinically proven to help support healthy blood pressure \u2013 such as Hawthorne Berry, Grape Seed, Celery Seed, Pomegranate and Lycopene extract\u2026 Along with Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium, D3, and B6.\n\nRemember, women really need to be careful with their blood pressure, especially if they\u2019re over the age of 40 and are pre-menopausal or have gone through menopause.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/1-cause-of-high-blood-pressure-hypertension-shocking-facts/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve talked a lot about blood pressure in the past \u2013 causes, and solutions. I\u2019ve done this because it\u2019s called the \u201csilent killer\u201d \u2013 there are no symptoms for it.\n\nIt\u2019s a very common health issue, especially as you get older \u2013 so I decided to update this topic in 2025.\n\nSome people think it\u2019s having headaches or being dizzy or something similar \u2013 but, it\u2019s not. Lots of things can cause these situations.\n\nAnd of course, blood pressure can lead to serious heart problems.\n\nAdditionally, going from problematic blood pressure (over 140/90 mmHg) to healthy levels (120/80 mmHg), let alone to ideal blood pressure levels (115/75 mmHg) dramatically improves your life by1\n\n38% lower risk of heart problems;\n\n43% lower risk of cardiovascular events;\n\n27% lower risk of mortality overall.\n\nThus, you\u2019re going to live a much longer and healthier life simply by having healthy blood pressure, which is a big deal because it can easily be done and you do NOT need drugs.\n\nHowever, today I\u2019m going to reveal the #1 cause of blood pressure problems and NO, it\u2019s not your diet, lack of exercise, or stress!\n\n#1 Cause Of Blood Pressure Problems\n\nIt\u2019s because of the negative changes in your hormones, due to AGING!\n\nI\u2019ll show you the clinical stats in a bit. However, I know this to be very true because of my own family and especially my parents. And you can get the details below on how I lowered their blood pressure naturally.\n\nBut don\u2019t go there just yet.\n\nFirst, take a look at the stats and chart from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) of blood pressure problems among adults2 over the age of 18 between 2015-2016.\n\nThe first bar on the left that\u2019s kinda black, shows the TOTAL number of people who have blood pressure problems. Basically, it\u2019s 30% of the population over the age of 18. That\u2019s a lot.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that this does NOT take into account PRE-condition numbers, which means even more people have \u201calmost\u201d problematic blood pressure and don\u2019t even know it.\n\nThe second gray bar shows the % from age 18-to 39. Men are 9.2% and women 5.6%. It\u2019s not much, but the numbers are higher by 2% compared to 2013, just 2-3 years before and they are even high in 2018.3\n\nSo, things are NOT improving.\n\nThe third green bar shows the % for aged 40-59. Men are at 37.2% and women at 29.4%. This is a MASSIVE jump, up 420% for men and a whopping 525% for women!!!\n\nWhy such a huge jump all of a sudden?\u2026\n\nBecause men\u2019s testosterone starts to decline in their late 20s and even more so in their 30s. However, there\u2019s a huge drop starting in his 40s and it\u2019s called \u201candropause\u201d.\n\nAnd women start \u201cmenopause\u201d in their 40s as well, which causes massive negative changes in all their hormones \u2013 estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, adrenal, and thyroid hormones.\n\nFinally, the fourth lighter-green bar shows the % for those aged 60 and over. Men are 58.5% and women 66.8%. Both age groups are significantly worse.\n\nBut the women are much worse because the negative changes in hormones because of menopause are more dramatic than in men\u2019s \u201candropause\u201d.\n\nSo What Does This Mean For You?\n\nWell, you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cgreat, there\u2019s nothing I can do. I can\u2019t turn back time, so I guess this is it?!!\u201d\n\nNo, this just means you have to be more proactive about monitoring your blood pressure levels as you age, especially after the age of 40.\n\nNow, the best way to find solutions to problems is to know the CAUSE of it.\n\nSo what you need to do is make some simple lifestyle changes and utilize specific nutrients that a more \u201cmature\u201d body needs, because of the changes in hormones, \u2026 so your body can help heal itself naturally, from within.\n\nThis is the ONLY long-term, safe solution for healthy blood pressure and overall health\u2026 and I think you\u2019d agree with this.\n\nUnfortunately, Pharmaceutical companies (and most doctors) don\u2019t want to deal with the cause. They just want to \u201cmask\u201d the symptoms with drugs.\n\nIn fact, this is why there are over 75 different blood pressure drugs with over a dozen different mechanisms.\n\nThis is also why most people with blood pressure problems end up taking on average 2 drugs AT THE SAME TIME, to make improvements.\n\nI know this because both my parents, my aunts, and my uncles were dealing with all of these same situations.\n\nOf course, if you have extremely big blood pressure problems, such as 180/120, then you MUST take a drug right away to lower it fast and get it under control immediately.\n\nHowever, even in these extreme situations, this type of person will eventually need to find natural solutions because you should NOT be taking drugs, long-term, for the rest of your life.\n\nWe ALL know this \u2013 it\u2019s just too toxic and they have too many negative side effects.\n\nYES, lifestyle matters because:\n\nDIET \u2013 what you put in your body (food and liquids)\n\nEXERCISE \u2013 how much, how often, and what kind\n\nSTRESS MANAGEMENT \u2013 emotional and physical\n\nSUPPLEMENTS \u2013 herbs, plant extracts, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids\n\n\u2026 ALL affect your hormones and turn genes ON or OFF.\n\nAnyway, just because you\u2019re getting \u201colder\u201d, does NOT mean you have to look and feel \u201cold\u201d and deal with the potential health problems\u2026 one of them being blood pressure.\n\nNow I\u2019ve got two special links for you:\n\nFirst is the natural option my dad and mom used to support healthy blood pressure naturally. No drugs. No crazy diets or exercise programs\n\nThe second link reveals the 8 best foods that are clinically proven to help support healthy blood pressure: 8 Foods For Healthy Blood Pressure.\n\nThese solutions work at any age, for men and women.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nSprint Research Group, Wright JT, Jr., Williamson JD, et al.

    "content": "Did you know that high blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most important risk factors for premature death?\u2026\n\nIt accounts for over 50% of all deaths caused by cardiovascular issues and 14% of all total deaths each year!\n\nGlobally, high blood pressure affects 27% of the population and the stats are even worse in the US, about 35% of the population!\n\nAnd get this, it has been estimated that 90% of Americans are expected to develop high blood pressure by the age of 65!!!\n\nMy Personal Struggles\n\nI\u2019m very familiar with the stats because I have a family history of high blood pressure (my dad\u2019s side), causing heart attacks and strokes.\n\nWith this in mind, it\u2019s no exaggeration that I urge you to keep your blood pressure in a healthy range because it is one of the most important things you can do to help extend your lifespan and reduce cardiovascular and brain problems.\n\n\u201cNormal\u201d Is Still Too High\n\nThe newest research suggests that even \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure (120\u2013129 / 80\u201384 mmHg) increases the risk of death from cardiovascular problems by 46% on average.\n\nFor women, the risk was slightly lower. But for men, it was much higher\u201480%, regardless of age.1\n\nThese results are alarming in light of the fact that 33% US citizens have blood pressure in the 129\u2013139 / 84\u201395 mmHg range.\n\nMaking the problem worse, studies have shown that prescription drugs for \u201chigh normal\u201d blood pressure and even mild hypertension may not be effective.\n\nA large review of randomized, clinical trials performed by the prestigious Cochrane Collaboration found that anti-hypertensive drugs used to treat mild hypertension (140\u2013159 / 90\u201399 mm/Hg) did not reduce complications or the risk of death.2\n\nOf course, I believe you should take medications and listen to your doctor\u2026 but AFTER you first try to fix things NATURALLY! (see below)\n\nWhat Does All Of This Mean For You?\u2026\n\nEven mild hypertension, while still in the \u201cnormal\u201d range, can nearly double your risk of heart problems and thus, potentially lead to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nSo we need to make sure your blood pressure is under control, preferably in the healthier \u201clow/normal\u201d range.\n\nAgain, the goal is to not use drugs at first because of the negative side effects.\n\nBesides, if you don\u2019t fix the underlying problems that are causing blood pressure problems, you\u2019ll need to keep increasing the drugs over time, which means problems.\n\nSo that means we need to\u2026\n\nImprove Your Blood Pressure, Naturally\n\nAs I said earlier, because I have a family history of high blood pressure, I\u2019ve had to figure out the BEST ways to promote healthy blood pressure naturally \u2013 so there\u2019s hope.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you can do it and it\u2019ll be much easier than you think.\n\nLike most other chronic health problems, high blood pressure can be caused by your\n\nand the modern diet and lifestyle.\n\nHigh blood pressure affects only one percent of hunter-gatherer populations following a traditional diet.\n\nHowever, its prevalence increases when those cultures adopt a western diet and lifestyle that is characterized by\n\nprocessed and refined foods\n\nchronic sleep deprivation\n\nbeing overworked/stressed\n\na lack of sun exposure\n\nand excess use of caffeine, alcohol and tobacco.3\n\nIf you have elevated blood pressure, here are my top 3 suggestions for supporting healthy blood pressure within a normal range, naturally:\n\nRemember that your genes and hormones are the primary controlling factors in how you look and feel. And, what you EAT controls your hormones and thus, dictates \u201cgene expression\u201d.\n\nEating the wrong foods, causes a change in your hormones, triggering your genes to \u201ccome alive\u201d and for some of us who are \u201csensitive\u201d to high blood pressure (like my dad and myself), it can cause unhealthy blood pressure levels.\n\nSo with that said, here\u2019s what you should pay attention to:\n\nLess Sugar & Simple Carbohydrates \u2013 When your blood sugar spikes up, typically from eating sugar (found in foods, sodas, etc.) or from processed/refined carbohydrates (white bread, pasta, pastries, etc.), your blood pressure goes up and blood flow decreases.4\n\nMore Vegetables & Fruits \u2013 These foods have higher levels of potassium, magnesium, minerals and vitamins which help promote healthy blood pressure.5,6In fact, this is why Blood Pressure Optimizer, utilizes the most potent herbal extracts from Hawthorn Berries, Grape Seeds, Celery Seeds, Pomegranate and tomatoes.\n\nLess Meat & More Fish \u2013 Cold water fish has many blood pressure-lowering benefits, primarily because of the healthy fats (EPA, DHA, polyunsaturated).7 The very opposite of modern-day meats.If you don\u2019t want to take fish oil pills, just have cold water fish 3-4x weekly. Wild-caught salmon is ideal because it has higher levels of healthy omega fats and less contamination.\n\nThere\u2019s more, but this is a good start. Of course, drink more water and fewer \u201cother\u201d liquids!\n\nThere\u2019s more you can do here, but I\u2019ll keep it simple\n\nLose Weight \u2013 Being overweight is never good, and this includes high blood pressure. I\u2019ll talk about this in detail in a future article.\n\nExercise \u2013 You don\u2019t need much. Just get out and WALK daily, even if it\u2019s just 3x a week for only 15-20 minutes. Later you can add in weight training, which is much better.\n\nSleep \u2013 My sleep is horrible and as we get older, it seems to get worse for most of us. Try to get to bed earlier. Exercise helps. Taking specific \u201csleep\u201d herbs will also help.\n\nGo Outside \u2013 Sunlight helps promote healthy blood pressure because of improved cortisol and Vitamin D levels. And by walking outside 3x weekly, you\u2019ll get two benefits in one.\n\nRelax \u2013 We live in stressful times, so you need to take a \u201ctime-out\u201d daily and relax, which helps lower stress hormones. You can meditate, do deep breathing, take a nap, get a massage or just go for a quick walk outside.\n\nIf you do just ONE thing, my suggestion is to get outside and take a walk daily. It pretty much does all the above all at once =)\n\nThe right supplements, similar to food, can positively affect your hormones and can help promote healthy blood pressure levels naturally, without any of the negative side effects of drugs.\n\nCombined with a better diet and lifestyle, you\u2019re good to go.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of the best supplements, that are clinically researched to work:\n\nGrape Seed Extract \u2013 There is a patented form called MegaNatural-BP (US patent 6,544,581), which is clinically shown to work in only 30 days.10\n\nEnglish Hawthorne Berry Extract \u2013 Helps support strong contractile force in the heart and supports cardiovascular health.11,12\n\nCelery Seed Extract \u2013 Works similar to calcium channel blocking drugs, but without the negative drug side effects. Has many vascular benefits.13\n\nPomegranate Extract \u2013 A compound found only in pomegranates called punicalagin, has been shown to support healthy pressure in a normal range and increase the speed at which heart blockages are caused by high levels of bad cholesterol.14\n\nLycopene Extract \u2013 This is a substance normally found in tomato seeds. It helps support healthy blood pressure levels within a normal range, antioxidant, and arterial health.15\n\nWell, there are other supplements too\u2026 Such as Magnesium, Potassium, L-Arginine and certain vitamins.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a simple and time-test solution that contains all of these ingredients in one, convenient pill\u2026 then I\u2019d suggest you try Blood Pressure Optimizer\u2122\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 my blood pressure levels are all over the place and my doctor has me on various drugs to lower it. Before the drugs, I was around 160-180 systolic and with the drugs I\u2019m around 120-150. Sorry, I don\u2019t remember the bottom number. Unfortunately, I feel horrible with the lower blood pressure, shouldn\u2019t I feel better? Honestly, I felt fine with the higher blood pressure. What\u2019s the best BP levels for me?\u201d\n\nThis is a very important question because \u2153 of adults over the age of 20 have blood pressure problems. And the older we get, the worse the numbers become.\n\nFor example, over 60% of the population over the age of 65 has blood pressure problems. For women, it\u2019s even worse because of menopause.2,3\n\nSadly, 70% of the population doesn\u2019t even know they have blood pressure problems, which greatly increases your risk of death by 43%, in addition to other health ailments.2,3\n\nNow, before I get to Linda\u2019s question, here\u2019s a quick chart on blood pressure levels.\n\nAs you can see, anything in the red that\u2019s over 140/90 is considered \u201chigh\u201d blood pressure. The yellow zone is better, but still a problem.\n\nThe ideal range is in the green, which is LESS than 120/80. I prefer around 110/70.\n\nNow, the reason I like it lower is that studies1 have found that lower than 120 mmHg Systolic (top number) caused\n\n43% lower risk of cardiovascular events\n\n38% lower \u201cheart failure\u201d\n\nSo lower is better, as long as you feel fine\u2026 and preferably done naturally \u2013 through specific diet, exercise, and supplements.\n\nNow, getting back to Linda\u2019s question \u2013 she feels worse with the \u201clower\u201d numbers because of the prescription drugs. So, that\u2019s the first thing I want to point out.\n\nSecondly, she stated that she \u201cfelt fine\u201d when her levels were higher. This is another problem with blood pressure. You feel fine because there aren\u2019t any real symptoms. That\u2019s why it\u2019s known as the \u201csilent killer\u201d.\n\nSo if you want to live longer, lowering your blood pressure levels below 120/80 is a huge benefit and a necessity for total health. I would try to do it naturally.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nSprint Research Group, Wright JT, Jr., Williamson JD, et al.

    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from Davey and he asks:\n\n\u201cHow can I lower my blood pressure naturally? I\u2019m tired of dealing with the negative side effects of medications. And for whatever reason, diet and exercise doesn\u2019t seem to help that much.\u201d\n\nThis is a really important question because most people don\u2019t know that high blood pressure (hypertension) is the most important risk factor for premature deaths\u2026\n\nIt accounts for over 50% of all deaths caused by cardiovascular problems and 14% of all total deaths each year!\n\nGlobally, high blood pressure affects 27% of the population and the stats are even worse in the US, about 35% of the population!\n\nAnd get this, it has been estimated that 90% of Americans are expected to develop high blood pressure by the age of 65.\n\nMy Personal Struggles\n\nI\u2019m very familiar with the stats because I have a family history of high blood pressure (my dad\u2019s side), which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nWith this in mind, it\u2019s no exaggeration that I urge you to keep your blood pressure under control because it is one of the most important things you can do to extend your lifespan and reduce health problems (brain & heart).\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s much easier than you think and I\u2019ll give you my favorite natural solution at the end of this video. It\u2019s what my dad and I use every day.\n\n\u201cNormal\u201d Is Still Too High\n\nThe newest research suggests that even \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure (120\u2013129 / 80\u201384 mmHg) increases the risk of death from cardiovascular problems by 46% on average.\n\nFor women, the risk was slightly lower. But for men, it was much higher\u201480%, regardless of age.1\n\nThese results are alarming in light of the fact that 33% US citizens have blood pressure in the normal/high range (129\u2013139 / 84\u201395 mmHg)\u2026.\n\nWhich means things are way worse for you.\n\nMaking the problem worse, studies have shown that some prescription drugs for \u201chigh normal\u201d blood pressure and even mild hypertension are not very effective in some people.\n\nA large review of randomized, clinical trials (performed by the prestigious Cochrane Collaboration) found that anti-hypertensive drugs used to treat mild hypertension (140\u2013159 / 90\u201399 mm/Hg) did not reduce complications or the risk of death.2\n\nWhat Does All Of This Mean For You?\u2026\n\nEven mild hypertension, while still in the \u201cnormal\u201d range, can nearly double your risk of heart problems and thus, may potentially lead to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nSo we need to make sure your blood pressure is under control, preferably in the \u201clow/normal\u201d range.\n\nThe truth is that most people do NOT need drugs and thus, have to deal with the negative side effects that may be associated to prescription medications.\n\nAt the very least, even if you are going to take drugs, you SHOULD and MUST improve your lifestyle (diet, exercise, stress management, sleep, supplements, etc.), so that you need a lower dose of drugs.\n\nLower Your Blood Pressure, Naturally\n\nLike I said earlier because I have a family history of high blood pressure, I\u2019ve had to figure out the BEST ways to help support healthy blood pressure levels within a normal and youthful range.\n\nSo there\u2019s hope and I\u2019ll share with you one of my favorite solutions at the end of this article.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you can do it and it\u2019ll be much easier than you think.\n\nThis is really important for those that can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to make improvements in diet or exercise.\n\nLike many health problems, high blood pressure has been linked to your genes, aging, hormonal imbalances and the modern UNHEALTHY diet and lifestyle.\n\nHigh blood pressure affects only 1% of hunter-gatherer populations following a traditional diet,\u2026. but its prevalence increases when those cultures who adopt a western diet and lifestyle \u2026\n\nprocessed and refined foods\n\nchronic sleep deprivation\n\nbeing overworked/stressed\n\na lack of sun exposure\n\nand excess use of caffeine, alcohol and tobacco.3\n\n\u2026 so if you have elevated blood pressure in an unhealthy range, here are my top 3 suggestions for promoting healthy blood pressure naturally.\n\n1 \u2013 Right & Wrong FOODS\n\nRemember that your genes and hormones are the primary controlling factors in how you look and feel.\n\nAnd, what you EAT controls your hormones and thus, dictates \u201cgene expression\u201d.\n\nEating the wrong foods, causes a change in your hormones, triggering your genes to \u201ccome alive\u201d and for some of us who are \u201csensitive\u201d to high blood pressure (like my dad and myself), it can cause unhealthy blood pressure levels.\n\nSo with that said, here\u2019s what you should pay attention to:\n\nLess Sugar & Simple Carbohydrates \u2013 When your blood sugar spikes up, typically from eating sugar (found in foods, sodas, etc.) or from processed/refined carbohydrates (white bread, pasta, pastries, etc.), your blood pressure goes up and blood flow decreases.4\n\nMore Vegetables & Fruits \u2013 These foods have higher levels of potassium, magnesium, minerals and vitamins which help promote healthy blood pressure.5,6In fact, this is why Blood Pressure Optimizer, utilizes healthy and proven herbs, such as Hawthorn Berries, Grape Seeds, Celery Seeds, Pomegranate and Lycopene.\n\nLess Meat & More Fish \u2013 Cold water fish has many healthy blood pressure benefits, primarily because of the healthy fats (EPA, DHA, polyunsaturated).7 The very opposite of modern-day meats.Wild-caught salmon is ideal because it has higher levels of healthy omega fats and less contamination.Alternatively, you can take at least 3 grams of fish oil pills.\n\nThere\u2019s more, but this is a good start. Of course, drink more water and fewer \u201cother\u201d liquids (juices, soda, etc)!\n\n2 \u2013 Healthy Lifestyle\n\nThere\u2019s more you can do here, but I\u2019ll keep it simple\n\nLose Weight \u2013 Being overweight is never good for your body, and this includes unhealthy blood pressure.\n\nExercise \u2013 You don\u2019t need much. Just get out and WALK daily, even if it\u2019s just 3x a week for only 15-20 minutes. Later you can add in weight training, which is much better.\n\nSleep \u2013 My sleep is horrible and as we get older, it seems to get worse for most of us. Try to get to bed earlier. Reduce \u201clight\u201d from your computer, cell phones and TV. Exercise helps.\n\nGo Outside \u2013 Sunlight helps promote healthy blood pressure. And by walking outside 3x weekly, you\u2019ll get two benefits in one.\n\nRelax \u2013 We live in stressful times, so you need to take a \u201ctime-out\u201d daily and relax. You can meditate, do deep breathing, take a nap, get a massage or just go for a quick walk outside.\n\nIf you do just ONE thing, my suggestion is to get outside and take a walk daily. It pretty much does all the above all at once and it\u2019s FREE =)\n\n3 \u2013 The Correct Herbal Extracts\n\nThe right supplements, similar to food, can positively affect your hormones and can help support healthy blood pressure within a normal range, without any of the negative side effects of drugs.\n\nCombined with a better diet and lifestyle, you\u2019re good to go.\n\nThis is why I formulated Blood Pressure Optimizer for dad and myself. It\u2019s safe and works quickly because it utilizes clinically researched, natural ingredients such as:\n\nGrape Seed Extract \u2013 There is a patented form called MegaNatural-BP (US patent 6,544,581), which is clinically shown to support healthy blood pressure within a normal range, in only 30 days.8\n\nEnglish Hawthorne Berry Extract \u2013 Helps support strong contractile force in the heart and improves heart health.9,10\n\nCelery Seed Extract \u2013 Works similar to calcium channel blocking drugs, but without the negative drug side effects. Has many vascular benefits \u2013 for both your heart and brain.11\n\nPomegranate Extract \u2013 A compound found only in pomegranates called punicalagin, has been shown to support healthy blood pressure and reduce the potential of blockages in the arteries.12\n\nLycopene Extract \u2013 This is a substance normally found in tomato seeds. Studies have shown it can help support healthy blood pressure, arterial and blood vessel health.13\n\nWell, there are other ingredients too\u2026 Such as Magnesium, Potassium, L-Arginine and specific vitamins.\n\nEither way, Blood Pressure Optimizer is a great and simple start, while you slowly implement healthy lifestyle changes.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/177\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895954\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22615114?dopt=AbstractPlus\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20497980?dopt=AbstractPlus\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15699220?dopt=AbstractPlus\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22051430?dopt=AbstractPlus\n\nhttp://pmid.us/10454450\n\nhttp://www.polyphenolics.com/2012/02/polyphenolics-announces-that-the-fourth-u-s-patent-has-been-granted-for-meganatural-bp/\n\nhttp://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/herb/hawthorn#ixzz3ZGAKkDdF\n\nhttp://www.drugs.com/npp/hawthorn.html\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23735001\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15158307\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512210004469",

    "content": "Most people, especially doctors\u2026 try to get healthy blood pressure by using harmful prescription drugs. But as you may already know, these medications are just loaded with lots of negative side effects.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate because proven natural alternatives already exist, that are safer and work better than blood pressure medications.\n\nHowever, what you (and your doctor) should really be doing is trying to control, reduce and potentially eliminate the CAUSES of blood pressure problems\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\n\nTake a quick look at the below info-graphic and discover the top 10 causes of blood pressure problems. And make sure to read my summary & overview at the end.\n\nThe above info-graphic points out some very important facts that most people don\u2019t know or realize, and this includes your doctor! So, let me quickly cover each of them:\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize that AGE is one of the BIGGEST factors for blood pressure problems. I discuss this in my very important article, but what\u2019s important to note is that after the age of 40, 33% of the population has blood pressure problems and after the age of 60, over 71% of the population has blood pressure problems!\n\nSo, if you\u2019re over the age of 40 and have blood pressure problems, it may not be your fault. But it IS your responsibility to fix it right away.\n\n2. Genetics & Family History\n\nWell, not much can be done here. This is in fact my own problem because I have a family history (on my dad\u2019s side) of blood pressure problems.\n\nYou can read more about it, including my personal favorite solution that my dad, my family, and I use to support healthy blood pressure levels, naturally!\n\nCome on people, smoking has NO health benefits. STOP smoking!\n\nA little bit of alcohol is okay, especially if it\u2019s organic red wine. But drinking every night will cause damage to your heart, arteries, and liver. Alcohol is toxic and it\u2019s acidic, both being bad for your body.\n\nSimilar to smoking, being overweight has no health benefits. And the older you get, the harder it is to lose that unwanted fat.\n\nSalt has its benefits actually. Regular table salt or salt found in processed foods and packages is BAD for you. However, \u201cnatural\u201d salts such as Himalayan rock or Celtic sea salt is GOOD for you and can actually help support healthy blood pressure. I\u2019ll discuss this in a future article.\n\nWell \u2013 know stress is bad. However, you can\u2019t get rid of it. What\u2019s important is the MEANING you give to stressful situations.\n\nIf you freak out, get negative and focus on the problem the entire time \u2026 you put your body under extra stress. The secret is to focus on the SOLUTION and to know that \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d and worrying about the problem isn\u2019t going to help anything\u2026 Especially our blood pressure or heart.\n\n8. Lack Of Physical Activity\n\nWe sit too much these days. Just get outside and walk daily, even if it\u2019s just for 15-20 minutes. It\u2019ll do wonders for your physical AND mental health!\n\nIronically, many \u201cheart\u201d medications actually cause more heart PROBLEMS in the long run. They can increase your cholesterol, blood sugar, or blood pressure levels. They can decrease blood flow and circulation.\n\nAnd they all cause extra stress on your liver and kidneys, which then cause more problems for your heart.\n\nWhenever possible, take FEWER drugs and utilize natural solutions. Nature has the answers, NOT the pharmaceutical companies!\n\n10. Medical Conditions\n\nThis goes back to \u201cgenetics\u201d. And if you know you have a genetic \u201cproblem\u201d, which is making things worse, then you MUST make changes to your lifestyle because your body is more sensitive than the average person.\n\nThis is a similar problem with my dad and why he had a stroke.\n\nPlease take action right now, and support healthy blood pressure levels because I don\u2019t want you to become another statistic!\n\nHow My Dad Got Healthy Blood Pressure In Only 30 Days \u00bb",
