    "content": "I find it interesting how people self-sabotage so much. For example, they want to make more money and yet, they spend their money on stupid stuff they don\u2019t need. And waste time nights and weekends watching TV, when they could be learning and earning more money.\n\nOr they say they want to be in a happy relationship and yet, they keep getting involved with toxic people who they allow to mistreat them.\n\nAnd the same thing with health, people say they want to be healthier and they don\u2019t do the basics \u2013 eat better, move more, manage their stress, and take essential supplements.\n\nSo today\u2019s topic is about alcohol and how it\u2019s killing your body and brain and how to reverse the damage.\n\nSecond to caffeine, alcohol is the most abused drug on the planet.\n\nYES, alcohol is a drug.\n\nPeople say they want more energy, better-functioning brains, they want to be happier, look younger, have better hormones, lose fat, gain muscle, live longer, sleep better, and so on and so forth, and yet, these same people drink alcohol \u2026 which causes negative effects in everything I just mentioned and more.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, or how you justify it \u2013 alcohol is a toxin that accelerates the aging process of your entire body.\n\nSure, you\u2019ll find a study that says how alcohol is good for your health or some other bullshit\u2026 or drinking two glasses of wine daily is good for your heart.\n\nIf you want the benefits of red wine for example \u2013 go eat some organic red grapes. It\u2019s the polyphenols, resveratrol, and similar compounds that are found in thin-skinned fruits, that are good for your body.\n\nNOT the red wine which is basically, grape juice mixed with alcohol.\n\nOr, you can have some organic extra virgin olive oil which is super high in polyphenols or even really good quality, caffeine-free coffee or best of all, green tea.\n\nAll have proven to be good for your health.\n\nAnyway, I can go on and on with the negatives of alcohol. Not just in the short term, but for sure in the long run.\n\nFor example, I get guys complaining about not gaining muscle, and yet, they\u2019re drinking alcohol \u2013 beer of all things, which is the worst.\n\nI hear women who are struggling to lose fat and you see them drinking wine and sugary cocktails.\n\nListen, alcohol decreases testosterone, lowers GH and thyroid, increases insulin, increases stress hormones and creates hormonal imbalances.\n\nPlus, it creates negative changes in dopamine, serotonin, and other brain chemicals.\n\nIt\u2019s also terrible for your gut health, which controls so many health factors in your entire body.\n\nNot to mention, alcohol completely disrupts your sleep pattern and decreases REM and quality of sleep, which causes even more hormonal imbalances.\n\nGive Up Alcohol for Good?\n\nOf course, the best solution is to just stop drinking alcohol.\n\nHowever, I know as I say this, many people are thinking \u201cUmm\u2026 okay Dr. Sam, you\u2019re nuts, ain\u2019t no way that\u2019s going to happen\u201d\n\nSo, try to reduce it as much as possible.\n\nDon\u2019t drink because you\u2019re bored or lonely. Don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking you\u2019re doing something healthy by drinking your wine.\n\nMaybe just save it for social events. So, that\u2019s the first step.\n\nStrengthen Your Liver\n\nThe next thing I want you to do is detoxify & strengthen your liver.\n\nSo take 600-1200 mg of N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), with about 500-1,000 mg of Milk Thistle 80% extract, before you go drinking. And if you drink a lot, then take the same dose again, when you get home.\n\nThe stronger your liver is, the faster it\u2019ll get the alcohol out of your system and reduce some of the damage.\n\nMake sure you also hydrate your body by drinking more water. Add in some salt, potassium and magnesium as well for electrolyte balance.\n\nFinally, the type of alcohol you drink is also a factor.\n\nAvoid beer, it\u2019s one of the worst. It\u2019s horrible for your testosterone levels and it increases estrogen. It also causes inflammation and irritates the gut more than others.\n\nAvoid sugary and fruity drinks. They taste good, but you do NOT need the extra sugar and increased blood sugar.\n\nI know there are a lot of wine drinkers. Red wine is better than white, even though white has less sugar. Remember that most wines do NOT contain organic grapes, so you\u2019re dealing with lots of pesticides, which is horrible for your health, especially your gut.\n\nThe best alcohol or the least damaging is probably Vodka and maybe Tequila. Straight up.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed a lot of people do during because of social anxiety. Alcohol helps you connect with people and lowers your inhibitions and relaxes you.\n\nI get it\u2026 Especially since I\u2019m an introvert.\n\nYou can help your body produce similar \u201cfeel good\u201d chemicals naturally \u2013 such as GABA, Dopamine and serotonin, by taking specific herbs that help lower anxiety and increase confidence.\n\nThat\u2019s what I do if I need to \u201ctake the edge off\u201d at some social events.\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated, alcohol has NO health benefits, no matter what anyone tells you or is \u201cselling\u201d you or trying to \u201cjustify\u201d their position.\n\nI guess there\u2019s probably ONE benefit and that\u2019s in social events and you having a good time with your friends.\n\nBasically, my goal is to bring awareness to this topic since people never give it a second thought. Reduce alcohol as much as you can. Save it for \u201cimportant\u201d events.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is YOUR health.\n\nI know a lot of long-time drinkers, not alcoholics. But people who have been drinking casually and socially for years and years\u2026 Now, in their 40s, 50s and beyond, they have health problems related to alcohol.\n\nYou can\u2019t cheat nature. You will always pay the price, sooner or later.\n\nI\u2019m not here to judge. I\u2019m here to help improve your health, fitness and longevity, and alcohol doesn\u2019t fit into that formula.\n\nLike I said earlier, you can always improve your mood and lower anxiety with specific herbs.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/the-major-health-problem-with-energy-drinks-and-caffeine/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and \u201cenergy drinks\u201d are super popular, more than ever. In fact, it\u2019s a multi-billion dollar industry.9 The reason they\u2019re so popular is that:\n\npeople think they\u2019re \u201chealthy\u201d\n\nand of course, they give you lots of energy due to the high caffeine dose\n\nUnfortunately, Energy Drinks Are HORRIBLE For Your Health\n\nYes\u2026 but that\u2019s because they either have lots of sugar (over 60 grams and 250 calories worth)\u2026. Or the sugar-free ones are loaded with toxic artificial sweeteners.\n\nAre they healthy for you?\n\nNope! Just because they contain a few vitamins, doesn\u2019t mean they are healthy. In fact, they create an imbalance in vitamins.\n\nSecondly, they make your body very acidic which is known to cause health problems and accelerate aging.9\n\nEnergy drinks are linked to many health problems, but these are the big ones in my opinion:\n\nHeart problems \u2014 faster heart rate, high blood pressure, etc.\n\nPhysical problems \u2014 headaches, sleep difficulties5, arthritis3, erectile problems, and poor blood flow11.\n\nEmotional problems \u2014 anxiety, panic attacks, nervousness, and depression.7\n\nDo they give you energy?\n\nYes, they do, but that\u2019s because of the massive dose of CAFFEINE they contain! Some contain as much as 500 mgs of caffeine10. That\u2019s 3-4 cups of strong coffee.\n\nTrust me, take out the caffeine and there is no \u201cenergy\u201d in these drinks.\n\nVitamins don\u2019t give you energy, they help FOOD convert to energy. But even then, you need the CORRECT BALANCE of vitamins.\n\nMost energy drinks just have 1-2 vitamins at massive dosages, which creates an imbalance and toxicity.\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of problems with energy drinks, but \u2026\n\nThe WORST Problem Of All\n\nHowever, in my PERSONAL opinion, the WORST problem with energy drinks is the caffeine consumption and the negative change in your hormones due to the RISE in your \u201cstress hormone\u201d called, cortisol!\n\nAt the end of the day, the elevation in this stress hormone is the cause of many of the above mentioned negative effects.\n\nWe already live in stressful times, with lots of responsibilities and many of us aren\u2019t sleeping well or enough.\n\nCaffeine is just making everything else much worse and it\u2019s accelerating the aging process!\n\nWhy We Like Caffeine So Much\n\nSo, why do you or anyone else even take caffeine products?\u2026\n\nYou can have \u201cdecaf\u201d coffee, tea or energy drinks. It tastes the same. So, it\u2019s not about \u201ctaste\u201d.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s simply because you like how the caffeine makes you FEEL. After all, it IS a drug!\n\nWe like the temporary extra energy levels \u2014 both physical and mental.\n\nAdditionally, caffeine temporarily increases dopamine levels slightly. Dopamine is known as the \u201cpleasure chemical\u201d. So, another reason caffeine makes us \u201chappy\u201d.\n\nHowever, after continued use (usually 7-10 days):\n\nyour adrenal glands become overworked,\n\ncortisol levels increase,\n\ndopamine receptors become desensitized\n\nand caffeine is NO LONGER making you \u201cenergized and happy\u201d\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s now just keeping you \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nMany times you have a mid-day \u201ccaffeine crash\u201d, which means MORE caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, etc.). Thus, why it\u2019s addictive.\n\nAnd when you get off, the opposite happens \u2014 you\u2019re super tired, anxious and depressed!\n\nNow that you know energy drinks and caffeine aren\u2019t good for your health\u2026 let\u2019s talk about better, safer and healthier alternatives\u2026\n\nHow To Increase Your Energy Levels & Feel Good, WITHOUT Caffeine!\n\nThe good news is that with the correct combination of natural ingredients, you\u2019ll get MANY MORE BENEFITS, without any of the negatives of caffeine.\n\nThat means NO withdrawals. NO addiction. NO crashes.\n\nWhen increasing your energy levels \u2013 you want to focus on BOTH physical and mental energy. This requires a balance of multiple mechanisms in your body.\n\nI\u2019m going to list how all of this can be done, naturally. And at the end of this article, I\u2019ll give a simple SHORT CUT solution \u2013 so I don\u2019t want you to feel overwhelmed.\n\nA common complaint among people, especially older adults is the loss of physical and mental energy. One primary reason is their cells\u2019 ability to produce energy is diminished. The two primary energy \u201cproducers\u201d in your body for your muscles, cells and brain are ATP and Mitochondria.\n\nYou can naturally increase these by taking Rhodiola Extract, NADH, CoQ10, PQQ and Acetyl-L-Carnitine.\n\nThis is a neurotransmitter that regulates your mood and cognition/memory. It\u2019s known as the anti-aging \u201cpleasure chemical\u201d. It gives you a natural \u201chigh\u201d. Sex and drugs like cocaine increase dopamine.\n\nYou can naturally increase dopamine by using wild green oat extract, velvet bean extracts and L-Theanine\n\nAs stated earlier, caffeine increases (NOT what you want) your stress hormones and depletes your adrenal glands, which leads to fatigue, weight gain and depression\u2026 in addition to many health problems.\n\nYou can naturally decrease stress hormones and improve your memory by taking Bacopa and Ashwagandha extract, Phosphatidylserine and Tyrosine.\n\nProper acetylcholine function is essential to muscle control, sleep, and cognition\u2026 and the prevention of mental problems. Additionally, increasing oxygen to your cells \u2013 both brain and muscle, will dramatically increase your energy levels and slow the aging process.13-16\n\nTo increase acetylcholine \u2013 you can take Alpha-GPC, Choline and Huperzine-A. And to improve oxygen to your cells, you should take Ginkgo Biloba and Vinpocetine.\n\nTotal Body & Brain Energy\n\nRemember, your goal is to increase your energy levels to BOTH your body (muscles) and brain (neurotransmitters), while reducing the aging process at the same time.\n\nI\u2019ve listed the four primary mechanisms, including the ingredients. You can read about the exact dosages as well, including clinical studies for additional proof.\n\nUnfortunately, the problem is that you have to buy too many different ingredients and supplements to achieve this \u201ctotal\u201d energy goal. It\u2019s not convenient and it can get very expensive.\n\nWhich is the same challenge I ran into for myself and private clients.\n\nMy Personal Favorite \u201cAll-In-One\u201d Solution\n\nHowever, I did finally discover an all-in-one solution.\n\nImagine getting all the benefits of caffeine and MORE, without the negative side effects, and as an added bonus, you\u2019ll look and feel younger too! \u2026\n\nPlus, all you did was just take 1 or 2 pills daily, which combined all these scientifically proven ingredients, along with a few other key ingredients\u2026\n\nMany years ago I was always tired because of too much work, school, responsibilities, stress, not sleeping enough, etc., etc. Something I\u2019m sure you can relate to.\n\nThen I found a great formula that gave my body and brain, more natural energy, all day long.\n\nAnd it improved my mental focus as well. Maybe you can benefit from it as well\u2026\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895706102031552\n\nhttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/esoc-clw082815.php\n\nhttp://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-may-cause-gout\n\nhttp://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/5/1015.short\n\nhttp://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/186223/reload=0;jsessionid=CzWm7s65jDRhoHPFzX4K.10\n\nhttp://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/8/2047.short#\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4206198/\n\nhttp://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/drug-facts/caffeine/\n\nhttp://www.statista.com/topics/1687/energy-drinks/\n\nhttp://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database\n\nhttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijvm/2010/834060/\n\nNitsch R, et al.

    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m going to reveal how you can sleep less, have more energy and live longer.\n\nI\u2019ll also give you 10 specific ways you can get a more restful sleep, in less time\u2026 giving you an extra hour or two of free time every day..\n\nMost of my life, I\u2019ve been a \u201cbad\u201d sleeper. I\u2019m super sensitive to sound and light. Any little thing can wake me up and when I\u2019m awake, I have a very hard time going back to sleep.\n\nMy brain is always \u201con\u201d \u2026\n\nI\u2019m either trying to figure out a solution to a problem \u2026 Or I\u2019m just excited about something. And I\u2019ve been like this my entire life. Luckily, I don\u2019t need much sleep.\n\nI Sleep 6 Hours Or Less\n\nIn fact, most of my life I\u2019ve only needed about 6 hours of sleep.\n\nAnd if I really optimized my nutrition, exercise, supplements and hormones, I needed even LESS sleep.\n\nAnd the thing is, I wake up feeling pretty good and energized. I\u2019ve never needed an alarm to wake up.\n\nAnd if I did get little tired in the middle of the day, I\u2019d take a quick 15-20 min nap and that\u2019s all I needed to be back to 100% energy.\n\nHowever, something in the back of my mind would keep saying \u201cthis isn\u2019t healthy, you *should* be sleeping at least 7-8 hours a day, or more!\u201d\n\nSo, I was always obsessed with sleeping more because I thought it was \u201cgood\u201d for me, even though I really never needed more sleep.\n\nI thought my lack of sleep was probably aging me more. However, the opposite might be true\u2026\n\nSleep More, Die Sooner\n\nResearch shows that people who sleep \u201cmore\u201d, actually die sooner than those who sleep less!\n\nRecently there was an analysis of 16 separate sleep studies covering more than 1.1 million people.\n\nWhat was discovered is that 30% of people who slept more than 8 hours a night, died earlier, than those who slept 6 hours.1\n\nAnd there have been other similar studies stating that sleeping 8 hours or more is worse for your health because of a variety of reasons \u2014 such as an\n\nincrease in inflammation\n\nnegative changes in hormones, etc.\n\n\u201cBut I NEED More Sleep Dr. Sam!\u201d\u2026\n\nOkay, great\u2026 so sleeping less might be good. And having an extra couple of hours in the day is even better.\n\nBut what do you do when you NEED more sleep? When you can\u2019t seem to function on only 6 hours? When you have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning?\n\nWell, Arnold Schwarzenegger jokes about this and says, \u201csleep faster\u201d.\n\nHowever, the real question is WHY do some people need more sleep than others? And how can you sleep less and have even more energy?\n\nHow To Sleep Less & Have More Energy\n\nWell, the real reason is that healthy people need less sleep.\n\nWhen your body is healthy, it\u2019s \u201cfixing\u201d everything in less time, you\u2019re more efficient and you have better QUALITY of sleep.\n\nUnless you\u2019re growing and you\u2019re below the age of 20, you don\u2019t need as much sleep.\n\nWhen you\u2019re NOT healthy, your body is slow to recover because your body is either lacking in nutrients or your hormones aren\u2019t optimized.\n\nYou\u2019re doing the wrong things \u2014 like\n\neating the wrong foods\n\ngoing to bed late and throwing off your circadian rhythm\n\nSo what you want to do is optimize your health, so you can repair and recover quicker at night and thus, get BETTER QUALITY of sleep.\n\n10 Proven Tips For Better Quality Sleep\n\nNow, there are lots of ways to do this and improve your \u201csleep hygiene\u201d. But let me give you the 10 tips that have made the biggest improvements in my sleep and energy levels.\n\nSo, let\u2019s first start with your sleeping habits as you get ready for bed.\n\nStop using all electronic devices, or at least dim the light on everything. I wear \u201cblue blocker\u201d glasses about 60 minutes before bed. Blue light keeps you awake.\n\nDon\u2019t take sleeping pills or drugs. You may sleep longer, but the quality is less. Not to mention they cause long-term memory loss and dementia. Instead, take magnesium and herbs that help you relax and maybe 1-3 mg of Melatonin. Too much melatonin makes you groggy in the morning.\n\nTry to get to bed by 10 pm and especially before midnight. This is when your hormones are optimized for sleep. Higher melatonin levels and lower cortisol.\n\nMake sure your room is dark and preferably around 68 degrees. Cooler helps you sleep better. I wear eyeshades and earplugs.\n\nBefore going to bed, journal or write down what you\u2019ve learned today and what you\u2019re grateful for. If you don\u2019t want to write it, at least think about it and FEEL it. Having a happy mindset allows for deeper and more restful sleep.\n\nWhen you get up in the morning, go have 2 big glasses of water and take a total-body energy solution called Body Brain Energy. This formula gives your mind and body the exact nutrients it needs to maximize your energy levels \u2013 physically and mentally.Body Brain Energy also helps improve cognition and optimizes your brain neurotransmitters, so you\u2019re productive AND happier the entire day.\n\nExercise daily, preferably earlier in the day. Most of us don\u2019t move enough or at all. Exercise also balances your hormones. You only need 20 min to start, even a fast walk is great.\n\nEat fewer processed animal proteins because they slow down your repair. Eat more vegetables, natural whole grains and healthy, raw fats for your brain.\n\nMake sure you get some sunlight daily to improve Vitamin D levels. We are indoors far too long and the sun helps optimizes your melatonin and cortisol levels for a deeper sleep at night.\n\nDon\u2019t obsess over your sleep. If you need more, sleep more. If you need less, sleep less. Every day your body has different stresses, so just go with the flow.\n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t wake up energized, you\u2019re not full of energy most of the day or your mind isn\u2019t sharp and your brain is foggy and your memory is getting worse. Then your body and your brain are lacking specific nutrients.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

Diet, exercise, controlling your thoughts, and other factors \u2026 all affect your hormones and neurotransmitters and thus, can turn genes on or off.\n\nI mention this because today I\u2019m going to reveal my 3 favorites, clinically proven herbs that will instantly increase your dopamine levels and thus, improve your energy, mood and desire.\n\nNow, many people know Dopamine as a \u201cfeel-good chemical\u201d.\n\nMore specifically, Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and cognition. Dopamine is involved in motivation, addiction, attention, lust, desire and happiness.\n\nIn fact, lots of \u201csinful\u201d actions such as sex, gambling, and drug use/addiction (alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.) all increase dopamine release.\n\nDopamine \u201cSensitivity\u201d\n\nBut the problem here is that as great as you feel with the increase in dopamine, the LESS sensitive your dopamine receptors become and thus, you need MORE \u201cstimulation\u201d to get the same \u201chappiness\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d.\n\nThus, one reason for \u201caddiction\u201d.\n\nAging = Less Dopamine\n\nUnfortunately, dopamine levels decline as we age resulting in decreased mental performance, depression, \u201cdrive\u201d, energy levels, happiness, and accelerated brain aging.6\n\nNow, one of the best ways to improve this is to take herbs that naturally increase both dopamine levels AND dopamine receptor sensitivity.\n\nWhen these 3 clinically proven herbs are combined in the correct dosage and extract, you\u2019ll have:\n\nelevated brain dopamine levels. 6,24\n\n74% improvement in mental acuity.6\n\n57% improvement in mental processing time and speed. 24\n\nincrease alpha-brain waves and electrical brain activity. 30\n\nimproved mood and better relaxation. 30\n\nMy Three Favorite Herbal Extracts\n\nVelvet Bean extract (Mucuna pruriens) (20% catecholamines; 15% L-dopa extract)\n\nL-DOPA is a precursor to the catecholamine (cat\u00b7e\u00b7chol\u00b7amine) neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. While L-DOPA can cross the blood-brain barrier, dopamine cannot, making L-DOPA the preferred compound to elevate brain dopamine levels.\n\nNeuravena\u00ae Wild Green Oat extract inhibits the monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) enzyme. This is important, because age-related decline in dopamine is largely caused by rising levels of MAO-B. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, there was a 74% improvement on a standard test of mental acuity 6 and 57% improvement in mental processing time and speed.\n\nNeuravena is the only clinically proven form of wild green oat extract shown to acutely improve attention and concentration as well as the ability to maintain task focus in older adults.34 It\u2019s also been proven to enhance cerebral vasodilation, which can help improve cognition and reduce the formation of plaque in the brain.34\n\nGreat tea extract has small amounts of an amino acid called L-Theanine. You\u2019ll need to drink a LOT of green tea to get the clinical benefits of L-Theanine, so that\u2019s why I just recommend taking L-Theanine by itself.\n\nNow, L-Theanine produces calming effects in the brain by increasing levels of serotonin and dopamine and blocking the binding of L-glutamic acid to glutamate receptors.25-31 This allows L-theanine to cross the blood-brain barrier and increase dopamine levels in your brain.\n\nThe calming, mood-enhancing effect is achieved by helping to increase alpha-brain waves, electrical brain activity commonly present when you are very relaxed, literally putting you in a better mood.30\n\nNow, even though you are relaxed, your energy levels are higher.\n\nAdditionally, It has anti-depressant and anti-anxiety effects, reduces mental and physical stress, and leads to improvements in learning and memory in humans and animals.[9,10]\n\nThe Best Combination That\u2019s Clinically Proven\n\nNow, I don\u2019t recommend you take each of these ingredients individually because it\u2019s time-consuming, not convenient, and becomes expensive over time.\n\nHowever, the good news is that if you want to increase your energy levels, mood, cognition, memory, and physical stamina by optimizing your youthful hormones and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, stress hormones, ATP, and mitochondria, I suggest using one of my favorite all-natural solutions called Body-Brain Energy.\n\nNow, I recommend Body-Brain Energy because it already combines these 3 ingredients with other, clinically proven ingredients\u2026. at the correct extract AND dosage amount.\n\nThis is what I personally use for myself, my family, clients, patients, and even my professional athletes.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nJ Altern Complement Med. 2011 Jul;17(7):635-7.\n\nUnpublished data on file.

History, phone numbers, addresses, birthdays, names, etc.\n\nBut, not me, my brother Henry or my mom.\n\n3 Clinically Proven Ingredients\n\nAnd that\u2019s why today I want to reveal 3 natural ingredients that are clinically proven to help improve your memory.\n\nAt the end of this short article, I\u2019ll also give you the same formula my family and clients have used for improving their memory and increasing their energy levels, naturally.\n\nImproving Acetylcholine Levels\n\nResearch has shown that a decline in acetylcholine levels coincides with advancing age and is a hallmark of neurodegeneration, which can lead to brain fog and memory loss. Proper acetylcholine function is essential to muscle control, sleep, and cognition.1\n\nThe best part is that by naturally increasing and improving your acetylcholine levels, you\u2019ll see and feel:\n\ncognitive-enhancing properties\n\nenhance growth hormone production2\n\noptimized cerebral (brain) energy metabolism\n\nAnd one of the fastest and easiest ways of doing this is by taking 3 natural ingredients:\n\nAlpha-GPC is a crucial building block for the production of acetylcholine in the brain. It has cognitive-enhancing properties and reduces the rate of cognitive decline in the elderly (especially for Alzheimer\u2019s disease).1 It also has the ability to enhance growth hormone production and power output, which helps increase muscle, decrease fat and slow down the aging process.2\n\nCDP-Choline stands for cytidine-5\u2019-diphosphate choline. This unique form of choline readily passes through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) directly into the brain tissue. Once past the blood-brain barrier, CDP-choline activates the synthesis of critical components in cell membranes, enhances cerebral/brain energy metabolism and increases levels of various neurotransmitters. This all results in improved cognition and memory.\n\nHuperzine A \u2013 is a standardized extract from the Chinese club moss is an all-natural herbal supplement that has been shown to maintain healthy levels of acetylcholine.3 It is known as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which means that it stops an enzyme from breaking down acetylcholine which results in increases in acetylcholine. Huperzine-A is in preliminary trials for usage in fighting Alzheimer\u2019s Disease as well.4\n\nNow, I don\u2019t recommend you take each of these ingredients individually because it\u2019s time-consuming, not convenient, and becomes expensive over time.\n\nHowever, the good news is that if you want to improve your memory, reduce your risk for neurodegenerative diseases \u2026 while also increasing energy levels, mood, cognition, and physical stamina by optimizing your youthful hormones and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, stress hormones, ATP, and mitochondria, I suggest using one of my favorite all-natural solutions called Body-Brain Energy.\n\nNow, I recommend Body-Brain Energy because it already combines these 3 ingredients with other, clinically proven ingredients\u2026. at the correct extract AND dosage amount.\n\nThis is what I personally use for myself, my family, clients, patients, and even my professional athletes.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy...

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/avoid-these-5-brain-damaging-fatigue-causing-neurotoxins-found-in-popular-foods/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today I want to discuss 5 brain-damaging neurotoxins that are found in very popular foods. Plus, I\u2019ll also give you healthy alternatives.\n\nAnd this is a really important topic for anyone who wants to increase your energy levels, improve your memory and cognition, your mood, and especially if you\u2019re concerned about brain and memory problems like I am due to my family history.\n\nAs a reminder, neurotoxins are substances that can harm your central nervous system (CNS).\n\nAnd your Central Nervous System (CNS) controls most functions of your body and mind. It\u2019s basically your brain and spinal cord.\n\nSimply stated, when these neurotoxins get into your body and \u201cattack\u201d your CNS, they negatively affect how you feel and function.\n\nAll of your senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, etc).\n\nYour organs and stomach.\n\nMuscle movements and strength.\n\nYour emotions, mood, memory, cognition, sleep, etc., etc.\n\nObviously, this is a really big deal.\n\nMore so, it\u2019s a massive problem because the FDA allows over allows 3,000 food additives to be used in our food supply and relatively few of them have been tested for safety.\n\nThey barely know what these additives do when used by themselves. And they most certainly do NOT know what they do when they\u2019re used together. There are just too many of them.\n\nUnfortunately, a handful of food additives are well-documented neurotoxins but are still found in popular foods most people eat daily, even in relatively healthy diets.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started.\n\nNeurotoxin #1: Aspartame Artificial Sweetener\n\nAspartame is a very popular artificial sweetener, especially about a decade ago. It\u2019s found in most things labeled \u201csugar-free\u201d or \u201cdiet\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s typically found in diet sodas, candies, chewing gum, and so forth.\n\nYou know, a lot of the stuff the kids eat, unfortunately.\n\nThe brand name is Equal or NutraSweet and sadly, I used to have a lot of this stuff over 20 years ago.\n\nThere are over 100+ reported side effects of aspartame including migraines, dizziness, anxiety, memory loss, insomnia, and the worsening of many disorders like fibromyalgia.\n\nIn fact, there were over 7,000 aspartame side effects reported to the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) between 1982 and 1995.\n\nYou can also find lists of reported side effects on various reputable websites including Cancer.org and CDC.gov.\n\nI\u2019m not saying everyone gets these side effects. And, the more you consume it, more often, the higher the dose and longer term \u2013 the more guaranteed problems.\n\nSo, make sure you read the label and avoid this artificial sweetener.\n\nIn fact, avoid them all except one of my favorites: Stevia \u2014 which is a natural, herbal extract.\n\nStevia has been used safely in Japan for a few decades before showing up in the US. It\u2019s 200 times sweeter than sugar and doesn\u2019t increase blood sugar or promote tooth decay.\n\nNeurotoxin #2: Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)\n\nThis basically acts like salt and it\u2019s found in many packaged foods you eat, also when eating out. The saltier the food, the higher the MSG.\n\nThey used to be heavily used in Chinese foods.\n\nMSG is very addictive and causes you to gain weight, but I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\nMany times MSG is found in foods like canned soups, salty snacks, ramen noodles, processed meats, and refined soy products.\n\nAlso in many \u201cspices\u201d, broths, and \u201cflavorings\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, the labels do NOT have to even say \u201cContains MSG\u201d.\n\nMany times, using the word \u201cnatural flavoring\u201d allows the use of MSG, without stating it on the label (thank you FDA!).\n\nHere are some label-listed ingredients that always contain MSG:\n\nhydrolyzed vegetable or plant protein\n\nplant protein extract\n\nMSG has many negative mental and physical side effects \u2014 however, one that most people don\u2019t know about is that it has a \u201cnegative nutrient partitioning\u201d effect.\n\nThis means that when you eat foods with MSG, the food converts much faster to BODY FAT than to be used as energy and muscle building.\n\nSo you can basically eat the same amount of calories but get fatter because of this artificial salt.\n\nPlus, it increases your appetite and has an addictive quality to it.\n\nThis is why food manufacturers put it into to so many of their \u201csnacking\u201d products. And, this is one reason it\u2019s so hard to stop eating a bag of chips or something similar.\n\nUnfortunately, all we can do is read the label and do our best to avoid packaged foods, especially those that I mentioned earlier.\n\nNeurotoxin #3: Diacetyl (In Popcorn)\n\nHome-popped, microwave popcorn contains butter \u201cflavoring\u201d, with an additive called diacetyl.\n\nYou won\u2019t see the word diacetyl on the label. But if you see \u201cartificial butter flavor\u201d or \u201cnatural flavors,\u201d assume that the product contains this neurotoxin.\n\nDiacetyl causes much harm to the brain by crossing a protective filter called the blood-brain barrier. You don\u2019t want this.\n\nSo the solution to eating popcorn is to just make it at home, using an air popper.\n\nNeurotoxin #4: Mercury\n\nIn recent years, I\u2019ve been much more concerned about mercury poisoning because I\u2019ve been eating more fish. I go out and eat sushi.\n\nUnfortunately, many fish have high levels of mercury due to environmental pollutants in the air and water.\n\nThis includes one of my favorite fish, TUNA \u2013 which I now avoid. You also want to avoid swordfish and orange roughy.\n\nMercury can also cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in your brain \u2013 which can cause \u201cmercury poisoning\u201d. The first signs of mercury toxicity include memory loss, mood swings, numbness, and tremors.\n\nFatty fish are low in mercury and the best are wild-caught Alaskan Salmon, herring, mackerel, and sardines. These fish are also highest in healthy, Omega 3 fats.\n\nNeurotoxin #5: Aluminum\n\nThe last neurotoxin you want to avoid is Aluminium because there are 50 years of proof that it can lead to memory loss.\n\nUnfortunately, aluminum is very common.\n\nIt\u2019s used as an additive in baking powder and anti-caking agents.\n\nHowever, the most common is found in your drinking water (tap), antacids, and deodorant (antiperspirant).\n\nSo, I suggest drinking filtered water and using regular deodorant, not antiperspirant.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also readily seen in aluminum foil, cans, and cookware.\n\nInstead, use cookie sheets, glass bottles, and containers.\n\nBottom Line & Summary\n\nNeurotoxins are chemicals known to be harmful to the brain directly and therefore, to your body, indirectly.\n\nThe end result is poor memory, cognitive problems, brain fog, poor sleep, mood disturbances, fatigue, and lots of brain and mental problems.\n\nThe more often and the higher the \u201cdose/consumption\u201d, the bigger the problem will be over time.\n\nAnd I actually bring this up mainly due to the fact that I have a family history on BOTH my parent\u2019s side of some of these problems.\n\nHeck, when I got into my 40s, my memory and energy started to get worse and now that I\u2019m in my 50\u2019s, this is a big worry for me \u2014 and, maybe something you\u2019re concerned about as well.\n\nIf you are looking for a natural solution for supporting healthy energy levels, healthy memory, and cognition, and helping reduce and even avoid \u201cbrain problems\u201d, I suggest you try a formula that I\u2019ve been using for over a decade to help with all of these issues.\n\nYou can feel the positive results immediately and over time, brain function and energy will continue to improve.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 now and people are smoking less these days, which is a good thing.\n\nHowever, there are still many people who smoke and want to stop, but they just don\u2019t know how or whatever they\u2019ve tried doesn\u2019t work. For example, I got the following email the other day.\n\n\u201cHey doc \u2013 I really need to stop smoking, but I\u2019m not sure how. I\u2019ve tried a few times, but it never works. My doctor told me I need to stop cold turkey. He also suggested I take the drug, Chantix. What are your thoughts? Please help me.\u201d\n\nIt Starts In The Head\n\nWell, first of all \u2013 your mindset has to be in the right place. You must WANT to stop. Coming from a place where you \u201cneed\u201d to stop, isn\u2019t very strong.\n\nMake a list of all the bad or negative things that will happen if you continue to smoke. Such as heart and lung problems, putting your family under stress, extra medical costs in the future, etc.\n\nThen, make a list of all the positive things that will happen. You\u2019ll feel better, have more energy, smell better, live longer, etc.\n\nThe more emotional, the better.\n\nAdditionally, you must also have good people around you. If all of your friends are smokers, you can\u2019t really go out, interact with them, and not feel that need or urge to smoke. So, keep this in mind.\n\nAs far as the Chantix, this is a nightmare of a drug.\n\nThis pill will make you 34 percent more likely to end up in the ER for an endless nightmare of dangerous heart problems including heart attack, stroke, arrhythmias, unstable angina, and peripheral vascular disease.\n\nIn real numbers, that means that nearly 1 in 250 patients on Chantix will suffer some kind of cardiovascular problem requiring a trip to the ER \u2014 not because they\u2019re smokers, but because of the drug.\n\nNow, some will say this is because smokers already have health problems. But, this isn\u2019t the case.\n\nIf you have no history of heart problems at all\u2026 not even a little chest flutter\u2026 Chantix will STILL increase your risk of an ER visit for a cardiac issue by 12 percent.\n\nThe drug also causes anger and rage and is also linked to suicides.\n\nSo, forget the drug\u2026 I\u2019ll show you how to do it naturally, in a minute.\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of people try to stop smoking cold turkey, but I don\u2019t like this method.\n\nNicotine, one of the active ingredients in cigarettes is extremely addictive. However, the thousand other chemicals in a cigarette are probably even MORE addictive.\n\nSo, just as with any addictive drug, I don\u2019t tell people to just stop. I tell everyone to cycle off.\n\nFor chemical reasons, but also habitual reasons.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been smoking for a few years, maybe 10 or 20 or more, this is now a daily habit of yours.\n\nCycle Off \u2013 It\u2019s Better & Safer\n\nSo, it\u2019s best to slowly cycle off of the drug, while your body balances itself out and improves different chemicals and neurotransmitters \u2013 which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute.\n\nNow, let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re smoking 10 cigarettes daily. Here\u2019s how to do it.\n\nGo to the lowest nicotine content cigarettes.\n\nLower by one cigarette every week. So week one, you go from 10 daily to 9 daily. Week two, 8 daily. Week 3, 7 daily and so forth.\n\nSo, in about 10 weeks, you\u2019re basically off of cigarettes. Chemically and physically \u2013 are BOTH two different mechanisms of addiction.\n\nImproving Chemicals & Neurotransmitters\n\nPart of the addiction that comes from smoking cigarettes is the euphoric feeling and chemical high.\n\nNicotine gives you more energy. It\u2019s a stimulant. It increases adrenaline.\n\nIt helps increase cognition and improves focus. In fact, nicotine is a very powerful nootropic.\n\nIt increases dopamine levels \u2013 which is the pressuring chemical. And this is a major issue with addiction.\n\nNicotine also decreases your appetite and interacts with your blood sugar and insulin receptors.\n\nSo, this is why it\u2019s so hard to just stop cold turkey. Too many positives to justify stopping.\n\nInstead, we need to fix all of these chemicals in your brain and body, naturally \u2013 so you get the same high or benefits all day long and it\u2019s NOT from the cigarettes.\n\nSo what we want to do is replenish naturally, what the nicotine was giving your body. And in the process, fix what the smoking broke.\n\nHerbs that will also:\n\nIncrease your energy levels\n\nImprove cognition and focus\n\nIncrease dopamine levels\n\nThus, you\u2019re getting all the same benefits, but now it\u2019s NOT from the cigarettes. It\u2019s from natural, safe herbs.\n\nWith that said, I\u2019ve got a link to the best herbs and formulas that will help accomplish these goals.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a formula that many people use to just have more energy \u2013 body, and mind.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve noticed that when smokers are trying to quit, using my cycle-off method combined with the ingredients listed below, they have almost NO withdrawal problems and mostly stay off the cigarettes, permanently!\n\nWe replace the negatives of smoking, with the positives of natural herbs.\n\nNow there\u2019s not a void.\n\nHowever, as stated originally \u2013 you must WANT to quit and you need to be around good people who will support and respect you.\n\nAnyway, if you want to stop smoking, permanently \u2013 cycle off slowly and replace the positives with natural herbs.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and the number one complaint I hear from people, especially as they\u2019ve gotten older, is that they\u2019re tired all the time.\n\nThey wake up tired, they\u2019re dragging at different times of the day, they\u2019re too tired to exercise or have a good workout, too tired for a variety of reasons.\n\nIronically, most of these people also don\u2019t sleep well. They either don\u2019t sleep enough or they don\u2019t have good quality sleep and thus, they need to sleep BETTER \u2013 not longer.\n\nAnd, these same people are all taking something with caffeine every day. This can be:\n\nCola (including diet)\n\nPre-workout supplements\n\nCaffeine is in so many products and is so common these days and used by almost everyone \u2013 including children drinking soda and teenagers drinking coffee \u2013 that nobody gives it a second thought.\n\nThis is why caffeine is the MOST used and abused drug on the planet\u2026. because people don\u2019t even think of it as a drug.\n\nBut it\u2019s so powerful that Coca Cola\u2019s original formula contained Cocaine (hence, the \u201cCoca\u201d in the name) and the replacement drug for the cocaine was and still is, caffeine.\n\nBy the way, the total caffeine mg dosage is usually NOT listed on the label of most products and many times, underdosed based on many studies. Thus, you\u2019re ingesting even more caffeine than you think.\n\nAnd this is bad because caffeine is linked to:\n\nAnxiety and panic attacks\n\nSleep disturbances and insomnia\n\nHigher stress hormones (cortisol, etc.) and lower testosterone levels\n\nNervousness and jitters\n\nIncreased blood pressure\n\nIncreased blood sugar\n\nHeartburn and indigestion\n\nAnd a few other problems\n\nAnd the truth is that caffeine DOES make you feel good, initially. It improves the pleasure chemical, Dopamine. Unfortunately, continued usage DECREASES the dopamine release AND sensitivity.\n\nThat\u2019s a DOUBLE negative.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be honest with you \u2013 I love caffeine and I used to have a lot of it to get me through the earlier days of me going to school and working full-time. But, I realized it started to cause a lot more harm than good.\n\nAnd yes, caffeine IS a drug and it IS addictive because it\u2019s very hard to just stop it, cold turkey. You feel like crap, you can\u2019t function well, you can\u2019t think clearly, you\u2019re very irritable, no energy, you have bad headaches, no sex drive, and other withdrawal side-effects.\n\nStimulants like caffeine, burn out your central nervous system (CNS) and exhaust your adrenal glands, which leads to hormonal imbalances.\n\nSo what does all of this mean for you?\n\nWell, if you take products containing caffeine, you should think about lowering the dosage and eventually getting off. You can instead use natural herbs, nootropics, and co-enzymes to increase your energy levels, mood, cognition, and so forth.\n\nAll GOOD for your body and brain.\n\nAnd below, I have two links I want you to visit.\n\nI made another article about this topic in more detail, entitled The Major Health Problem With Energy Drinks and Caffeine.\n\nI also have a link for a natural formula that I use myself, to improve my energy levels, focus, memory, and just feel happier and get a lot more work done.\n\nTake a look at one or both links and let me know how it works out for you.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today I\u2019m going to discuss how scientists have discovered that there\u2019s memory loss in 84.2% of people who are deficient in this ONE Vitamin.\n\nThe good news is that you can easily fix and help reverse this and I\u2019ll tell you how below.\n\nThis is obviously important if you\u2019re concerned about your memory at any age, especially if you\u2019re over the age of 40.\n\nIf you have a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia, as I do.\n\nOr you simply want to improve your memory, as we all do.\n\nSimply stated, a deficiency in vitamin B12 is linked to memory loss.\n\nSurprisingly, up to 25% of adults are deficient in B12.\n\nAnd about 50% of people do NOT have optimal levels of B12. Thus, they are \u201cnormal\u201d, but low.\n\nPeople over the age of 45 are more likely to be deficient.\n\nAnd by far the most prevalent group of people who are likely to be deficient are vegans, vegetarians, and those who have had gastric bypass surgery.\n\nWomen are more likely to be deficient than men, especially if you\u2019re menstruating.\n\nAnd research has shown that people who have memory loss, 84.2% of them were deficient in B12.\n\nThe good news is that this can easily be reversible by simply taking a B12 supplement or eating more foods that are high in B12.\n\nLastly, if you want to improve memory and focus, while ALSO increasing your physical energy \u2013 you can take an \u201call-in-one\u201d supplement called Body-Brain Energy \u2013 which is what I\u2019ve been taking for many years.\n\nVitamin B12 is naturally found in animal products, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and milk products.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019ve been listening to me for any length of time, you know that I suggest you do NOT eat dairy products\u2026 or at least limit them.\n\nI believe that milk is for babies and cow\u2019s milk is for baby cows.\n\nVitamin B12 is generally not present in plant foods\u2026 hence, the common deficiency in vegans and vegetarians.\n\nThe 3 foods that are highest in Vitamin B12 are:\n\nNow, most people are NOT eating clams or beef liver daily. Not even salmon\u2026 even though I personally do eat salmon 2-3x a week.\n\nSo, you can always take a B12 supplement.\n\nHow Much B12 Do I Need?\n\nStudies show that you need a minimum of about 5 MCG daily to not be deficient. That\u2019s not much.\n\nI think 20-30 MCG daily is a good starting dose.\n\nA good multivitamin should have it, even though most have incorrect ratios of other B vitamins, which can lead to imbalances.\n\nIf you do want to improve your memory and increase your physical energy, I highly recommend using Body Brain Energy, which is what I use myself.\n\nIt contains 30 MCG of B12 per serving, which is all you\u2019ll need to reverse any deficiency and have optimal levels and hence, improve your memory.\n\nIt also contains about 20 clinically researched ingredients for improving your physical energy, mental focus, and brain health.\n\nI just take 2 pills in the morning and the benefits last most of the day, but without it affecting my sleep.\n\nMore details about Body-Brain Energy in this link if you want to give it a try.\n\nIt comes with a one-year guarantee, so you have nothing to worry about or risk.\n\nRegardless of what you do, make sure you take care of your brain.\n\nGetting physically old is bad enough, without having to also worry about memory loss, brain fog, etc.\n\nAdd in some additional B12 in your diet, especially if you\u2019re a vegetarian or you eat very little red meat.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy...

    "content": "Genetics plays a role in everything. If you have a family history of memory problems, then you really need to make improvements in your life so you can avoid these issues or at least, delay them as long as possible.\n\nAnd today I\u2019ll give you 5 major causes of memory problems and simple solutions.\n\nAGING is a factor \u2013 because of the physical changes that happen to the brain, it can start to shrink. As well as hormonal changes and imbalances.\n\nSOLUTION: We can\u2019t stop aging, but we can slow down the negative effects of aging \u2013 lifestyle and attitude both are important. Try to schedule in some FUN time. Doing something youthful causes your brain and body to act youthful and thus, stay youthful.\n\nPOOR SLEEP is a major issue with memory, especially short-term memory. Older people typically don\u2019t sleep enough or don\u2019t have deep, quality sleep. Thus, the brain doesn\u2019t process, file away, and store that day\u2019s information and you have memory problems.\n\nSOLUTION: You need to prioritize your sleep. I\u2019ve got great solutions that are easy to implement and work quickly.\n\nSTRESS is a factor in everything due to the negative hormonal changes, poorer blood flow, and blood sugar levels. Having disempowering emotions such as anxiety, worry and depression reduce your ability to focus, and thus, memory is impaired.\n\nSOLUTION: You can\u2019t always control stressors in life, but you can control the MEANING of a stressful situation. Focus on the good, not the bad. I\u2019ve also spoken about this topic in the past and I\u2019ve got great solutions.\n\nDIET affects your brain health in many ways. High blood sugar is linked to memory problems\n\nAlso, not having enough healthy Omega 3 fats and on top of it, having too many omega 6 fats also causes your brain to not function optimally for a variety of reasons, one of the main ones being inflammation.\n\nSOLUTION: Decrease inflammation\n\nReduce cheap omega 6 seed and vegetable oils\n\nIncrease your omega 3 fish oils. Eat wild-caught salmon or take about 3000-5000 mg of fish oil, daily.\n\nTake various herbs, vitamins, and supplements.\n\nEXERCISE is an issue in that most people don\u2019t exercise enough or consistently. Not exercising the brain and learning new things causes your brain to slowly shrink and the pathways and neurons don\u2019t fire as well.\n\nSOLUTION: exercise your body and brain. That means resistance exercise for improving muscle mass and cardiovascular exercise for the heart, brain, and blood flow.\n\nLearn and do new things every day to exercise your brain. Do puzzles. Learn a new language or play an instrument.\n\nRegardless of your genetics or age, you can for sure improve your brain health and memory. However, you MUST take action, or else things will just get worse.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today you\u2019ll discover ONE specific nutrient that\u2019s VITAL for memory, muscle & faster metabolism. Sadly, most people are lacking it\u2026\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s essential for:\n\nhealthy brain development, function, memory, and cognition\n\nhealthy liver function\n\nTherefore, adequate amounts are needed for optimal health, fitness & longevity\u2026 especially if you\u2019re over the age of 35.\n\nDeficiency Is Very Unhealthy\n\nUnfortunately, many people have inadequate amounts of this nutrient and are actually deficient in it. Mainly because they don\u2019t eat the few specific foods that contain this essential nutrient.\n\nPeople who are especially at risk of deficiency are:\n\nAthletes \u2013 especially long-distance runners or anyone who works out 4-5 times a week.\n\nAlcohol Drinkers \u2013 yes, this includes those of you who drink wine\n\nWomen \u2013 especially pregnant and postmenopausal women\n\nI\u2019ve actually been taking this nutrient myself for over 25 years. I just take it in pill form. And in the past decade, I\u2019ve taken more advanced versions of it.\n\nOf course, by now you\u2019re thinking, \u201cOkay, what the heck is this super nutrient?\u201d\n\nBest Nutrient For Memory \u2013 What Is Choline?\n\nCholine is actually an essential nutrient \u2013 meaning you need it.\n\nFor example, there are essential amino acids \u2013 meaning, you need protein.\n\nThere are essential fatty acids \u2013 meaning, you need some specific forms of fat.\n\nIronically, there are no essential carbohydrates \u2013 but, that\u2019s another story for another day.\n\nEven though choline is a nutrient, it\u2019s neither a vitamin nor a mineral. However, many people or experts often group it with the B vitamin due to its similarities.\n\nHow Much Choline Do You Need For Better Memory?\n\nSince it\u2019s a nutrient, there is no RDA amount like there might be for certain vitamins and minerals.\n\nHowever, the Institute of Medicine has set a value for an adequate intake (AI) (6).\n\nThis value is intended to be sufficient for most healthy people, helping them avoid negative consequences of deficiency, such as liver damage.\n\nThe average adult needs about 500 mg daily. Pregnant women need to double that by about 1000 mg.\n\nRemember, this is so you don\u2019t get SICK or have health problems.\n\nI personally take double the dose at a minimum of 1000 mg daily and I take different forms of Choline, which I\u2019ll tell you about in a minute.\n\nTop 3 Food Sources For Choline\n\nThe good news is that you can get a decent amount of choline from foods. The 3 best ones being:\n\nBeef liver: 1 slice (2.4 ounces or 68 grams) contains 290 mg.\n\nChicken liver: 1 slice (2.4 ounces or 68 grams) contains 222 mg.\n\nEggs: 1 large egg contains 113 mg. It\u2019s found in the YOLK and ideally, the yolk should be runny, not hard-boiled.\n\nFresh cod: 3 ounces (85 grams) contain 248 mg.\n\nBut remember, you need to get at least 500 mg daily and I prefer 1000 mg for women, anyone who exercises regularly, and if you do anything that can stress your liver (alcohol, prescription drugs, etc.)\n\nNow, I typically eat 1 or 2 raw eggs, about 3-4x weekly. I put it in a protein shake. So, that\u2019s where I get my food source. I don\u2019t like liver and rarely eat cod.\n\nHowever, I still take different forms of Choline in supplements.\n\nBest Forms Of Choline Supplements\n\nNow, one of the reasons you take choline or need it is to help produce acetylcholine\u2026 especially since it declines as we age.\n\nSo, I take 3 main forms of choline:\n\nRegular Choline Bitartrate, which is the least absorbable form, but still has specific benefits and needs to be taken.\n\nAlpha-GPC [Alpha-Glyceryl Phosphoryl Choline (A-GPC)] is extremely well absorbed and crosses the blood-brain barrier. This has more energy, brain, memory, and cognitive benefits\n\nCiticoline (CDP-Choline)\n\nWhy do I take all 3? Because they work well together.\n\nI know you\u2019ll read online that one does this and the other does that and so on and so forth. But these 3 have an amazing synergy when combined together.\n\nI won\u2019t get into all the boring science and medical stuff \u2013 needless to say, the best nootropic, brain, and energy products will contain all 3.\n\nAnd the good news is that when combined together, you need a lower dose \u2013 so that\u2019ll save you time and money as well.\n\nMy favorite supplements contain the proper amounts, as well as other body and brain energy ingredients.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

Whether it\u2019s physically tired or maybe just mentally or emotionally burned out, which makes you feel tired.\n\nThe truth is that vitamins don\u2019t really give you energy. However, they DO help transform and convert the foods you eat, INTO energy that your cells and muscles can use.\n\nThe B vitamins are probably the most important ones when it comes to optimizing your energy levels.\n\nAnd many people are deficient in the B vitamins, especially B12, especially:\n\nPeople with Gastrointestinal (GI) problems\n\nThey\u2019re either deficient in the B vitamins or even more so, can\u2019t properly absorb them.\n\nThis is why when you take a B12 vitamin, you must make sure it\u2019s the METHYL version (as Methylcobalamin). This ensures that your body properly absorbs and converts the vitamin for proper use.\n\nWhat Do I Take For Energy?\n\nAfter years of trying different things, I\u2019ve kept it very simple these days to only TWO solutions.\n\nI first take a B-complex supplement every morning with a meal. I switch between two brands every other month:\n\nLife Extension\u2019s \u201cComplete B-Complex\u201d\n\nBoth companies are fine and have good ratios, dosages, and proper formulations.\n\nHowever, to guarantee extra energy all day long \u2013 both physically and mentally, I also use Body-Brain Energy \u2013 which does actually increase energy levels DIRECTLY.\n\nFirst, Body-Brain Energy already has the correct B12 form and dose.\n\nHowever, it also has almost 20 different nootropic and herbal extracts that all work together to optimize the different energy pathways in your body.\n\nSuch as Dopamine, ATP, Acetylcholine, Adrenal support, ATP, and Mitochondria \u2026\n\nAnd the best is that it contains no caffeine.

    "content": "When I was younger, I had a ton of energy.\n\nI didn\u2019t need much sleep and I got so much done during the day: school, work, gym, and social life.\n\nWith all of that extra energy, I was more motivated and just a lot happier.\n\nUnfortunately, the older we get, the more tired we typically become \u2013 physically AND mentally.\n\nOr, we\u2019re just not as motivated or driven as we used to be.\n\nWhich is just horrible because when you have lots of energy, both physical and mental energy, you enjoy so much more of life.\n\nYou live life with a lot more passion.\n\nYou get more work done, you can exercise more, you\u2019re more social, and you\u2019re just happier.\n\nHowever, when you feel drained, you don\u2019t want to do anything\u2026 other than just veg out and watch TV or scroll social media\n\nHeck, you can\u2019t even enjoy the weekends or vacation time if you\u2019re tired and dragging the entire time and all you want to do is just sleep.\n\nPart of it is due to aging and the negative changes in your hormones, brain chemicals, and neurotransmitters.\n\nHowever, the good news is that all of this can be reversed and greatly improved and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll reveal today \u2013 5 clinically proven ways to naturally boost your energy levels \u2013 physically and mentally.\n\n#5 is probably one of the most important ways and one that nobody ever even thinks about.\n\nSo make sure you read until the end because I\u2019ll also reveal a simple and proven formula for instantly increasing your energy levels within minutes naturally, and it\u2019ll last you most of the entire day.\n\nAs with everything, diet and exercise matter. So, let\u2019s start with your diet.\n\nYour body gets long-term energy from NUTRIENTS, not calories.\n\nThus, if you eat healthy, nutrient-dense natural, organic foods \u2013 such as live vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, your cells have fuel for the entire day.\n\nBut if you eat processed foods that are high in sugar and unhealthy fats, junky protein and carbs that shoot up your blood sugar, you\u2019ll constantly be having energy drops \u2013 physically, mentally, and emotionally.\n\nLastly, if you\u2019re trying to lose weight and you reduce your calories too much, too quickly, you\u2019ll also be tired and run down all the time.\n\nI\u2019m sure you already know all of this, but most people aren\u2019t doing it and I hope this is a reminder to eat better, nutrient-dense, natural foods.\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cA body in motion, stays in motion\u201d. And \u201cmotion creates emotion\u201d.\n\nInstead of trying to pump yourself up mentally to get energized, do it physically by moving more.\n\nUnfortunately, most of us are sitting around all day long. So, your body gets lethargic and tired.\n\nSo to get out of this rut, I suggest you take multiple walks during the day or do something to move more.\n\nMaybe go up a flight of stairs and come back down a few times during the day. Or go walk around the block a couple of times.\n\nBoth are simple, easy and can be done anywhere, any time.\n\nExercise and movement create and enhance positive hormones, chemicals, and neurotransmitters, which wake up your body and mind.\n\nI take a 10-15 min walk after 3 of my daily meals. I get energized and it helps me digest the food better.2\n\nIf you\u2019re sitting around all day at work or whatever, make sure you get up and move at least every 90 minutes. Preferably every hour.\n\nYou\u2019ll have more energy and you\u2019ll be a lot more productive.\n\nLastly, you really should exercise daily and the best time to do it is first thing in the morning, since the positive hormonal and chemical changes last most of the day and energize your entire day.\n\nHowever, if mornings don\u2019t work well for you, then do it whenever you can. Maybe at your lunch break or after work.\n\nEven a 20-minute workout \u2013 cardio and/or weights, will improve your hormones and also allow you to get deeper and better sleep.\n\nThe next thing you MUST do is get better, deeper sleep. And for most people, also just sleeping more.\n\nUnfortunately, most of these days we just don\u2019t sleep enough.\n\nWe work more, we have more stress, and there\u2019s a lot more \u201cstuff\u201d that keeps us late at night \u2013 such as electronic devices.\n\nNow, we all know we need to sleep more, but sleeping BETTER and more DEEPLY should be your priority.\n\nIt helps reboot your system and improve all of your hormones while minimizing stress hormones.\n\nI\u2019ll be doing an entire article series about getting deeper, better sleep.\n\nHowever, do your best to:\n\nGo to bed earlier, preferably by 10 pm or before midnight for sure. This works with your body\u2019s natural circadian and hormonal pathways. It also allows you a deeper sleep.\n\nTurn off electronic devices an hour before bed. Or at the very least, dim the lights around the house and on your electronic devices. The bright, blue light keeps you up and prevents deeper, REM sleep.\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize how valuable water is and thus, most people walk around dehydrated throughout the day and is a big cause of fatigue and brain fog.\n\nThis brings up the next way to increase your energy levels and that\u2019s by staying hydrated and drinking a lot more water.\n\nIn fact, I get up every 60-90 minutes and move around and typically go drink a 1-2 cups of water as well.\n\nDepending on your age and muscle mass, your body is made up of 55-75% water.1\n\nThe younger you are, the more water your body holds due to better hormones. And the more muscle you have, the more water your body holds.\n\nDehydration can affect your brain function, mood, and energy levels.3\n\nIf you exercise, dehydration also decreases strength, stamina, and endurance.\n\nDuring the day, you lose water through urine, sweat, and even breathing.\n\nSo in order to stay hydrated, you need to drink enough water to compensate for this loss.\n\nYou also have to decrease or eliminate things that cause dehydration such as anything with caffeine which causes a diuretic effect \u2013 this means you need to reduce or eliminate coffee, energy drinks, soda, etc.\n\nThis includes alcohol too.\n\nThus, you need to drink even MORE water if you don\u2019t want to eliminate caffeine or alcohol.\n\nSo, drink more water, especially when you\u2019re thirsty.\n\nUnfortunately, most people don\u2019t pay attention to thirst. And if they do, they\u2019ll have a couple of sips of water and think that\u2019s all they need.\n\nI suggest you drink half your body weight in oz. So, if you weigh 150 lbs, drink 75 oz. That\u2019s about 9 cups of water.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s too much, at the very least just do your best to add in at least 1 or 2 extra cups daily.\n\nReduce Stress & Negative People\n\nLastly, I want to talk about one of the biggest energy drains in your life \u2013 stress and negativity, especially people.\n\nStress causes many negative effects on the body\u2026 one of them being that it just sucks your energy levels \u2013 physically, emotionally and mentally.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not going to talk about all the typical things that cause stress \u2014 work, money, etc.\n\nInstead, I\u2019m going to discuss one of the biggest causes of \u201chidden\u201d stress and that\u2019s interacting with negative people or being consumed with negative thoughts and emotions.\n\nAnd you know who I\u2019m talking about.\n\nPeople who are never happy and always complain about everything.\n\nPeople who are judgmental and critical.\n\nPeople who always focus on what they do NOT have, instead of appreciating what they DO have.\n\nPeople who are always blaming everything and everyone else in life, instead of taking responsibility.\n\nWe all know these people just drain the life out of you and suck out your energy. Right?\u2026\n\nGuess what, if YOU do these things, you are also draining YOURSELF!\n\nBe mindful of this and these people.\n\nInteract with them less!\n\nAnd if YOU are negative, then you need to practice being grateful and appreciative,\u2026 because trust me, life can always be worse!\n\nSpend your time with positive people and do positive things that make you happy and energize you.\n\nRemember, people or situations are either taking from you or giving to you. Do more things that will bring you UP and FILL you up, rather than drain you.\n\nWhen you have more energy, you can do more and enjoy more of life.\n\nWhen you have energy, you feel, act, and even look younger.\n\nWhen you have energy, you can deal with stress much better and you\u2019re happier.\n\nI take a natural herbal energy pill every morning because it dramatically helps improve my body and brain energy levels.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple and scientifically researched formula that will instantly increase your energy levels physically and emotionally, while also promoting healthy memory and cognition.\n\nPlus, it has healthy anti-aging benefits.\n\nAnd the best part is that it works for young and old, men, and women.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3820066\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21736786",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/top-10-reasons-why-youre-tired-fatigued/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and more than ever, people are complaining about being tired & fatigued\u2026\n\nI remember when I got my puppy, she was just jumping around all day long. Like a little firecracker or popcorn. So much energy.\n\nBut as she\u2019s aged, she\u2019s calmed down a lot more. And I know in a few years, she\u2019s just going to be sleeping all day long.\n\nAnd I bring this up because I\u2019ll be honest with you, the older I get, the more tired and unmotivated I seem to get. At least, I\u2019m not as energized as I was in my 20\u2019s\n\nAnd this seems to be one of the biggest complaints I hear from most of my clients and subscribers. Men and women, and even younger people.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re feeling tired, you\u2019re not alone and today I\u2019m going to list the top 10 causes of fatigue \u2013 both physical and mental.\n\nOf course, I\u2019ll list solutions for each one as well.\n\nNow, to get started, I want to remind you that you need 3 things to live.\n\nOxygen or you\u2019ll die in minutes.\n\nWater or you\u2019ll day in days.\n\nFood and nutrients, or you\u2019ll die in weeks.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Oxygen.\n\nLack Of Oxygen Due To Poor Breathing\n\nMost people are shallow breathers. They don\u2019t take in enough oxygen and thus, it causes fatigue.\n\nThis is one reason why exercise is so important for improving your energy levels, you are breathing heavily, taking in more oxygen and thus, more energy to your brain, muscles and body.\n\nSo, learn to breathe deeply. Try to take deep breaths a few times every hour, especially when you\u2019re under extra stress.\n\nIn fact, one of the reasons you yawn is that your body is trying to take in more oxygen.\n\nIf you start taking in deep breaths and fast exhales, you\u2019ll get energized.\n\nI\u2019ll do another video specially for this in the future. So make sure you\u2019re following my blog regularly.\n\nNow we move on to water and the lack of hydration. Most people are dehydrated.\n\nMost people do not drink enough water.\n\nMost people drink liquids that actually cause dehydration, such as caffeinated drinks and juices.\n\nNothing is going to replace what water does.\n\nSo, start drinking more water, especially first thing in the morning.\n\nI\u2019ve made a video specifically about this topic.\n\nYour diet significantly affects the way you feel and most people don\u2019t eat a properly balanced healthy diet.\n\nYour body gets and maintains energy for the nutrients found in proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.\n\nUnfortunately, most people don\u2019t eat enough proteins. They eat too many simple and processed carbohydrates. And they lack essential fats.\n\nSo, even if you eat a lot of food, but are not eating enough nutrient-dense foods and balanced proteins, carbs and fats \u2013 you\u2019re body will feel deprived.\n\nYou\u2019ll be hungry, even though you\u2019re eating a lot of calories. You\u2019ll be tired, both physically and even more so, mentally.\n\nYour body is hungry for nutrients, not more calories.\n\nSomething interesting to know is that your brain is small compared to your body and yet, it consumes 25% of your energy.\n\nA lack of nutrients also means a lack of vitamins and minerals.\n\nMany people are deficient in Vitamin D and K. I would also add in a good B-complex vitamin and about 500-1500 mg of Vitamin C. I\u2019d also add in at least 400-800 mg of magnesium glycinate at night.\n\nThese vitamins and minerals are especially important as we get older, when we\u2019re under extra stress, exercising, and not getting enough sleep.\n\nStress is a normal part of life. However, chronic stress is linked to fatigue. And unfortunately, most of us have extra stress these days, even though we live lives of convenience and technology doing things for us.\n\nThe problem with stress is all the negative hormonal changes it\u2019ll cause\u2026\n\nFor example, an increase in cortisol levels. This causes a decrease in sex hormones \u2013 such as testosterone and estrogen.\n\nYour adrenal glands get negatively affected as well. This will reduce other hormones such as DHEA, pregnenolone, and others.\n\nStress causes an increase in blood sugar and blood pressure.\n\nStress causes poor sleep, which then leads to dozens of other problems, fatigue being one of the major ones.\n\nStress also causes inflammation, which further causes more fatigue and I\u2019ll talk about this in a minute.\n\nOf course, stress also causes an emotional drain.\n\nI\u2019ve made videos about the best ways to reduce stress.\n\nHormonal & Neurotransmitter Imbalances\n\nAs I just mentioned, stress causes negative hormonal changes, which cause you to age.\n\nStress dramatically reduces all of your \u201cyouth\u201d hormones, while increasing your \u201caging\u201d hormones.\n\nAdditionally, stress decreases neurotransmitters as well and causes imbalances in dopamine and serotonin.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just stress, but also just aging and unhealthy lifestyle cause hormonal imbalances.\n\nNever forget that hormones are very powerful. They control how you look and feel.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, taking Vitamin D is so important and that\u2019s because Vitamin D is not really a vitamin, but technically a hormone.\n\nConsuming Too Many Stimulants (Caffeine, etc.)\n\nWhat do most people do when they are tired? Yup\u2026 they take stimulants.\n\nThe most common one is anything with caffeine, such as coffee or these days, energy drinks and pills.\n\nCaffeine does give you a boost of energy. However, regular and daily use of caffeine causes your adrenal and adrenergic receptors to not work as well and thus, leads to more fatigue over time.\n\nIn fact, this is one reason why you have to keep increasing your caffeine intake and dose to continue to get energized.\n\nNot to mention, caffeine causes sleep problems. In both duration and quality of sleep.\n\nSo, even if you say you can take caffeine and sleep at night, sleep quality suffers. You do not get into deep REM sleep.\n\nThere are other ways to increase your energy levels without the use of caffeine or stimulants, which won\u2019t affect your sleep. And at the same time, will improve your focus and are actually good for your brain.\n\nI use a product called Body-Brain Energy. It\u2019s a nootropic that also contains specific herbs and vitamins.\n\nBeing Out Of Shape and/or Overweight\n\nSomething interesting happens on the days I don\u2019t work out \u2013 I\u2019m a bit tired. And if I don\u2019t work out for 2-3 days, I\u2019m just dragging all the time. I feel older and slower. Mentally I\u2019m not as sharp either.\n\nI mention this because being out of shape, not exercising, and especially being overweight, is definitely a risk of chronic fatigue and it\u2019s been clinically proven.\n\nPlus, being out of shape or overweight also causes hormonal imbalances, high blood pressure, blood sugar, inflammation and on and on.\n\nALL are major risk factors for illnesses and fatigue.\n\nThe more out of shape you are, the less you want to move. The less you move, the more out of shape you become.\n\nIt\u2019s a very negative circle of events.\n\nI discovered a few years ago how bad inflammation is for the body. At first, I knew it was bad for pain \u2013 such as joint and muscle pain.\n\nThen, I discovered how inflammation is bad for the brain\u2026 Then the organs\u2026 Then the negative impact on hormones and neurotransmitters.\n\nLittle by little, I discovered that chronic inflammation is bad for every aspect of your health. From head to toe, inside and out.\n\nAnd all of this inflammation causes fatigue.\n\nIn fact, the older we get, the higher the inflammation. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of the term, inflammaging\u201d\n\nAnd get what else happens as we get older, we get more tired.\n\nSo you need to reduce your inflammation and I\u2019ve have special links on how to do this, naturally.\n\nPoor Blood Circulation\n\nDo you know what else inflammation causes?\u2026 poor blood flow and circulation.\n\nIn fact, most of the fatigue-causing problems I\u2019ve mentioned today, all contribute to poor blood flow circulation.\n\nRemember, your blood contains all the youth hormones, nutrients, and oxygen to all of your cells, organs, muscles, and brain.\n\nSo you need to improve your circulation. I\u2019ve also made many videos about this topic.\n\nFinally, we come to the last one and probably the most important \u2013 I think the lack of sleep is the #1 cause of fatigue.\n\nMost of us, including myself, don\u2019t get enough sleep. Or at the very least, proper, deep, restful, and restorative sleep.\n\nMost people, when they get tired in the evening\u2026 instead of going to sleep, fight through it.\n\nThey keep watching TV, or on some electronic device or working or whatever else to keep themselves busy.\n\nAnd next thing you know, they get that \u201csecond wind\u201d and they wake back up instead of going to sleep.\n\nWell, this \u201csecond wind\u201d is bad \u2013 it\u2019s actually an increase in stress hormones such as cortisol and a drop in the sleep hormone, melatonin.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of what you want.\n\nSo, eventually, people go to bed late and get up too early with an alarm clock. Rarely do people just wake up naturally.\n\nYou end up losing an hour or two or more of sleep here and there. Next thing you know, at the end of the week, you\u2019ve probably lost 8 hours of sleep. That\u2019s like not sleeping one night.\n\nRemember, when you sleep, your body basically fixes everything from the day. For both your brain and body.\n\nSleep improves all of your hormones. It allows your brain to digest all of the day\u2019s information and store it properly.\n\nWell, I can go on and on with all the benefits and the importance of sleep.\n\nJust know that you can eat poorly, not exercise, take drugs, and be stressed out for years and you\u2019ll still be okay.\n\nBut just 1 or 2 nights of sleep deprivation causes massive destruction and aging in your body.\n\nPoor sleep kills your youth hormones and increases your aging hormones.\n\nRemember earlier I said how bad stress is for you. Well, one of the best ways to reduce stress is to get proper sleep.\n\nAnd the lack of sleep just adds to more stress.\n\nMake sleep a priority and this starts with proper sleep hygiene.\n\nI\u2019ve made many videos about this topic and the best resources for improving your sleep.\n\n\u2026 When you\u2019re tired, you don\u2019t get the most out of life or your relationships.\n\nWhen you\u2019re energized, you\u2019re happier, you treat people better, you\u2019ll work harder, you\u2019ll make more money, you\u2019ll make better decisions and well, the list of benefits goes on and on.\n\nPlease make improvements to what I\u2019ve mentioned today and take a look at all the resources I\u2019ve mentioned in today\u2019s video.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "I think one of the worst parts about getting older is having less energy, waking up tired, and feeling \u201cblah\u201d most of the day.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get anything done \u2013 work, gym, family time (kids), running errands, etc.\n\nYou can\u2019t even enjoy your free time when you\u2019re just exhausted all the time and don\u2019t want to do anything other than sleep or just watch TV the entire time.\n\nNow, add in memory problems, forgetfulness, brain fog, and feeling unmotivated all the time and now you really feel old.\n\nAnd because of the lack of nutrients in our diet and extra stressful lifestyles, people are feeling \u201cold\u201d in their 30s and 40s, more so later in life.\n\nProblem With Caffeine\n\nI think this is why so many people are addicted to caffeine products. You need that cup of coffee, soda, or some energy drink just to get you to feel NORMAL.\n\nUnfortunately, anything with caffeine increases your stress hormone cortisol, causes adrenal fatigue, lowers your thyroid production (thus, slowing your metabolism) and decreases your testosterone.\n\n6 Anti-Aging \u201cEnergy Boosters\u201d\n\nToday I\u2019m going to give you a quick summary of 6 anti-aging, \u201cenergy pathways\u201d that will increase your physical energy and improve your memory plus, help you look and feel younger at the same time.\n\nAs an added bonus, you\u2019ll be more motivated, driven, and happier.\n\nNo caffeine, no jitters, no crashes. All-natural ways.\n\nDecrease Stress \u2013 Stress disrupts multiple biochemical pathways, including cortisol production (a primary stress hormone), adrenal production (a primary cause of fatigue), pro-inflammatory enzyme production (a primary cause of disease) and neurotransmitter production (a primary cause of brain aging).1,2,3\n\nIncrease Dopamine \u2013 This neurotransmitter is known as the anti-aging, \u201cpleasure chemical.\u201d\n\nImprove Mitochondria \u2013 one of the most important metrics of whole-body health. It\u2019s found highest in your muscles, including your heart.\n\nBoost ATP \u2013 Similar to mitochondria, it is essential for survival.\n\nIncrease Acetylcholine \u2013 Low levels lead to memory loss\n\nImprove Oxygen Uptake & Circulation \u2013 Both decrease in aging, leading to muscle and memory loss.\n\nThe Problem With Aging\n\nUnfortunately, even if everything in your life is perfect, all of these 6 energy pathways decrease as you get older because of the negative changes in your hormones.\n\nNow, there are 4 ways to make improvements to all of these factors:\n\nDIET \u2013 what you eat/drink and don\u2019t eat/drink.\n\nEXERCISE \u2013 what kind, how often, duration and intensity.\n\nNUTRIENTS \u2013 This includes specific vitamins, herbs, plant extracts and amino acids.\n\nSTRESS MANAGEMENT \u2013 this has to do with your mindset and it\u2019s probably the MOST important factor, least understood and HARDEST to control.\n\nI\u2019ll be digging deeper into these 6 factors in future articles.\n\nHowever, if you want to improve these 6 \u201canti-aging\u201d energy-boosting pathways quickly and easily, you can simply take natural vitamins & herbs.\n\nI know how life can get busy (work, family, etc.) and sometimes we need a boost in physical and mental energy NOW, rather than in a few weeks.\n\nThe right supplements can help and get you motivated again.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy...

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and having better memory and more energy is something we all want or should want, at any age. Why?\u2026\n\nAs with any goal you have, the better your memory, and the more energy you have, the faster and more easily you\u2019ll achieve your goals.\n\nWhether it\u2019s to make more money, or you\u2019re in school, or you play sports, or in relationships, and of course, the older we get, the more important memory and energy become.\n\nPeople who succeed in life more than others, almost always are more energetic, driven, and passionate.\n\nThis is the same with athletes.\n\nMichael Jordan was known to require very little sleep and was always on the go. He played hard and also partied hard.\n\nSame with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nHe worked out 3-4 hours daily, had a job, was going to school, had real estate businesses, and that same memory and energy allowed him to succeed in bodybuilding, acting, and politics.\n\nAlso, great leaders are great readers. Successful people consume lots of information all day long and they can do so because they have good memories.\n\nBill Gates, Warren Buffet, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and others have all stated that they read a lot and have lots of energy.\n\nNo energy and poor brain function = Little success!\n\nAt the very least, it\u2019s a lot harder, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to quickly talk about the best foods, diet, and ingredients for improving your memory and energy levels, at any age.\n\nIf this is a topic that you\u2019re really interested and would like more details on, make sure to check my blog regularly.\n\nPlus, I\u2019ve got some exclusive content for my private members that you can get access to for free. More details about that at the end of the article.\n\nLet\u2019s keep things simple with this memory diet.\n\nIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve done a lot of research about since I have a family history of memory loss.\n\nAnd in all honesty, my memory has never been very good. My mom is the same way.\n\nYet, my dad has an awesome memory. But HIS mother (my grandmother) had severe memory loss the last decade of her life.\n\nSo, it\u2019s a 50/50 problem for me.\n\nThe diet breakdown is about\n\nSo, it\u2019s more of an isocaloric diet, with almost the same amount of calories from each of the 3 macronutrients.\n\nNow we need to fill in the categories with the best foods.\n\nYou want to mostly eat:\n\nExtra virgin olive oil\n\nSmall amounts of MCT Oil in the form of C8, Caprylic Acid\n\nI would recommend you eat whole foods, over oils. There are more nutrients and it digests and absorbs better.\n\nFor example, Olives over Olive oil.\n\nYou must stay away from trans and hydrogenated fats and most seed and vegetable oils that are high in omega-6 fats.\n\nThese are the cheap supermarket oils such as soybean, corn, sunflower, and so forth. These are typically found in packaged foods.\n\nYou want to eat more fish but stay away from those high in mercury such as tuna. So I suggest wild-caught salmon.\n\nPasture-raised chicken and turkey.\n\nSmall amounts of grass-fed bison\n\nAnd more vegetable protein sources such as non-GMO rice and hemp protein.\n\nFinally our favorite tasting foods.\n\nYou want to eat lots of vegetables \u2013 especially spinach, seaweed, and Brussels sprouts.\n\nEat fruits, especially berries.\n\nGet colorful with your fruits and vegetables\n\nLegumes are great, especially lentils. Pressure cook them or soak them for a day to remove inflammatory lectins.\n\nYams are fantastic and small amounts of white rice and not brown.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to ask \u201cWhy not brown\u201d, I\u2019ve already done an article about this topic, so read about it here.\n\nEzekiel bread is also good.\n\nYou want lower glycemic foods because high blood sugar is linked to memory issues.\n\nFinally, we have supplements.\n\nPersonally, I think most supplements are worthless because they are poorly formulated with the wrong ingredients, wrong doses, and wrong combinations.\n\nHowever, there are specific supplements \u2014 herbs and amino acids that are clinically proven to help improve memory, blood flow to the brain, more oxygen to your cells, and increase energy throughout your entire body.\n\nSome of the best ones are:\n\nThings that improve mitochondria \u2013 such as CoQ10, PQQ and Acetyl L Carnitine\n\nIncrease oxygen and brain circulation \u2013 such as Ginkgo, Green Tea Extract and Vinpocetine\n\nATP for more cellular energy \u2013 Rhodiola Extract and NADH\n\nDifferent forms of Choline, which are essential for the brain, are found in whole eggs.\n\nNootropics such as Bacopa extract.\n\nIncrease Dopamine, which helps with memory, mood, Parkinson\u2019s and other brain issues \u2013 the best is green oat extract, Velvet Bean, and L-Theanine.\n\nFinally, ingredients that reduce stress hormones such as cortisol \u2013 this would be Phosphatidylserine, Ashwagandha, and Tyrosine.\n\nNow, I know I just listed a bunch of ingredients.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to take each of these individually.\n\nI used to do so, but it\u2019s inconvenient and very expensive.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a fantastic product called Body-Brain Energy that contains all of these ingredients and a few others.\n\nIt\u2019s what I personally take and have done so for almost 20 years.\n\nIt comes with a one-year guarantee, so you have nothing to worry about or risk.\n\nNo matter what you want to achieve in life, any goal you have \u2013 you\u2019ll achieve it much faster, with less effort and you\u2019ll have a lot more fun\u2026 if you have more energy and better brain function and memory.\n\nKeep your diet as natural as possible.\n\nEat fats, carbs, and proteins. Healthy fats are especially important for brain health, as is proper and stable blood sugar levels.\n\nMore importantly, limit junk such as processed foods, sugars, alcohol, drugs, and similar toxins.\n\nOf course, all of this is easier said than done.\n\nSo start slowly with the improvements I suggest today.\n\nAnd make sure you add in the ingredients I mentioned earlier to speed up the process.\n\nBy taking a proven supplement such as Body-Brain Energy, you\u2019ll heal your brain, improve your memory, have more energy, and you don\u2019t have to be AS strict with your diet.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/6-best-foods-herbs-for-healthy-blood-pressure-levels/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to give you 6 specific foods and herbs that are clinically researched to promote healthy blood pressure levels. No drugs. No side-effects.\n\nAs you may or may not know, having healthy blood pressure levels is super important for your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nThis is because high blood pressure negatively affects:\n\nYour organs, especially kidneys and liver\n\nHeart and brain, which can cause a heart attack or stroke\n\nEnergy levels, more fatigue, harder to breathe, etc.\n\nSleep \u2013 negatively affects all of your hormones.\n\nMuscles, including sexual performance.\n\nThe bad part about all of this is that the older we get, the higher the blood pressure and the weaker the kidneys.\n\nIt\u2019s just a part of aging.\n\nAnd remember, your kidneys don\u2019t regenerate like your liver.\n\nMost of the time, the kidneys only get weaker and high blood pressure accelerates the process dramatically\n\nIn fact, high blood pressure is such a major problem that there are over 2 dozen different drugs specific for hypertension.\n\nAnd if all of this wasn\u2019t bad enough, the majority of people don\u2019t even know they have high blood pressure.\n\nAnd I say this from the personal experience of both my parents and even myself over the past few years.\n\nThis is why I wanted to share with you what I\u2019ve learned has worked, natural solutions \u2013 foods and herbs, instead of toxic drugs.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started with the best foods and herbs.\n\nThe specific polyphenols in grapes, red grapes, and more specifically in the seeds are very powerful. This is one minor reason why red wine can help lower blood pressure levels.\n\nUnfortunately, to get the benefits, you\u2019d have to drink a LOT of red wine, or grape juice daily. And that\u2019s a lot of sugar and calories.\n\nHowever, an herbal form of Grape Seed Extract is far more powerful and potent than the actual food, and without any sugar or calories. Take 400 mg at 95% extract.\n\nExtra virgin olive oil and regular olives have lots of health benefits. Again, similar to the grapes, it\u2019s the polyphenols in olives that work the blood pressure-lowering magic.\n\nHowever, scientists have discovered that a primary benefit of olive oil is a compound called Oleuropein. These days, you can take this compound in the herbal form of Olive Leaf Extract at 20% Oleuropein.\n\nIt\u2019s actually far more potent than olives or olive oil for promoting healthy blood pressure and it has NO calories. Take 400 mg at 20% Oleuropein extract\n\nCelery is a very low-calorie vegetable. It\u2019s simple food, with a complex chemical makeup.\n\nOne of the chemicals in celery is 3nB, which helps promote healthy blood pressure levels at 100 mg daily.\n\nThe problem is that to get that dose, you\u2019d have to eat at least 530 stalks of celery. That\u2019s nearly 50 lbs! Which we all know, nobody will do.\n\nHowever, the good news is that you can simply take Celery Seed Extract and get all the blood pressure-supporting benefits, without having to eat 50 lbs of celery every day.\n\nTake 200 mg at 40% extract.\n\nI really love the taste of pomegranates, even though they are not very popular or available in the US.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of pomegranate is that it helps promote healthy blood pressure and also increases nitric oxide levels and thus, promotes healthy circulation.\n\nThe problem is that pomegranates are expensive and hard to find. The juice is just full of sugar and extra calories.\n\nHowever, you can take pomegranate extract in a pill. 200 mg daily at 40% extract, which is the equivalent of 6 large pomegranates.\n\nThere\u2019s a substance in tomatoes, especially the seeds, that has many health benefits, especially for blood pressure and it\u2019s called Lycopene.\n\nUnfortunately, to get the optimal blood pressure benefits, you\u2019d have to eat at least 3 lbs of tomatoes daily, including the seeds.\n\nAlternatively, you can simply take the pill form of lycopene at 5% extract. All you need is 30 mg\n\nBerries have lots of health benefits. Black and blueberries especially. One specific berry, called Hawthorn, is especially important for promoting healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nAnd this is because of the specific flavonoids that act as powerful antioxidants and help promote healthy inflammation and arterial dilation.\n\nThe only real problem with Hawthorn berries is that they are hard to find and when you do, they are super expensive. If you can get them and can afford them, have them daily.\n\nOtherwise, you can get all the benefits by taking Hawthorn berry extract at 400 mg daily.\n\nAs much as I love eating the foods I mentioned today, it can get expensive to eat them. Not to mention all the extra calories.\n\nThis is why I also mentioned the herbal extract alternatives because if you\u2019re like me, you want to save time and money.\n\nThe only problem here is having to buy all of these herbs separately, at the correct dose and extract. This is the same problem I ran into with my parents and their high blood pressure.\n\nThe good news is that there is an all-in-one formula that has all of these 6 key herbal food extracts in ONE convenient pill.\n\nIt\u2019s called Blood Pressure Optimizer. It\u2019s what my parents and I have been taking for over 18+ years.\n\nIt works so well that it comes with a one-year guarantee.\n\nSo if you want something natural, proven, easy, and convenient, give Blood Pressure Optimizer a try and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "If you need to drag your carcass out of bed every morning for work or to deal with the kids, then you\u2019re likely very good friends with your coffee pot. You might be placing bulk orders for energy drinks to help get past the morning wall you face before lunch too. The problem with higher levels of caffeine is that it can create a condition known as adrenal fatigue. You can actually become reliant on the caffeine to get moving! That\u2019s why ashwagandha is such a beneficial herb to have on hand.\n\nAshwagandha comes from the family of plants that includes the tomato and it even bears red fruits like a tomato plant, except they only get to be about the size of a raisin. It is grown anywhere there is a mild climate and is chock full of fatty and amino acids, alkaloids, choline, and some sugars. That, however, is just the start of what this herb can provide people.\n\nYou Get Natural Energy Without the Crash\n\nAshwagandha is an essential herb that does an excellent job of reducing the effects of stress on the human body. It helps to stabilize a person\u2019s metabolism and keep their blood sugar levels regulated so that instead of spikes and crashes like you\u2019d get with caffeine, you get a nice, consistent buzz of energy that lasts for a longer period of time.\n\nThe benefits of ashwagandha don\u2019t just stop at providing consistent levels of energy. With over 200 clinical studies on this herb providing proven results, there are also these benefits that can make an appearance with regular use. Many people report experiencing:\n\nProtection of their immune system\n\nA lowering bad cholesterol levels\n\nA reduction of degeneration in brain cells\n\nAnti-inflammatory benefits\n\nIn some regions of the world, ashwagandha is even used to treat malaria because of its antiseptic properties. If you\u2019re looking for a way to be more stable throughout the day, in both mood and in overall metabolic health, this herb holds a lot of potential! It really can help you fight off adrenal fatigue, one day at a time.\n\nHow Can You Take Ashwagandha?\n\nThe typical dosage of ashwagandha is 1000mg which is taken twice daily. It is often taken in the form of a supplement, but it can be made into a tea that can create calming conditions within the body. When taken with warm milk, ashwagandha has been known to help with insomnia and anxiety. For the most part, all of these benefits come without side effects.\n\nThe only exception is if you are pregnant. In large doses, research has shown that this herb may cause spontaneous abortions, so ashwagandha is not recommended during pregnancy. Otherwise, this herb that has been part of medicinal remedies in the Asia-Pacific region for up to 2,000 years could provide you with the energy you need to fight off adrenal fatigue to become healthier and happier once again.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/7-natural-herbs-and-vitamins-that-increase-energy/",
    "content": "Do you crave that morning cup of coffee as soon as the alarm goes off? Are you always tired at your desk when working, trying to just make it through the day? Would you like to be able to have the energy to make it through your day without having to rob your body of needed nutrients in order to do it? There are a number of natural herbs and vitamins that you can include in your daily routines that will help you easily accomplish this goal.\n\nPrimary Causes of Feeling Tired\n\nOne of the main reasons why people feel tired every day isn\u2019t because of a lack of sleep. It\u2019s actually because humanity today is surrounded by so much information that the brain can\u2019t keep up with everything! People today get more information from logging onto the internet to access their RSS feeds than they did in a year\u2019s worth of newspapers just a century ago. Think about how much mental effort it takes to truly absorb the data you encounter. Now multiply that effect as you go about your day and it\u2019s easy to see why so many people hit the wall in the afternoon.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to fight fatigue if you\u2019ve got these natural herbs and vitamins working for you. You\u2019ll be able to boost your energy instantly, retain your mental focus, and even enhance your motivation to get a job done quickly. So what are the natural vitamins and herbs that can help you get the energy back you need right now?\n\n7 Ways to Increase Energy\n\n1. Ashwagandha One of the most difficult herbs to pronounce is also one of the most effective natural herbs to help increase your energy levels. It works to lessen the stresses that affect your nervous system every day, which means your body will actually produce less adrenaline when this herb is taken consistently. This gives you a better overall energy reserve that you can tap into to fight fatigue. It will also stabilize blood sugars and stabilize mental processes, both of which can sap energy levels as much as mental fatigue.\n\n2. Caffeine There are a lot of natural ways to get caffeine into your system besides drinking a cup of coffee. Tea, chocolate, and other herbs have the ability to provide you with this natural psychoactive boost to your energy levels. Try to limit how much caffeine you consume, however, no matter what form it takes because even natural caffeine will cause shakiness, insomnia, and even heart palpitations when taken in excess.\n\n3. Eleuthero It\u2019s often used to relieve pain and boost immunity, but this herb does a lot for your energy levels too. It helps to fight off the feelings of fatigue that you might encounter so that you can utilize the energy that you do have more effectively. It can be taken twice a day for a double energy boost, take one in the morning and then one around your mid-day meal, otherwise you may find that insomnia could become a new issue. It can increase blood pressure, so avoid this herb if you\u2019ve got problems with blood pressure at the moment.\n\n4. Ginseng Sometimes the ability to feel more awake is all a person needs to be able to more effectively access their energy reserves. That\u2019s what ginseng tends to do for people and why it is included in many energy drinks today. Some forms of ginseng, especially red ginseng, are also thought to help people be able to maximize the energy production process that the digestive system creates. It is also thought to help reduce stress levels, which can also rob people of energy because of the emotional and mental toll that stress can provide.\n\n5. Oregano Who thought that eating pizza could help to give you extra energy from the herbs instead of the carbohydrates of the crust? Oregano actually helps to detoxify your system so that it can fight of the remnants of foreign invaders like viruses that could be tapping into your power systems. The best way to use oregano is to create an oil out of it. You can purchase oil of oregano on its own as a supplement, or you can make your own at home using olive oil and some of the dried leaves in your spice cabinet. Just a couple of drops in water every day will boost your antioxidant levels and help your body digest your food more efficiently.\n\n6. Rhodiola You could make this into a tea, but it would taste terrible and you\u2019d never want to drink it again. It\u2019s best to grab an extract that you can take each morning because you\u2019ll proactively combat the stresses and depression that can rob you of the energy you need to get through your day. It helps to increase your overall stamina as well, which means your focus can stay on your work project instead of the distractions going on around you.\n\n7. Wheatgrass To be fair, all green drinks can help to detoxify the body and help you better utilize your energy reserves. Wheatgrass makes the list, however, because it can pack all of the nutrients you need for your day into one tiny little shot. Most people have their adrenal glands working at their peak levels about two hours after their mealtimes, so taking in a green drink at about 10 am and then 2 pm can help to boost energy levels at the perfect moment when a little help is needed. A little extra protein powder can help to further those energy reserves and in a green drink, a little protein will go a long way.\n\nIn addition to these items, you\u2019ll find that the B vitamins will provide a much-needed boost of energy to get through your day. A simple B complex is often all that is needed for a massive dose of energy. Combine those vitamins with these other natural methods of making sure you\u2019ve got the energy you need to blast through that fatigue wall. Take them today and you\u2019ll get your focus back without any trouble at all.",

    "content": "Hydrocortisone treatment for adrenal fatigue is a popular way to treat this condition. That is because hydrocortisone actually restores the proper levels of cortisone in the body that is normally produced by the adrenal gland.\n\nWhat is Hydrocortisone?\n\nEssentially, it is a supplement for the cortisone that should be present in your body if the adrenal gland was functioning properly. This is a very common form of treatment for adrenal fatigue and it has been used successfully on many people.\n\nDuring the time the adrenal gland is recovering, the body can operate at near normal levels of activity and continue doing the daily routines that you have become accustomed. While it is not a cure for adrenal fatigue, it is more of a supplement that allows for the temporary introduction of hydrocortisone which replaces the natural cortisone missing from the body itself.\n\nFor many, this type of treatment is highly effective and results in the body being able to undergo a full recovery. Naturally, there needs to be a significant reduction to the level of stress either physical or emotional that has triggered adrenal fatigue, a proper diet must be consumed and a person needs plenty of rest as well so that they can fully recover.\n\nPotential Side Effects\n\nHowever, using hydrocortisone supplements have some side effects when not using the proper amounts. Too much hydrocortisone can lead to some unwanted conditions in the body that will need to be monitored in order to reduce the amounts that are given or alter the type of treatment entirely.\n\nWhat follows is a list of the more serious side effects that were encountered while using hydrocortisone treatments. The side effects are considered somewhat rare, but when they do happen they need to be reported to your doctor immediately.\n\nWeight Gain: An unexpected weight gain is one of the more common side effects as it is often accompanied by a \u201cBuddha belly\u201d which carries with it the negative effects of obesity.\n\nGlaucoma: When left unchecked glaucoma can lead to blindness. However, this condition is now far more treatable today especially in the early stages.\n\nImmune Suppression: When the immune system is repressed it allows for dormant diseases to activate, fungal infections to grow and even offers resistance to certain forms of cancer treatments as well.\n\nDiabetes: For those who are already overweight, this is a possible complication as well.\n\nIn addition, insomnia is another potential side effect which can actually have some dire consequences since it leads to an inability to tolerate any amount of stress and may lead to a crisis situation. For those who are suffering from insomnia, reporting this to your doctor is paramount in your treatment process.\n\nFor anyone who is taking hydrocortisone in their treatment of adrenal fatigue, it is important to monitor any potential side effects and report it to their doctor as quickly as possible. Waiting too long only complicates any recovery treatment and may lead to circumstances that can be very dangerous to the life of the patient.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!\n\nThere are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents.\n\nBecause of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.\n\nIf this is something you're also interested in, you can easily copy my \"proven formula\", implement it and start seeing and feeling results within minutes...",

    "content": "Adrenal fatigue is one of the trickier types of conditions to treat in the body as it is result of the adrenal glands being overworked usually because of physical or emotional stress. This means that unlike an injured or damaged part of the body that must heal or be repaired, the adrenal glands must rest and re-fortify in order to resume their previous function.\n\nFirst and foremost, the cause of the adrenal fatigue must be removed in order for the glands to be restored. Otherwise, no amount of vitamins or restorative elements will enable the adrenal glands to come back to their former selves. Once this has been accomplished, the next step is administering the right type of treatment for adrenal fatigue which must include more rest and sleep for regeneration to begin.\n\nIn addition, there are different vitamins and minerals that can be consumed to help accelerate the process of recovery. What follows are the best vitamins to help in the recovery process.\n\nVitamins to Restore the Body from Adrenal Fatigue\n\nVitamin C: This particular vitamin does a number of things besides help fortify the adrenal glands and assist in their recover. It is really essential for the adrenal glands to recover because it actually helps the adrenal glands function during periods of stress. Numerous studies have shown that taking Vitamin C actually helps to lower the amount of epinephrine, norepi and cortisol produced when the body is under physical or emotional stress. This means that the adrenal glands actually have to work less under these conditions.\n\nPlus, Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant as well which protects the body from the free radicals which can cause premature aging to take place. This means that Vitamin C helps restore the body as a whole as well as the adrenal glands.\n\nB Vitamins: In particular, Vitamins B5 and B6 have a powerful affect on the energy levels in the body, most notable because they help turn the sugar in the bloodstream into energy. By adding more energy to the body, you can get more accomplished without having to strain the adrenal glands. In effect, taking B Vitamins in general will help the body overall and also support adrenal function.\n\nIn addition to taking vitamins, minerals such as magnesium and calcium in particular have a potent effect on the body as well as supporting the function of the adrenal glands. Basically, by using the combination of vitamins and minerals to help the body processes go faster and provide more energy, you are taking the load off the adrenal glands which can now use the time to properly recover.\n\nNothing takes the place of rest and overall reduction of stress on the body, but you can fortify your adrenal glands and help them to recover properly by taking the proper vitamin and mineral supplements that will restore your energy and allow you to fully recover to your old self. Just be sure to check with your doctor first to properly diagnose that you are suffering from adrenal fatigue.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!\n\nThere are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents.\n\nBecause of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.\n\nIf this is something you're also interested in, you can easily copy my \"proven formula\", implement it and start seeing and feeling results within minutes...",

    "content": "Adrenal fatigue is a condition that many people experience after they have undergone a long physical or emotional stress, particularly after an illness. In essence, adrenal fatigue is our body that is now recovering from the recovery process of being stressed by different factors over a long period of time. Unfortunately, most people will go right back to work or their daily lives which can create additional complications in the long run.\n\nStruggling with adrenal fatigue usually means having problems falling asleep, an inability to focus correctly and issues with memory function. You may also feel overwhelmed, short-tempered and anxious while undergoing adrenal fatigue. Many people try to compensate by drinking caffeinated beverages, but that only make the condition worse over time.\n\nFortunately, there are several cures that work well in overcoming the effects of adrenal fatigue and allowing your body to fully recover. Plus, all of these cures are completely natural, healthy and inexpensive as well.\n\nGo to Sleep at the Same Time Every Night\n\nAdmittedly for many people, this is easier said than done. Quite often we will shortchange our sleep during the workweek and try to catch up on the weekends. However, few of us really do catch up on the weekends which lead to greater fatigue.\n\nBy going to bed at the same time each night, you can put your body into a better rhythm during the day. The certainty of getting more sleep during the week will help you body adjust and recover properly.\n\nReduce Caffeine and Sugars\n\nCaffeine and sugar are stimulants that keep the body artificially \u201cup\u201d when ingested. If you love your coffee and need a sugar treat, then stop consuming them after lunch so that they can pass from your bloodstream well before you go to bed that evening.\n\nBy adding more protein to your diet, your body can recover more quickly and feel less tired throughout the day. Protein is the building block for muscles and supports the other functions of your body as well. Try to consume the most amount of protein for breakfast and then the rest at dinner.\n\nDrink Water with Lemon\n\nYou will need to revitalize your body by adding much-needed electrolytes. You don\u2019t need to purchase any fancy drinks, just adding lemon juice to your water will be more than sufficient. Electrolytes help your body and mind to function properly and you will feel better during the day as well.\n\nBy eating mostly proteins along with light side dishes, you can enjoy a better night\u2019s sleep. This is especially true if you add a mixture of chamomile and passionflower which is called \u201cpassiflora\u201d into your system about 20 minutes before going to bed.\n\nAvena Sativa or oat is another herb that works well to relax the body and quiet the nerves. When added to meals, it will help your body to relax more and get a better night\u2019s sleep.\n\nYou should check out natural herbs and products that can help your body relax and recover naturally from adrenal fatigue so that you can get on with your life more quickly.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!\n\nThere are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents.\n\nBecause of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.\n\nIf this is something you're also interested in, you can easily copy my \"proven formula\", implement it and start seeing and feeling results within minutes...",

    "content": "For those who have been suffering from anxiety attacks, one possible source is the imbalance your body is enduring through the consumption of too much caffeine and snacks filled with sugar. Such sources can cause a cycle of \u201crising and crashing\u201d that provides your body with too much energy and then none at all once it is fully consumed by the body.\n\nHowever, there is a natural substance that provides plenty of energy throughout the day while also combating the effects of anxiety attacks. Oat straw has proven to be a very valuable source of good energy, improved physical performance and even supports the health of the mind as well.\n\nAlso called Avena sativa, oat straw comes from green oats and has been known to supply helpful materials to the body for hundreds of years. Since the Middle Ages, many people have consumed oat straw in various forms to help provide them with energy and good mental health that also reduces anxiety.\n\nHow exactly oat straw works is not very well known despite the fact that it seems to have a widespread effect on the body itself. Of the many different studies performed, the most interesting showed that oat straw increases the alpha-2 brainwaves which are generally more available during times when we are awake and moving about.\n\nIn addition, the amount of nitric oxide is increased in the bloodstream which helps suppress the cytokines in artery walls which can otherwise inflame and cause a decrease in blood flow. By keeping the blood flow higher while not accelerating the heart, people generally feel more alert and awake than they would otherwise.\n\nOne particular test with oat straw demonstrated that people taking cognitive tests were more alert and responsive which demonstrates the effect that this product has on the mind as well as the body. There have also been studies that show oat straw increases libido and overall sexual performance and may very well be the origin of the phrase \u201csew your wild oats\u201d.\n\nHow Oat Straw Affects Anxiety\n\nBecause the mind is certainly affected by the additional blood flow, it also opens up the communications between the mind and body as well. This means that oat straw acts as a means to allow the body to restore balance and regain calmness faster and more easily. While oat straw does not prevent anxiety attacks from occurring, a diet that regularly consumes a small amount of oat straw each day can help reduce many types of anxiety attacks and when used with other natural substances such as magnesium glycinate for example can greatly reduce the effects of anxiety on the body.\n\nAnother advantage of oat straw is that it is relatively inexpensive whether purchased in its raw form or as a powder which can be used as a supplement. In fact, many people sprinkle a little oat straw powder on their meals to provide them with the product while eating breakfast or lunch.\n\nOverall, oat straw is an excellent supplement for a healthy diet whether you suffer from anxiety attacks or not. However for those that do, consuming a regular amount of oat straw on a daily basis can significantly reduce the effects of anxiety on your body.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Adrenal fatigue is a very common problem for those who have suffered from a long illness or have undergone a long period of time under stress. The result is that the adrenal glands are now overtaxed and the body feels tired and the mind has difficulty in focusing on tasks. Unfortunately, too many people who suffer from adrenal fatigue try to overcompensate by consuming caffeinated products which often results in the body \u201ccrashing\u201d after the initial effects of the caffeine wear off.\n\nHowever, there are natural substances that can be used to help stimulate the body while also reducing the levels of stress that are taxing the adrenal glands. Rhodiola is one of the more common, natural substances which have been used for many years to combat the effects of adrenal fatigue.\n\nRhodiola is a natural herb that has been used for centuries in helping to energize the body. However, it has recently been used as a way to combat the effects of adrenal fatigue while providing stress relief to the body itself.\n\nHowever, there is some controversy to the use of Rhodiola as well. While no one disputes its positive anti-stress effects and lack of side effects, it also acts as a stimulant which means that the body might crash just like with taking in caffeine.\n\nWhat are the Effects of Rhodiola?\n\nEssentially, Rhodiola produces two main effects on the body. It helps reduce the levels of stress and treats symptoms of burnout which is very common with those who have undergone a considerable amount of stress in their lives.\n\nOn the other hand, it also acts as a stimulant as well. The dangers of the stimulant are that it counters its calming ingredients which result in the body crashing just like if it took in caffeine or sugar for an energy boost.\n\nPeople who suffer from adrenal fatigue essentially have no reserve of energy to work from unlike people who do not suffer from this condition. In essence, a person with normal adrenal gland function will get an energy boost from Rhodiola and once it wears off the energy levels will drop to the same or perhaps slightly lower levels than before.\n\nHowever, a person with adrenal fatigue may drop a lot further than that once the effects of Rhodiola wear off. The effects will be quite profound and can certainly affect your performance on the job or worse, when driving or operating heavy machinery where having good mental concentration is a must.\n\nShould You Take Rhodiola for Adrenal Fatigue?\n\nThe answer is that you should take it in very moderate amounts so that the overall boost of energy levels is not so much that there will be a \u201ccrash\u201d. By moderating the amount that is taken, you can better enjoy the benefits of Rhodiola in reducing the amount of stress that is being experienced.\n\nIn conclusion, you should be careful about taking any stimulant when suffering from adrenal fatigue. But Rhodiola is one that when taken in moderate amounts can be very beneficial in reducing the effects of this condition.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!\n\nThere are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents.\n\nBecause of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.\n\nIf this is something you're also interested in, you can easily copy my \"proven formula\", implement it and start seeing and feeling results within minutes...",

Adrenal fatigue is often the aftermath of suffering from a prolonged amount of stress or illness that is only complicated by trying to maintain a normal lifestyle afterwards.\n\nFor many, prescribed treatments and medications do little to help solve the issue and taking in caffeine and other stimulants just to get through the day only make you feel worse. Fortunately, there are simple, straightforward holistic treatments that can help relieve the effects of adrenal fatigue.\n\nEssentially, there is no \u201ccure\u201d for adrenal fatigue as your body has to recover from the effects. By using these holistic treatments, you can turn your life around and start the process of recover the natural way.\n\nEffective Holistic Treatments for Adrenal Fatigue\n\nFirst things first, you have to commit yourself to a schedule, proper diet and lessening the stress in your life. While these changes in your lifestyle may seem easily obtainable, remember that you will have to commit to them in order to let your body properly recover.\n\nGo to Bed at the Same Time Each Night: Your body relies on having a routine in order to get the proper amount of sleep. This means that you need to hit the sack and then wake up at the same time so that your energy levels can start to increase.\n\nAdd Electrolytes: Drinking plenty of water each day will help your body rejuvenate faster as well. However, you can spice up your water with a slice of lemon and kick up the amount of electrolytes which will further enhance your body.\n\nIncrease Your Protein Intake: Protein not only helps build and maintain the muscles, it can also assist in overcoming the effects of adrenal fatigue. You will need to properly calculate the amount of protein you will have to consume on a daily basis through the intake of lean meats, beans and other sources.\n\nAdd More Raw Oats: Avena sativa for example is a great tonic for calming the nerves. Adding raw oats to your diet or using them as part of your nightly bath can help rejuvenate you in a natural way.\n\nCut Down on Stimulants\n\nBasically, you will want to reduce your caffeine and sugar intake as much as possible, but do this gradually over time. A sudden loss of caffeine or other stimulants may produce an unwanted shock to your system. So instead, start by cutting out the caffeine during the afternoon and evening hours and save it just for the morning for a little kick start.\n\nBy eating a light, healthy dinner you can help your body prepare itself for sleep. By eating a meal that can be digested quickly, your body will begin the process of winding down and getting ready for bed.\n\nThese are just a few holistic methods that can help rejuvenate your body and overcome the effects of adrenal fatigue.

    "content": "Adrenal fatigue is a condition in which the body cannot seem to get going. Usually, adrenal fatigue occurs after a person has undergone a prolonged period of either physical or emotional stress or has suffered from a long illness. People who suffer from adrenal fatigue feel tired all the time, but often cannot go to sleep easily. Unfortunately, many people aggravate the problem by consuming too many stimulants like sugar and caffeine which only prolongs the state of adrenal fatigue.\n\nThere is no cure for adrenal fatigue apart from letting the body recover on its own. The recovery process can be sped up by using a number of different methods including Dhea to help the body return to its normal state.\n\nDhea is a precursor hormone and steroid that is produced by the body the adrenal gland. It is available as an over the counter supplements as well because for those suffering from adrenal fatigue, less Dhea is produced in the body. Many have claimed that Dhea is a \u201ccure-all\u201d for many different health issues from depression to weight loss. Even top level athletes have been accused of \u201cdoping\u201d by adding more Dhea to their systems than allowed.\n\nMen produce more Dhea in their systems than women which may be in part why adrenal fatigue seems to affect more women than men. The natural production of Dhea in the body peaks in the 20s and gradually tapers off as we reach our 70s when it is a mere 20% of what existed in our youth. The decline of Dhea in the body is a natural, healthy process, but it does leave a person more vulnerable to developing adrenal fatigue.\n\nWhile the hype around Dhea seems overrated when it comes to the breadth of the assistance it provides, there is no doubt that it works quite well as a means of overcoming adrenal fatigue when taken in the proper amounts. However, it takes more than just popping a pill of Dhea and getting on with your day. For many women who suffer from adrenal fatigue, it will take a broader approach in order to get back on their feet in a meaningful way.\n\nHow Dhea Can Work for You\n\nFor those suffering from adrenal fatigue, a combination of Dhea and other holistic treatments can help bring your body back to normal in a quicker fashion. This means following a healthy diet, including a good intake of protein on a daily basis, getting plenty of rest and gradually eliminating stimulants such as sugar and caffeine which only aggravate the conditions of adrenal fatigue.\n\nDhea needs to be regulated with the help of your physician so that the right amount is taken on a daily basis. The boost to your body that Dhea brings means that you can regain your energy quickly while the body begins to recover naturally. Over time, the amount of Dhea that needs to be taken can be dropped as the adrenal glands once again take over production.\n\nAll in all, taking supplements of Dhea is an excellent means of overcoming adrenal fatigue as long as it is under a doctor\u2019s supervision and is augmented by natural, holistic practices. For many women in particular, Dhea represents a real breakthrough in the fight against adrenal fatigue.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!\n\nThere are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents.\n\nBecause of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.\n\nIf this is something you're also interested in, you can easily copy my \"proven formula\", implement it and start seeing and feeling results within minutes...",

    "content": "Adrenal fatigue affects many thousands of men and women in the US alone as it saps the energy from the body, leaving people restless, have difficult focusing on tasks and making it difficult to get a good night\u2019s sleep. The condition of adrenal fatigue usually occurs after a long illness or period of physical or emotional stress. Once the adrenal glands have been overtaxed, it takes time for them to fully recover.\n\nTreating adrenal fatigue has been difficult in the past because there is no \u201ccure\u201d in the general sense. However, adrenal fatigue can be treated in helping the body renew its energies and get back to a normal life more quickly using a number of methods.\n\nOne of the more interesting treatments for adrenal fatigue is acupuncture. Traditional Chinese acupuncture has been used for a number of different types of conditions, but adrenal fatigue is actually well suited for the effects of acupuncture.\n\nHow Acupuncture Works to Overcome the Effects of Adrenal Fatigue\n\nEssentially, acupuncture helps restore the proper state of internal balance in the body. Because the adrenal glands are fatigued, they no longer produce the proper amount of hormones which in turn affects the entire body.\n\nAcupuncture stimulates the body and helps release the proper chemicals generated by the body into the organs. In turn, these chemicals will help reduce the pain, inflammation or assist in secreting hormones that the body is not producing in normal amounts. For those who suffer from adrenal fatigue, this means that the production of hormones is being stimulated so that it will restore itself to normal levels.\n\nThe acupuncture treatments themselves may start to show signs of working immediately in some patients while others will take several sessions. For most, the acupuncture will take a little time for the effects to be fully felt much like exercise takes time to get the muscles into shape. Generally speaking, the greater the effects of the adrenal fatigue, the longer it will take the acupuncture to work.\n\nAdditional Treatments for Adrenal Fatigue\n\nIn addition to the acupuncture, it is recommended that patients try to restore the natural balance of their hormonal production using additional methods as well starting by eating a healthy diet that contains more protein to help the body recover properly.\n\nNo Stimulants: Sugar and caffeine will need to be gradually cut from the diet in order for the adrenal glands to be fully restored. This is because stimulants have the effect of working the already stressed adrenal glands to the limit. Gradually cutting down on caffeine, sugar and other stimulants will help the body recover.\n\nSleep: One symptom of adrenal fatigue is the lack of sleep.

    "content": "To fight the effects of adrenal fatigue is no easy matter since it requires a balanced approach that uses the right types of treatments that do not overtax the adrenal glands. Essentially, your body is not \u201csick\u201d in the common sense, but is more worn down by stress or the effects of a long illness. This means that you need to revitalize the body without too much stimulation in order to overcome the affects of adrenal fatigue.\n\nOne of the major elements in fighting adrenal fatigue is consuming the right nutrients in order to restore balance to the body. However, there is the danger of taking in too many nutrients which will simply prolong the effects of adrenal fatigue or not enough which means it will take longer to fully recover.\n\nHow to take the Right Amount of Nutrients\n\nFirst things first, you need to ensure that the nutrients that you are consuming are coming from the best sources. Taking supplements from a low-quality manufacturer is not going to help you very much in fighting the effects of adrenal fatigue.\n\nMore Protein: Protein is an essential building block and consuming more of this substance will help your body recover faster. You do not have to use supplements as long as you eat food sources that are high in protein, such as lean meats, beans and so forth.\n\nVitamins: There are a number of vitamins that can bolster the body in general and provide the right type of energy needed that will not stress the adrenal glands. They include the following:\n\n1. Vitamins B5 & B12 2. Vitamin C 3. Vitamin E\n\nWhen taken in the proper amounts, these vitamins will boost the energy levels in the body. However, taking too much will add unneeded complications and not help your adrenal fatigue.\n\nHerbs: There are a number of excellent herbs which provides the right type of stimulation which will boost your adrenal gland activity in a natural way. By taking the proper amount of herbs such as ginseng, licorice, ashawanda and more you can help fight the effects of being tired and restless while gaining greater mental focus as well.\n\nThe Proper Balance of Nutrients\n\nWhile consuming the right nutrients is important in helping you overcome the effects of adrenal fatigue. It is also vital that you consume them in the right amount. In this case, you may need to see your doctor in order to get a proper diagnosis and understand fully the right amount of nutrients required in order to get you back on your feet.\n\nThe purpose of treating your adrenal fatigue is to help the body recover overall. By taking in too much of a single type of nutrient may stress your adrenal glands even further. Generally speaking, you should stay within the proper amount of herbs and nutrients that are recommended unless your doctor advises otherwise.\n\nFor many, fighting the effects of adrenal fatigue through the use of nutrients will help overcome the symptoms faster and actually lead to a healthier life. The nutrients that are required should generally be consumed on a daily basis which means enjoying a better quality of life over the long run.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!\n\nThere are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents.\n\nBecause of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.\n\nIf this is something you're also interested in, you can easily copy my \"proven formula\", implement it and start seeing and feeling results within minutes...",

    "content": "Adrenal fatigue is a debilitating condition that is usually the aftermath from suffering from a prolonged illness or stress either physical or emotional in nature. With the adrenal glands essentially stressed to their limits, they no longer produce a normal amount of hormones and the body enters an imbalanced state which causes a person to feel very tired, yet they cannot get enough sleep.\n\nUnfortunately, many people overlook the signs of adrenal fatigue and use stimulants like sugar and caffeine to help get them through the day which in turn only prolongs the condition. Instead, the right course of action is to help the body recover and restore the adrenal glands naturally through rest, recuperation and a number of natural treatments as well.\n\nUsing herbs or herbal medicines is a common way to treat adrenal fatigue. There are certain herbs that stimulate the body in the right way to help restore the function of the adrenal glands without creating more stress or unnatural energy. Of course, you will need to choose the right herbs in order to get the desired effect.\n\nThe Five Best Herbs for Adrenal Fatigue\n\n1. Licorice: This has been a part of traditional medicine for many years and contains elements that actually help properly stimulate the adrenal glands in the right manner. Care must be taken not to take in too much licorice as it can have a debilitating effect on the kidneys. However, it not only provides assistance for those with adrenal gland issues, but also provides many different health benefits as well.\n\n2. Ginkgo: This is a very common herb that is used for a number of different effects. Most notably, ginkgo can help reduce stress levels which are straining the adrenal glands. Whether in tablet or liquid form, ginkgo is an excellent herb to fight the effects of adrenal fatigue.\n\n3. Ginseng: In particular, Korean ginseng is an excellent herb to be used to help relieve physical or mental stress which plays an important role in recovery. In fact, ginseng has been used to help better the circulation, improve the memory and even reduce incidents of the common cold. What can be stated about ginseng in terms of adrenal fatigue is that it does provide the right support so that the adrenal glands can recover.\n\n4. Rhodiola: Another common herb that has been used for many centuries in herbal medicines, rhodiola helps treat mild forms of depression as well as reducing the stress levels in the body. Plus, it works very well with ginseng in helping to lower anxiety and improve overall mental function.\n\n5. Astragalus: A recent entry in terms of Western medicine, astragalus has been used in Chinese medicines for many years. Its overall effect is to combat the feeling of being \u201crun down\u201d and helps people get up and on with their day without the typical stimulants of caffeine or sugar. In addition, it has a number of other healthy benefits as well.\n\nOverall, these are the five best herbs for use against the effects of adrenal fatigue. Remember to use them wisely and if you have any complications to see your doctor immediately.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!\n\nThere are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents.\n\nBecause of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.\n\nIf this is something you're also interested in, you can easily copy my \"proven formula\", implement it and start seeing and feeling results within minutes...",

    "content": "Feeling sluggish, struggling to lose weight, or battling unexplained fatigue?\n\nThese could be signs that your metabolism is slow. But, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nMany people face these frustrations without realizing their metabolism is to blame. Understanding these signs can help you take charge of your metabolism and get your body back on track.\n\nWe\u2019ll unravel the mysteries behind a sluggish metabolism and explore the top ten signs to watch out for.\n\nFrom stubborn weight gain to constant tiredness, we\u2019ll break down each symptom.\n\nJoin us on this journey as we decode the secrets of slow metabolism and give you the tools to unleash your body\u2019s natural fat-burning potential.\n\nGet ready to reclaim your energy, shed those stubborn pounds, and become the best version of yourself!\n\nUnderstanding Metabolism: The Basics\n\nMetabolism is like the engine that powers your body.\n\nIt\u2019s the process by which your cells convert the food you eat into energy. This energy fuels everything your body does, from breathing and digesting food to moving and even thinking.\n\nYour metabolic rate determines how quickly your body burns calories.\n\nA faster metabolism means you burn more calories, even when you\u2019re resting.\n\nA slower metabolism means you burn fewer calories, making it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it.\n\nMaintaining a healthy metabolism is essential for overall health and weight management.\n\nWhen your metabolism is working properly, it helps regulate your body weight.\n\nBut metabolism does more than just control your weight. It also affects your body\u2019s ability to repair itself, produce hormones, fight off infections, and even regulate your mood and concentration.\n\nFactors That Affect Metabolism\n\nSeveral factors can influence your metabolism, including your age, genetics, body composition, and lifestyle choices.\n\nWhile some of these factors are beyond your control, there are things you can do to boost your metabolism and support weight loss.\n\nAge is one factor that affects metabolism. As you get older, your metabolism naturally slows down, partly because you tend to lose muscle mass as you age.\n\nHormonal changes, such as those that occur during menopause, can also contribute to a slower metabolism.\n\nGenetics also plays a role in determining your metabolic rate. Some people are born with a faster metabolism, while others inherit a slower one from their parents.\n\nYour body composition, specifically the ratio of muscle to fat, also influences your metabolism. Muscle tissue burns more calories, so people with more muscle tend to have a higher metabolism.\n\nFinally, lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and sleep can all affect your metabolism. Eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and getting enough sleep are all important for keeping your metabolism running smoothly.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the basics, let\u2019s take a look at some common signs of slow metabolism. Recognizing these signs can help you determine if your metabolism needs a boost.\n\nStruggling to lose weight or experiencing unexpected weight gain despite your best efforts to eat well and exercise could be a sign of a slow metabolism.\n\nWhen your metabolism is sluggish, your body burns fewer calories, making it harder to lose weight. It can also lead to the accumulation of fat, resulting in weight gain.\n\nFeeling tired and lacking energy, even when you\u2019re getting enough sleep, could indicate a slow metabolism.\n\nWhen your body isn\u2019t efficiently converting food into energy, you may experience persistent fatigue, making it difficult to stay alert throughout the day.\n\nIf you find it particularly challenging to lose belly fat, it could be a sign that your metabolism is running slow.\n\nBelly fat, also known as visceral fat, is not only unsightly but also linked to an increased risk of health problems like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\nA slow metabolism can contribute to the accumulation of belly fat, making it harder to lose.\n\nFor women, irregular periods or fertility problems could be a sign of a slow metabolism.\n\nHormonal imbalances caused by a sluggish metabolism can disrupt the normal functioning of the reproductive system.\n\nFeeling cold or having a low tolerance for cold temperatures, could indicate a slow metabolism.\n\nWhen your metabolism is sluggish, your body may have trouble generating heat, leaving you feeling cold more often.\n\nTips for Boosting Metabolism and Supporting Weight Loss\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing signs of a slow metabolism, there are steps you can take to give it a boost and support weight loss.\n\nIncorporate Strength Training: Adding strength training exercises to your workout routine can help increase muscle mass and boost your metabolism.\n\nTry High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): HIIT workouts are a great way to burn calories and rev up your metabolism in a short amount of time.\n\nEat a Balanced Diet: Focus on eating whole, nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats to support a healthy metabolism.\n\nStay Hydrated: Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help keep your metabolism running smoothly.\n\nGet Enough Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to support a healthy metabolism and overall well-being.\n\nManage Stress: Chronic stress can take a toll on your metabolism, so practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\nAvoid Crash Diets: Restrictive diets can slow down your metabolism and make it harder to lose weight in the long run.\n\nStay Active: Find ways to incorporate movement into your daily routine, whether it\u2019s taking the stairs instead of the elevator or going for a walk during your lunch break.\n\nBe Consistent: Consistency is key when it comes to boosting your metabolism and supporting weight loss. Stick to your healthy habits and don\u2019t get discouraged if you don\u2019t see results right away.\n\nConsult a Professional: If you\u2019re struggling to boost your metabolism on your own, consider consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance.\n\nA slow metabolism can present a number of challenges, from weight gain and fatigue to fertility issues and feeling cold all the time.\n\nRecognizing the signs and taking steps to boost your metabolism can help you overcome these challenges and support weight loss and overall health.\n\nSo take action today and start unlocking the secrets of your metabolism!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

That\u2019s a lot, right?\n\nAnd one big reason is that people lose steam.\n\nThey start strong but then lose motivation along the way.\n\nBut if you want to make it, you\u2019ve got to keep pushing forward, no matter what.\n\nThe same goes for getting healthy.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there \u2013 excited to hit the gym at first, but then slowly losing interest.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2013 real change takes time. You\u2019ve got to stick with it, even when you don\u2019t see results right away.\n\nIn my own life, running a supplement company, I\u2019ve seen how important consistency is.\n\nPeople often expect quick fixes, but that\u2019s just not how it works. You\u2019ve got to stick to your plan, day in and day out, even when it\u2019s hard.\n\nI like to think of it like growing a plant. You\u2019ve got to water it every day, even when you don\u2019t see anything happening.

Are you giving them the attention they deserve? If not, why?\n\nFigure out what\u2019s holding you back and make a plan to overcome it.\n\nAnd remember \u2013 success isn\u2019t just about reaching your goals; it\u2019s about the journey.

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about a very important topic and that\u2019s salt.\n\nWhy this essential mineral is so crucial to your existence, energy levels, mood, muscles, hormones, and brain health?\n\nAnd this brings today\u2019s main topic \u2013 comparing the pros and cons of sea salt, vs table salt vs Himalayan pink salt.\n\nMost importantly, warnings about which form of salt you should avoid.\n\nThus, which is good or bad for your health.\n\nKeep in mind that sodium is especially important for people who exercise regularly, get muscle cramps, have higher anxiety levels, feel tired, don\u2019t sleep well, have joint pain, and are also concerned about wrinkles.\n\nAnd before I start, know that salt is not directly linked to high blood pressure.\n\nDehydration, plus high salt, combined with low water and high carbohydrate intake IS the real problem of high blood pressure.\n\nWhich is what most people\u2019s diets are.\n\nThis is exactly what you get when you eat man-made, pre-packaged foods found in fast food restaurants and grocery stores.\n\nHowever, some of the healthiest people on the planet live by the ocean, eating lots of seafood, which all contain sodium.\n\nHaving high blood pressure is linked to aging and that\u2019s because of the decline in your youth hormones, plus weaker kidney function due to aging and also insulin resistance.\n\nIf you want a natural way to promote healthy blood pressure levels, I suggest you use Blood Pressure Optimizer, which is what my parents have been using for about 20 years.\n\nInteresting Facts About Salt\n\nBut let\u2019s start with some interesting facts about salt\u2026\n\nYour body is made up mostly of water, up to 70% or so, especially when you\u2019re younger and have good hormones. As we age, the water content drops and this leads to dehydration, lower energy levels, wrinkles, smaller muscles, anxiety, and other health issues.\n\nBy the way, the water in your body is salt water.\n\nThus, drinking regular water all day long isn\u2019t going to hydrate you the way salt water does.\n\nIn fact, when you go to the hospital and they give you an IV drip of saline, that\u2019s salt water.\n\nWhat\u2019s also interesting is over 95% of the earth\u2019s surface is covered in salt water.\n\nI mention all of this because yes, water and salt are very important.\n\nThe more water you drink, the more salt you need to help absorb it.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve run into this problem when you drink a lot of water and you just seem to be peeing it all out minutes later.\n\nThis is because you\u2019re not absorbing it well. Hormones are one reason \u2013 such as insulin, testosterone, estrogens, growth hormone, and so forth. But also a lack of electrolytes is another. Salt is the primary one.\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the comparisons.\n\nThis is what\u2019s normally found and is often used.\n\nSource: Usually mined from salt deposits in the earth and heavily processed to eliminate minerals.\n\nComposition: Primarily consists of sodium chloride. Often contains additives to prevent clumping, such as calcium silicate, and is sometimes iodized (iodine is added) to prevent iodine deficiency.\n\nTexture and Flavor: Fine-grained, highly refined, and has a strong salty flavor.\n\nHealth Aspects: Its added iodine content is beneficial for the thyroid. However, the lack of additional minerals makes it less nutritionally diverse. It\u2019s bleached, which is not good. It sometimes has anticaking agents such as aluminum, which can be toxic to the brain.\n\nSo, I would avoid regular table salt.\n\nPeople started using sea salt as a more \u201chealthy\u201d and alternative form of salt compared to table salt.\n\nSource: Produced through the evaporation of seawater, usually with little processing.\n\nComposition: Contains sodium chloride and trace minerals like potassium, iron, and zinc, which may add color and flavor. The exact mineral content can vary based on the water source.\n\nTexture and Flavor: Coarser and less refined than table salt. The flavor can be more complex due to the trace minerals.\n\nHealth Aspects: The trace minerals offer some nutritional benefits. However, sea salt is not safe.\n\nOne major problem with sea salt is that it contains microplastics. The presence of microplastics in sea salt is a result of the increasing pollution of the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nOf course, these microplastics are bad for your health. It can cause inflammation and act as an endocrine disruptor in high dosages.\n\nUnfortunately, several studies have detected up to 90% of microplastics in various brands of sea salt from different parts of the world.\n\nSo, like table salt, I would avoid sea salt as well, unless it\u2019s Celtic Sea salt from France. That has not been shown to contain microplastics.\n\nHowever, Celtic sea salt is a wet salt. It\u2019s not dry like a table or sea salt. It\u2019s a little damp. Which is fine to cook with, but hard to sprinkle on food.\n\nSource: Mined from the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan, believed to be millions of years old.\n\nComposition: Composed mainly of sodium chloride, but is known for its rich mineral content, including calcium, magnesium, potassium, copper, and iron, which give it a distinctive pink color.\n\nTexture and Flavor: Typically has a coarser texture than table salt and a more subtle flavor due to its mineral content.\n\nHealth Aspects: Its mineral content can offer additional nutritional benefits.\n\nSo, if I had to pick one salt to consume, it would be Himalayan Pink Salt or Celtic Sea Salt.\n\nAs far as how much salt you need, I think between 1-2 teaspoons.\n\nThe more water you consume, the more you exercise and sweat, the more salt you can and should take.\n\nAnd those on a very low carbohydrate diet or keto or carnivore diet should consume extra salt as well.\n\nKeep an eye on all the packaged foods and condiments you each which have lots of hidden salts, which is the main problem.\n\nAnd if you want healthy blood pressure levels, make sure you take a look at Blood Pressure Optimizer.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4342096\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18204443\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7778872\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449852",

    "content": "Having better memory and more energy is something we all want or should want, at any age. Why?\u2026\n\nAs with any goal you have, the better your memory, and the more energy you have, the faster and more easily you\u2019ll achieve your goals.\n\nWhether it\u2019s to make more money, or you\u2019re in school, or you play sports, or in relationships, and of course, the older we get the more important memory and energy become.\n\nPeople who succeed in life more than others, almost always are more energetic, driven, and passionate.\n\nThis is the same with athletes.\n\nMichael Jordan was known to require very little sleep and was always on the go. He played hard and also partied hard.\n\nSame with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nHe worked out 3-4 hours daily, had a job, was going to school, and had real estate businesses, and that same memory and energy allowed him to succeed in bodybuilding, acting, and politics.\n\nAlso, great leaders are great readers. Successful people consume lots of information all day long and they can do so because they have good memories.\n\nBill Gates, Warren Buffet, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and others have all stated that they read a lot and have lots of energy.\n\nNo energy and poor brain function = Little success!\n\nAt the very least, it\u2019s a lot harder, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to quickly talk about the best foods, diet, and ingredients for improving your memory and energy levels, at any age.\n\nIf this is a topic that you\u2019re really interested in and would like more details on, make sure to check my blog regularly.\n\nPlus, I\u2019ve got some exclusive content for my private members that you can get access to for free. More details about that are at the end of the article.\n\nLet\u2019s keep things simple with this memory diet.\n\nIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve done a lot of research about since I have a family history of memory loss. And in all honesty, my memory has never been very good. My mom is the same way.\n\nYet, my dad has an awesome memory. But HIS mother had memory issues.\n\nSo, it\u2019s a 50/50 problem for me.\n\nThe diet breakdown is about\n\nSo, it\u2019s more of an isocaloric diet, with almost the same amount of calories from each of the 3 macronutrients.\n\nBest Foods For Memory\n\nNow we need to fill in the categories with the best foods.\n\nYou want to mostly eat:\n\nExtra virgin olive oil\n\nSmall amounts of MCT Oil in the form of C8, Caprylic Acid\n\nI would recommend you eat whole foods, over oils. There are more nutrients and it digests and absorbs better.\n\nFor example, Olives over Olive oil.\n\nYou must stay away from trans and hydrogenated fats and most seed and vegetable oils that are high in omega-6 fats.\n\nThese are the cheap supermarket oils such as soybean, corn, sunflower, and so forth. These are typically found in packaged foods.\n\nYou want to eat more fish but stay away from those high in mercury such as tuna. So I suggest wild-caught salmon.\n\nPasture-raised chicken and turkey.\n\nSmall amounts of grass-fed bison\n\nAnd more vegetable protein sources such as non-GMO rice and hemp protein.\n\nFinally our favorite tasting foods.\n\nYou want to eat lots of vegetables \u2013 especially spinach, seaweed, and Brussels sprouts.\n\nEat fruits, especially berries.\n\nGet colorful with your fruits and vegetables\n\nLegumes are great, especially lentils. Pressure cook them or soak them for a day to remove inflammatory lectins.\n\nYams are fantastic and small amounts of white rice and not brown.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to ask \u201cwhy not brown\u201d, I\u2019ve already done an article about this topic, so read about it here.\n\nEzekiel bread is also good.\n\nYou want lower glycemic foods because high blood sugar is linked to brain and memory problems.\n\nFinally, we have supplements.\n\nPersonally, I think most supplements are worthless because they are poorly formulated with the wrong ingredients, wrong doses, and wrong combinations.\n\nHowever, there are specific supplements \u2014 herbs and amino acids that are clinically proven to help improve memory, blood flow to the brain, more oxygen to your cells, and increase energy throughout your entire body.\n\nSome of the best ones are:\n\nThings that improve mitochondria \u2013 such as CoQ10, PQQ and Acetyl L Carnitine\n\nIncrease oxygen and brain circulation \u2013 such as Ginkgo, Green Tea Extract and Vinpocetine\n\nATP for more cellular energy \u2013 Rhodiola Extract and NADH\n\nDifferent forms of Choline, which are essential for the brain, are found in whole eggs.\n\nNootropics such as Bacopa extract.\n\nIncrease Dopamine, which helps with memory, mood, and other brain issues \u2013 the best is green oat extract, Velvet Bean, and L-Theanine.\n\nFinally, ingredients that reduce stress hormones such as cortisol \u2013 would be Phosphatidylserine, Ashwagandha, and Tyrosine.\n\nNow, I know I just listed a bunch of ingredients.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to take each of these individually.\n\nI used to do so and it\u2019s inconvenient and very expensive.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a fantastic product called Body-Brain Energy that contains all of these ingredients and a few others.\n\nIt\u2019s what I personally take and have done so for almost 20 years.\n\nNo matter what you want to achieve in life, any goal you have \u2013 you\u2019ll achieve it much faster, with less effort and you\u2019ll have a lot more fun\u2026 if you have more energy and better brain function and memory.\n\nKeep your diet as natural as possible.\n\nEat fats, carbs, and proteins. Healthy fats are especially important for brain health, as is proper and stable blood sugar levels.\n\nMore importantly, limit junk such as processed foods, sugars, alcohol, drugs, and similar toxins.\n\nOf course, all of this is easier said than done.\n\nSo start slowly with the improvements I suggest today.\n\nAnd make sure you add in the ingredients I mentioned earlier to speed up the process.\n\nBy taking a natural supplement such as Body-Brain Energy, you\u2019ll heal your brain, support healthy memory and energy, and you won\u2019t have to be as strict with your diet.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness-se/using-ibogaine-for-depression/",
    "content": "Are you looking for a natural alternative to the anti-depressants that your doctor is suggesting you should take? Ibogaine is a substance that naturally occurs in certain plants. Is a psychoactive substance that is actually banned in some countries because of its side effects. Some communities use Ibogaine, however, because it has been shown to be effective in psychedelic therapies that treat addictions to harmful substances.\n\nIbogaine has also gained a foothold in the treatment of PTSD and depression. Is it an effective treatment option? Or is it just another placebo that is being marketed to the world at large?\n\nAre You Tired of a Life of Quiet Desperation?\n\nWhat is interesting about the use of Ibogaine is that it allows some users to experience their memories from a different perspective. Instead of finding the negative in an experience, they are able to see the positive outcomes of something that has happened. In doing so, they are able to see past the emotional walls that have built up and placed stress on their mental health. By taking these walls down, it is entirely possible for the symptoms of depression to be treated.\n\nBut who wants to treat depression? Shouldn\u2019t it be cured instead? It\u2019s scary when you have depression affecting you every day. The things you love to do no longer seem like fun. The day becomes an effort to get through and all you want to do is go back to bed to see if tomorrow will be any better. What Ibogaine is able to do is help with the shift of a deeply rooted perspective.\n\nNegative energy acts like an anchor on the mind. By shifting the perspective, energy can be released from this anchor and someone can go on to achieve great things once again with a different look. Ibogaine won\u2019t cause this to happen unless someone wants to change. If they do want to change, then this substance can help.\n\nHow Does Ibogaine Work?\n\nThe idea behind an Ibogaine treatment is that the spiritual side of self needs to be explored just as the physical self needs to be healed. In small amounts, Ibogaine acts as a stimulant and will provide someone with more energy; much like caffeine would when an energy drink is consumed. In large amounts, it becomes a psychoactive compound that can create visions and introspection. These incidents last for up to 6 hours and the theory is that it can help people conquer their fears and the side effect of depression that anxiety and fear has caused.\n\nIt works because it affects different neurotransmitter systems in the brain at the same time. It also needs a low potency, which means high doses may cause neurotoxicity when used over time and may even cause degeneration.\n\nIt is a Schedule I controlled substance in the countries that regulate it, including the United States. It is unregulated in Norway, Canada, and Mexico. This means it could become addictive when not used correctly. For that reason, it is smart to take care to start slowly in the use of Ibogaine to treat depression and do so with close proximity to a doctor\u2019s care.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Have you noticed that the energy drinks you have each day are providing you with less overall energy? Or maybe you\u2019ve had to add two or three shots of espresso to your morning cup of coffee? These are all symptoms of adrenal fatigue and sometimes it takes more than just a good night\u2019s sleep to help rectify the situation. If you\u2019ve been taking energy boosters for awhile, like caffeine or other adrenal stimulants, then you may have conditioned your body to need these items.\n\nThe good news is that there are some good, proven homeopathic remedies that can help you overcome adrenal fatigue so that you can start feeling more like yourself once again. Which one of these remedies could help you?\n\nOne of the primary reasons why people want a pick-me-up in the morning is so they can have better mental clarity. Not only will this herb help to provide that while giving your adrenal glands a break, but you\u2019ll also get help with the immune system. Eleuthero also works as an anti-inflammatory, relaxes the nervous system, and can even keep blood sugar levels regulated so you don\u2019t get stuck with sugar spikes to get through your day.\n\nOne of the most common issues that people face when suffering from adrenal fatigue is an overall lack of energy. This can even result in a feeling of muscle weakness that becomes all encompassing. Joints can hurt, the mind feels dull, and there\u2019s no ambition to do anything at all! Ashwagandha helps to correct this issues without touching your adrenal system so you\u2019ll have the mental and physical energy to get through even a tough day without having higher levels of stress to make that happen.\n\nThis base hormone is responsible for both testosterone and estrogen production in men and women. Now women make more estrogen and guys make more testosterone, but low levels of these basic hormones can become problematic when the adrenal fatigue kicks in. By taking a DHEA supplement, you can create more energy because your body has more of this hormone surging through it. One level of caution with this homeopathic remedy: you can\u2019t always regulate what hormone your body makes. You might end up with a lot of the wrong one.\n\nIf you\u2019re taking a sustained release supplement of Vitamin C, then you\u2019ve got a great tool to use to help boost your immune system and give yourself energy. Don\u2019t go over 4000mg, however, because otherwise you\u2019ll just end up losing all of the benefits that you gained.\n\nIf you take a B complex vitamin twice per day, you\u2019re replacing many of the vitamins that you\u2019d get from an energy drink that give you energy boosts. The difference is that you aren\u2019t deluging your system with caffeine, which means your adrenal system is still going to get the break it needs.\n\nAdd in other proven helpers like pantothenic acid, magnesium, and even iodine and you\u2019ll begin the healing process rapidly without sacrificing a lot of energy in return. If it\u2019s time to feel normal again, this is a good place to start. A Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory! There are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors. Unfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... This is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents. Because of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.

If yes, then make sure you read today\u2019s important article!\n\nFACT: Did you know that caffeine is the most used, popular and ABUSED DRUG on the planet?8 The interesting thing is that most people don\u2019t even consider caffeine a \u201cdrug\u201d.\n\nMost people think that caffeine is \u201cnatural\u201d. Yes, it is \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d in certain substances, such as coffee or tea.\n\nBut by no means is caffeine \u201cnatural\u201d, nor is it good for your body.\n\nHealth Problems With Caffeine\n\nCaffeine, IF used \u201cas needed\u201d (when you\u2019re very tired) and occasionally (maybe 3x a week), is fine. Maybe one cup of coffee or about 100-150 mg worth of caffeine. NOT every day, but 3-4x weekly\u2026\n\nHowever, any more than that and your body starts to deal with the negative effects, such as:\n\nBlood pressure problems1,2\n\nBreast tissue cysts in women4\n\nInsomnia and poor sleep5\n\nBlood sugar problems and poor carbohydrate metabolism6\n\nWrinkles and poor collagen production in your skin7\n\n\u2026 and many other problems.\n\nThe WORST Problem Of All\n\nHowever, in my PERSONAL opinion, the WORST problem with caffeine consumption is the negative change in your hormones due to the RISE in your \u201cstress hormone\u201d called, cortisol!\n\nAt the end of the day, the elevation in this stress hormone is the cause of many of the above-mentioned negative effects.\n\nWe already live in stressful times, with lots of responsibilities and many of us aren\u2019t sleeping well.\n\nCaffeine is just making everything else much worse and it\u2019s accelerating the aging process!\n\nWhy We Like Caffeine So Much\n\nSo, why do you or anyone even take caffeine products?\u2026\n\nYou can have \u201cdecaf\u201d coffee or tea. It tastes the same. So, it\u2019s not about \u201ctaste\u201d.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s simply because you like how it makes you FEEL. We like the extra energy levels \u2014 both physical and mental.\n\nAdditionally, caffeine increases dopamine levels slightly. Dopamine is known as the \u201cpleasure chemical\u201d. So, another reason caffeine makes us \u201chappy\u201d.\n\nHowever, after continued use, your adrenal glands become overworked, cortisol levels increase, dopamine receptors become desensitized and caffeine is NO LONGER making your \u201cenergized and happy\u201d\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s now just keeping you \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nMany times you have a mid-day \u201ccaffeine crash\u201d, which means MORE caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, etc.). Thus, why it\u2019s addictive.\n\nAnd when you get off, the opposite happens \u2014 you\u2019re super tired and depressed!\n\nSo now that you know, let\u2019s talk about better, safer, and healthier alternatives\u2026\n\nHow To Increase Your Energy Levels & Feel Good, WITHOUT Caffeine!\n\nThe good news is that with the correct combination of natural ingredients, you\u2019ll get MANY MORE BENEFITS, without any of the negatives of caffeine.\n\nThat means NO withdrawals. NO addiction. NO crashes.\n\nSo here\u2019s a list of my favorite ingredients for you to use for increased energy levels, improved cognition and anti-aging purposes:\n\nRhodiola Rosea \u2014 great for adrenal fatigue and coming off of caffeine. Improves your mood and helps you deal with stress much better.\n\nAniracetam \u2014 an amazingly safe \u201cnootropic\u201d. This means improved cognition, memory, and brainpower.\n\nDMAE \u2014 great for mental clarity and alertness. Also beneficial for skin rejuvenation\n\nNADH & CoQ10 \u2014 increases ATP and mitochondria production, which dramatically increases your energy levels, naturally.\n\nAcetyl L-Carnitine \u2014 improves cognition, and energy levels is great for the heart, and reduces stress.\n\nAs you can see, lots of benefits. The only \u201cproblem\u201d is that you have to take too buy too many products, take too many pills and it can get expensive.\n\nThis is a challenge that I personally faced myself.\n\nMy Personal Favorite Solution\n\nImagine getting all the benefits of caffeine and MORE, without the negative side effects, and as an added bonus, you\u2019ll look and feel younger too! \u2026\n\nPlus, all you did was just take ONE pill daily, which combined all these scientifically proven ingredients, along with a few other key vitamins and minerals.\n\nMany years ago I was always tired because of too much work, school, responsibilities, stress, not sleeping enough, etc., etc. Something I\u2019m sure you can relate to.\n\nThen I found a great formula that gave me more natural energy, all day long. And it improved my mental focus as well.\n\nTake a look at this short video and see if you can benefit as well.\n\nVIDEO: How To \u201cInstantly\u201d Get Energized & Feel Younger \u00bb\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895706102031552\n\nhttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/esoc-clw082815.php\n\nhttp://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-may-cause-gout\n\nhttp://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/5/1015.short\n\nhttp://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/186223/reload=0;jsessionid=CzWm7s65jDRhoHPFzX4K.10\n\nhttp://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/8/2047.short#\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4206198/\n\nhttp://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/drug-facts/caffeine/",

    "content": "This article is about increasing your energy levels. Unfortunately, when people have low energy \u2026 whether it\u2019s in the morning or later in the afternoon, they go for something that gives them a quick boost of energy \u2013 which is typically something with sugar or caffeine\u2026 or BOTH!\n\nThe good news is that this works\u2026 temporarily!\n\nThe bad news is that this ends up crashing you later and you\u2019ll end up even more tired because the sugar and/or caffeine causes an imbalance in your hormones.\n\nAnd as you may know from any of my previous articles\u2026\n\nHormones Control Everything\n\nNow, do this every day (sugar and/or caffeine), maybe 2-3x daily \u2026 Week after week \u2026 And now you\u2019ll have major hormonal issues causing\n\nhigh cortisol levels (the stress hormone)\n\ndecrease in testosterone for men\n\nincrease in cholesterol and triglycerides\n\nmood changes with higher levels of anxiety, irritation and even depression\n\ninflammation and acidity (this means pain)\n\nweight gain (especially belly fat)\n\nYou might be thinking \u201cno way, all of these problems?!!\u201d \u2026 Yes, when this is done even 3-4x weekly, it becomes chronic and your body NEEDS the sugar and/or caffeine rush just to feel \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nRemember, both sugar and caffeine act as DRUGS in your body \u2013 not good!\n\nIn the below video Dr. Oz mentions how you should start your day with a good breakfast that\u2019s high in both protein and fiber, to prevent an energy crash later in the day. This is a good start.\n\nI like to also add in some healthy fats as well. Some options would be:\n\negg omelet with vegetables like spinach and/or beans and/or fruit\n\nsweet potatoes with some coconut oil\n\nsome cottage cheese or Greek yogurt, mixed with almonds or walnuts\n\nMy professional athlete clients will have grass-fed bison or wild salmon in the morning, with coconut oil and/or beans and/or vegetables.\n\nYou want a slow-burning breakfast, to give you sustained energy throughout the day. Just remember to have some protein, fiber, and fat\u2026 and NOT the typical \u201chigh carb\u201d breakfast.\n\nMy Three Favorites For Long-Term Energy & Longevity\n\nThere are three things that I make sure all my private clients do when wanting to maximize their energy levels \u2013 both physically and mentally:\n\nFIRST \u2013 The most important is to make sure you drink lots of water! Dehydration is a major cause of fatigue.\n\nDrink at least half your body weight in ounces. So if you weigh 150 lbs, drink a minimum of 75 oz. daily. Try to add in a little bit of lemon juice to help alkalize your body and curb your appetite.\n\nSECOND \u2013 Breathe deeply. When tired, your body is low in oxygen. This is in fact, why you yawn when you\u2019re tired \u2013 your body is trying to take in more oxygen.\n\nSo start the day by taking some deep breaths, holding and exhaling slowly. Do this 10x in a row, 3x daily.f\n\nTHIRD \u2013 Utilize More Natural Energy, 2x daily. This was designed to increase oxygen to your cells, improve mitochondria function create REAL long-term energy, and improves memory and cognition.\n\nYou can watch the short video about how to have real, all-day energy without any negative crashes or hormonal imbalances.\n\nStay away from sugars and caffeine, they deplete your energy levels in the long run.\n\nStart the day with a slow-burning breakfast consisting of protein, fiber and some fat.\n\nDrink lots of water and stay hydrated.\n\nBreathe deeply, 3x daily.\n\nUtilize More Natural Energy, 2x daily \u2013 morning and early afternoon.",

    "content": "Do you drink coffee, tea, soda or \u201cenergy drinks\u201d? If yes, then make sure you read today\u2019s important article!\n\nFACT: Did you know that caffeine is the most used, popular and ABUSED DRUG on the planet?8 The interesting thing is that most people don\u2019t even consider caffeine a \u201cdrug\u201d.\n\nMost people think that caffeine is \u201cnatural\u201d. Yes, it is \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d in certain substances, such as coffee or tea.\n\nBut by no means is caffeine \u201cnatural\u201d, nor is it good for your body.\n\nHealth Problems With Caffeine\n\nCaffeine, IF used \u201cas needed\u201d (when you\u2019re very tired) and occasionally (maybe 3x a week), is fine. Maybe one cup of coffee or about 100-150 mgs worth of caffeine. NOT every day, but 3-4x weekly\u2026\n\nHowever, any more than that and your body starts to deal with the negative effects, such as:\n\nBlood pressure problems1,2\n\nBreast tissue cysts in women4\n\nInsomnia and poor sleep5\n\nBlood sugar problems and poor carbohydrate metabolism6\n\nWrinkles and poor collagen production in your skin7\n\n\u2026 and many other problems.\n\nThe WORST Problem Of All\n\nHowever, in my PERSONAL opinion, the WORST problem with caffeine consumption is the negative change in your hormones due to the RISE in your \u201cstress hormone\u201d called, cortisol!\n\nAt the end of the day, the elevation in this stress hormone is the cause of many of the above-mentioned negative effects.\n\nWe already live in stressful times, with lots of responsibilities and many of us aren\u2019t sleeping well.\n\nCaffeine is just making everything else much worse and it\u2019s accelerating the aging process!\n\nWhy We Like Caffeine So Much\n\nSo, why do you or anyone even take caffeine products?\u2026\n\nYou can have \u201cdecaf\u201d coffee or tea. It tastes the same. So, it\u2019s not about \u201ctaste\u201d.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s simply because you like how it makes you FEEL. We like the extra energy levels \u2014 both physical and mental.\n\nAdditionally, caffeine increases dopamine levels slightly. Dopamine is known as the \u201cpleasure chemical\u201d. So, another reason caffeine makes us \u201chappy\u201d.\n\nHowever, after continued use, your adrenal glands become overworked, cortisol levels increase, dopamine receptors become desensitized and caffeine is NO LONGER making your \u201cenergized and happy\u201d\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s now just keeping you \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nMany times you have a mid-day \u201ccaffeine crash\u201d, which means MORE caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, etc.). Thus, why it\u2019s addictive.\n\nAnd when you get off, the opposite happens \u2014 you\u2019re super tired and depressed!\n\nSo now that you know, let\u2019s talk about better, safer, and healthier alternatives\u2026\n\nHow To Increase Your Energy Levels & Feel Good, WITHOUT Caffeine!\n\nThe good news is that with the correct combination of natural ingredients, you\u2019ll get MANY MORE BENEFITS, without any of the negatives of caffeine.\n\nThat means NO withdrawals. NO addiction. NO crashes.\n\nSo here\u2019s a list of my favorite ingredients for you to use for increased energy levels, improved cognition and anti-aging purposes:\n\nRhodiola Rosea \u2014 great for adrenal fatigue and coming off of caffeine. Improves your mood and helps you deal with stress much better.\n\nAniracetam \u2014 an amazingly safe \u201cnootropic\u201d. This means improved cognition, memory and brainpower.\n\nDMAE \u2014 great for mental clarity and alertness. Also beneficial for skin rejuvenation\n\nNADH & CoQ10 \u2014 increases ATP and mitochondria production, which dramatically increases your energy levels, naturally.\n\nAcetyl L-Carnitine \u2014 improves cognition, and energy levels, is great for the heart and reduces stress\n\nAs you can see, lots of benefits. The only \u201cproblem\u201d is that you have to take too buy too many products, take too many pills and it can get expensive.\n\nThis is a challenge that I personally faced myself.\n\nMy Personal Favorite Solution\n\nImagine getting all the benefits of caffeine and MORE, without the negative side effects and as an added bonus, you\u2019ll look and feel younger too! \u2026\n\nPlus, all you did was just take ONE pill daily, which combined all these scientifically proven ingredients, along with a few other key vitamins and minerals.\n\nMany years ago I was always tired because of too much work, school, responsibilities, stress, not sleeping enough, etc., etc. Something I\u2019m sure you can relate to.\n\nThen I found a great formula that gave me more natural energy, all day long. And it improved my mental focus as well.\n\nTake a look at this short video and see if you can benefit as well.\n\nVIDEO: How To \u201cInstantly\u201d Get Energized & Feel Younger \u00bb\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895706102031552\n\nhttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/esoc-clw082815.php\n\nhttp://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-may-cause-gout\n\nhttp://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/5/1015.short\n\nhttp://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/186223/reload=0;jsessionid=CzWm7s65jDRhoHPFzX4K.10\n\nhttp://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/8/2047.short#\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4206198/\n\nhttp://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/drug-facts/caffeine/",

    "content": "NOTE: Please make sure to read my comments at the end of this infographic. I discuss the \u201csecret\u201d to having more energy, as described in my video. And please stop having caffeinated drinks \u2013 they are robbing your energy levels, which I discuss at the bottom of this article.\n\n\u201cLow Energy\u201d is the #1 complaint I hear from people for over 20 years. People don\u2019t realize just how important it is to have \u201cmore natural energy\u201d because we have slowly gotten used to being tired and fatigued\u2026 feeling \u201cold and run down\u201d\u2026 not having the same mental or physical energy we once used to.\n\n\u2026 and you know what, everyone simply says \u201cwell, I\u2019m just getting OLDER\u2026 I\u2019m busy\u2026 I have a lot of stress\u201d\n\nSadly, these are the excuses I used to give myself.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be that way at all. These days I have just as much energy and probably MORE than I did 10 or even 20 years ago and you can too!\n\nAs I described in my video, the key to energy is OXYGEN. So, here are some simple tips for increasing the oxygen to your brain and muscles:\n\nBreathe better! Take deeper breaths, do breathing exercises, yoga, meditation, etc\u2026 all help improve breathing. Most of us are shallow breathers, which by the way \u2013 leads to health problems\n\nExercise aerobically (cardiovascular)! You need to do cardio and do so every day. You can do something fast, 10-15 minutes of jogging, running, etc. Or, do something slower but longer for 30-45 minutes. Do whatever you\u2019re able to do based on your current fitness level and make sure you try to PUSH more, by doing the same \u201cwork\u201d, but in less time \u2013 that means FASTER\n\nExercise anaerobically (lifting weights)! The bigger your muscles, the more oxygen they will carry and hold throughout the day. Cardio is good for your heart, but lifting weights is good for the rest of your body.\n\nEat green vegetables! The \u201cgreens\u201d can help deliver more oxygen to your cells due to photosynthesis. Try to have them raw or steamed. Please don\u2019t cook them and then have it with sauces and oils. Keep it natural.\n\nTake specific herbs and vitamins!f One of the most effective \u201coxygen\u201d builders and energy enhancers is found in More Natural Energy. It\u2019s something professional athletes use, as well as regular people like you and myself. It improve oxygen to EVERY CELL in your body.\n\nSo, there you have it. Watch this short video for more details and please do something about this TODAY because when you have more natural energy, you get more work done, make more money and be able to enjoy your free time as well, since you feel young!\n\n\u2026 oh, one last thing \u2013 STOP having caffeinated drinks! That means NO MORE coffee, \u201cenergy drinks\u201d, or similar products. They do the opposite by reducing oxygen and killing your adrenal glands and lowering your thyroid levels.",

    "content": "Last week my niece stayed with me for a couple of days for some work related stuff. Every time I saw her, she said how \u201ctired\u201d she was \u2013 this included first thing in the morning.\n\nI said to her \u201cyou\u2019re only 20 years old, why are you always so tired?!!\u201d\n\nShe replied and said \u201cI know\u2026 I\u2019m just so stressed all the time with work, school and life\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything, but I was thinking \u201cwell, it\u2019s only going to get worse as you get older because you\u2019ll have a lot more responsibilities later on in life\u201d. And then I was thinking how most people\u2019s complaints, regardless of their age or sex, is being fatigued and tired and how most of the cause is due to \u201cbeing stressed\u201d.\n\nAnd as the saying goes, \u201cstress kills\u201d\u2026 And it really does because it causes lots of negative hormonal changes in your body.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to reveal the 4 most powerful and clinically proven ingredients that will help\n\nimprove your memory and focus\n\nwhile reducing your stress at the same time.\n\nThe reason stress is bad is because it disrupts multiple biochemical pathways:\n\nincluding cortisol production (a primary stress hormone)\n\nadrenal production (a primary cause of fatigue)\n\npro-inflammatory enzyme production (a primary cause of disease)\n\nand neurotransmitter production (a primary cause of brain aging).1-3\n\nSadly, an estimated 80%\u201390% of visits to primary care physicians are now related to the effects of stress.4\n\nYou may not be able to stop stress, but for longevity and health reasons, you need to give your body specific nutrients to help manage and reduce \u201cstress side-effects\u201d.\n\nThis way you\u2019ll have more energy, improve your mind and memory, sleep better and look younger!\n\nSo here are the 4 clinically proven ingredients:\n\n1- Bacopa extract (50% bacopa glycosides)\n\nIt is traditionally used to help support memory and concentration while easing stress and tension. It is thought to help nourish neurons while restoring depleted synaptic activity and is one of the most revered herbs for brain health\n\n2- Sensoril\u00ae Ashwagandha extract\n\nIt counters some of the oxidative damage generated by nervous tension and stress.5 Clinical trials have shown a 26% reducing of the stress hormone, cortisol \u2026. while also improving blood sugar levels and lipid profiles.6\n\nStudies have also shown an improvement in energy, sleep, healthy outlook and well-being, as well as diminished fatigue.7\n\n3- Sharp-PS\u00ae Green Phosphatidylserine (Soy Free)\n\nIt is required for normal cellular structure and function. Brain tissues are especially rich in phosphatidylserine (PS), but aging causes a decline in the PS content of cells throughout the body.\n\nResearch has shown that in addition to improving neural function, PS enhances energy metabolism in all cells, memory, concentration, learning and word choice.8,9\n\nAnother major benefit to using PS is that it significantly modulates cortisol levels, resulting in a more relaxed state.\n\nIt is an amino acid that can be converted in the brain and in the adrenal glands to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (adrenaline) hormones that are depleted by stress, overwork and certain drugs.\n\nBy replenishing norepinephrine in the brain, mental energy levels will be improved.\n\nAlso, the N-Acetyl version of Tyrosine is more stable and soluble, thus resulting in greater bioavailability and effectiveness.\n\n\u2026 so these are the 4 best ingredients for reducing your stress hormones, resulting in higher energy levels.\n\nNow, there are a few other very important, clinically proven and safe ingredients that will dramatically increase full-body energy levels \u2014 both your body AND brain. Here\u2019s my favorite formula that contains all of them\u2026\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nComp Biochem Physiol Part D Genomics Proteomics. 2012 Jun;7(2):161-71.\n\nScience. 2010 Dec 3;330(6009):1349-54.\n\nJ Clin Sleep Med. 2007 Dec 15;3(7):681-8\n\nhttp://www.stress.org/americas-1-health-problem\n\nNat Rev Neurosci. 2009;10(3):199-210.\n\nObes Rev. 2009 Nov;10 Suppl 2:37-45.\n\nScience. 2010 Dec 3;330(6009):1349-54\n\nPhosphatidylserine: Number One Brain Booster.

    "content": "Personally, I think one of the biggest problems in life that causes you to NOT be happy or achieve your goals is LACK OF ENERGY and basically, being tired all the time.\n\nIf you had more energy,\n\nyou\u2019d get more work done\u2026\n\nyou\u2019d get MORE out of your relationships\u2026 you\u2019d socialize more, play with your kids, have more fun on the weekends, etc.\n\nyou\u2019d be more productive in life and thus\u2026\n\nYou\u2019d be happier at the end of the each day because you had a FULL day! In fact, one of the biggest complaints people have when it comes to their health is, \u201clack of energy\u201d.\n\nAnd this is why the most used and ABUSED drug on the planet is caffeine!\n\nThis is why beverages such as coffee, tea and \u201cenergy\u201d drinks are the biggest money-makers \u2014 everyone is drinking them to start AND get through their days. In fact, people don\u2019t even see caffeine as a drug. They think it\u2019s just a \u201csupplement\u201d.\n\nSo \u201cenergy drinks\u201d and \u201cenergy supplements\u201d are just another delivery mechanism for caffeine. In the old days, people would just take straight caffeine pills such as No-Doz or Vivarin.\n\nIt\u2019s cheap and effective and yes, this is what I would do when I was younger to get through my long days at work and medical school.\n\nI mean, it was like 6-7 days a week of 12-14 hour days. It was horrible. But I didn\u2019t know how else to get through the day. When you\u2019re young, your body can take the abuse.\n\nUnfortunately, over time I noticed\n\nmy sleep was horrible,\n\nI was irritable all the time,\n\nmy sex drive was lower,\n\nand worse of all, I was still TIRED all the time after the INITIAL energy \u201chigh\u201d from the caffeine. In fact, after a while I needed the caffeine just say \u201cnormal\u201d. I wasn\u2019t even getting energized anymore.\n\nAnd THIS is the problem with caffeine! \u2014 Your body quickly adapts after a few days or weeks. Your adrenal glands get burned out and you have \u201cadrenal fatigue\u201d.\n\nYour stress hormones such as Cortisol goes sky-high, which causes negative imbalances with all of your \u201cyouth\u201d hormones.\n\nyour testosterone drops\u2026\n\nyour thyroid and metabolism slows down\u2026\n\nyour insulin levels go up\u2026\n\nyou have high blood pressure\u2026\n\nyour dopamine levels (your happy neurotransmitter) and receptors don\u2019t work very well\n\nand the end result is accelerated aging! Both physically AND mentally. And, this is what happened to me!\n\nSo, I had to find a safe and long-term solution. The first thing I did was slowly get off anything with caffeine.\n\nI did NOT do this \u201ccold-turkey\u201d or abruptly because caffeine is a drug. Your body is addicted to it, no differently than cocaine. In fact, cocaine was the original ingredient in Coca-Cola\n\nWhen cocaine became illegal, they needed to find a \u201clegal\u201d alternative and that\u2019s when Coca-Cola switched over to caffeine!\n\nAnyway, as I was getting off the caffeine, I started using natural herbs to help FIX my bodies caffeine-induced problems.\n\nI had to fix the 7 energy pathways, which I discuss in detail in my earlier article. You can Click Here to read about this article.\n\nImproving Dopamine levels \u2014 which improves your mood and cognition.\n\nReducing Stress Hormones (Cortisol) \u2014 which reducing aging.\n\nIncrease Mitochondria \u2014 which increases energy to every cell in your body.\n\nBoost Acetylcholine Levels \u2014 which improves muscle control, sleep and brain function.\n\nIncrease ATP Production \u2014 which improves cellular and \u201cwhole-body\u201d energy levels.\n\nImprove & Increase Oxygen uptake\n\nUtilized Nootropics \u2014 which helps optimize brain function and physical performance.\n\nWhen I made these improvements, not my energy levels go up and STAY up, but\n\nMy mood dramatically improved\n\nMy memory and cognition was so much better\n\nI looked and felt so much younger\n\nOf course, this took a little bit of time\u2026 about 2-3 months, since my body had to ALSO \u201cdetox\u201d from the caffeine.\n\nMy only regret is that I didn\u2019t start utilizing this proven formula earlier.\n\nBut as the saying goes, better late than never.

They wake up tired, don\u2019t have enough energy for the gym, their sleep is abnormal, can\u2019t focus at work, etc., etc\u2026 Maybe something you can relate to?\n\nSomeone who was listening to the conversation then said \u201cjust take some vitamins, they\u2019ll give you lots of energy\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, That\u2019s Not Accurate!\n\nThe truth is that vitamins do not directly serve as a source of energy, but they aid the enzymes that generate energy from the FOODS you eat \u2014 such as proteins, carbohydrates and fats.\n\nThus, they play a major role in helping out in the chemical reactions that leads to the generation of energy.\n\nSo it\u2019s foods + vitamins = MORE ENERGY\n\nBut taking vitamins by themselves, in the wrong combination may cause LESS energy due to imbalances. More on this in a minute\u2026\n\nAs you know, there are dozens of vitamins\u2026 so, which are the best and in what amount?\n\nB1 helps form adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which every cell of the body uses for energy.\n\nB2 helps build red blood cells. Women who are anemic, need more of this vitamin. This also turns your pee bright yellow. It works with B6 for energy metabolism.\n\nB3 works in combination with CoQ10, to optimize mitochondria \u2013 which is the \u201cpowerhouse of energy\u201d.\n\nB5 helps release energy from sugars, starches, and fats.\n\nB6 is important for protein metabolism.\n\nB7 \u2013 Biotin boosts your metabolism and allows your muscles to contract better. It\u2019s also important for hair, nails and skin.\n\nB12 helps increase your metabolism (but too much, will also increase your appetite).\n\nC helps in the synthesis of carnitine, which helps utilize fats for energy.\n\nD3 is vitally important. It\u2019s formed from the sun. It interacts with the sleep hormone, Melatonin. It increases mental energy.\n\nSo these are the most effective. You\u2019ll notice most of them being the \u201cB Vitamins\u201d, which as stated earlier \u2014 help turn the foods you eat into more usable energy.\n\nThe main problem is that you can\u2019t just go take a bunch of vitamins or a \u201cB Complex\u201d vitamin and expect to have more energy.\n\nThere is a REAL SCIENCE with the ratios and dosages!\n\nOtherwise, if you take too much of one, it\u2019ll create a deficiency in another vitamin and you\u2019ll have even less energy and more problems. Does this make sense?\u2026\n\nMy Personal Favorite Solution\n\nAdditionally, if you want more energy both mentally AND physically, you\u2019ll need more than just vitamins. There are a few very effective and safe herbs and amino acids that can dramatically boost your energy levels.\n\nMany years ago I was always tired because of too much work, school, responsibilities, stress, not sleeping enough, etc., etc. Something I\u2019m sure you can relate to.\n\nThen I found a great formula that gave me more natural energy, all day long.
