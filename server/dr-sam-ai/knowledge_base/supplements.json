    "content": "Most experts agree that proper blood circulation is a key factor in health, fitness, and longevity. Unfortunately, most people over the age of 30 suffer from poor blood flow.\n\nTypical symptoms are cold hands and feet, headaches, fatigue, memory problems, poor sleep, muscle loss, and lowered libido for both men and women, causing erectile dysfunction in men.\n\nThere are a number of different ways to improve your blood flow \u2014 such as diet, exercise, massage, stretching, and taking supplements. This is what I\u2019m going to discuss in today\u2019s article \u2013 the 10 best vitamins, minerals, and herbs, that are clinically proven to help improve blood flow and help strengthen your arteries and blood vessels.\n\nI\u2019ll do a quick summary of these ingredients in today\u2019s article.\n\nCarnitine helps your body produce energy and plays an important role in heart and brain function, muscle movement, and many other body processes. It\u2019s especially important for improving blood flow to your brain and heart.\n\nMost people have heard of the cheaper form, which is L-carnitine. However, what\u2019s important to note is that there are different forms of Carnitine and the best are:\n\nGlycine Propionyl L-Carnitine (GPLC)\n\nA specific combination of these 3 forms has been clinically validated to improve blood flow. Again, I\u2019ll give you more details in a minute.\n\nMost people do not obtain adequate amounts of magnesium in their diets and this is unfortunate because magnesium is one of the body\u2019s most important minerals. It is required as a cofactor in hundreds of enzymatic processes within cells.\n\nIn regards to improving blood flow, what\u2019s important to note is that magnesium helps:\n\nRelax smooth muscles within blood vessels, which improves blood circulation\n\nBalance out calcium and thus, prevent calcium buildup in the arteries and vessels\n\nSimilar to carnitine, there are different forms of Magnesium and each has a specific function. The optimal blend contains Magnesium Glycinate Chelate, Magnesium Citrate, Magnesium Aspartate, and Magnesium Oxide.\n\nN-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC)\n\nOne of my favorite supplements is an amino acid called, NAC. It helps:\n\nDetox your liver and kidney\n\nRemoves heavy metals and toxins\n\nBoosts your immune system by increasing Glutathione\n\nAll of this improves circulation.\n\nNattokinase is an enzyme (a protein that speeds up reactions in the body) that is extracted from a popular Japanese food called natto. It\u2019s nature\u2019s very own natural blood thinner, which helps support healthy blood pressure and improved circulation.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s very special about it is that it fights fibrin buildup, which is a fibrous mesh that reduces blood flow, which can over time, lead to heart failure and a heart attack.\n\nDo you know how Aspirin was first discovered? \u2026 It was in nature from the White Willow Extract, which is the original (or natural form of) aspirin because it contains a natural ingredient called \u201csalicin\u201d that\u2019s similar to aspirin, but without the usual negative side-effects.\n\nUsed in small dosages, it also helps naturally thin the blood and improves blood flow. It also acts as a natural anti-inflammatory.\n\nThe antioxidants in tea promote cardiovascular health and improve circulation. This is true for both black tea and green tea.\n\nBlack tea improves blood vessel health1, while green tea has been associated with a lower rate of coronary artery disease.2 Both have been shown to improve circulation.1,2\n\nMake sure you get the \u201cextract\u201d version, which is high in Polyphenols and antioxidants.\n\nVitamin D, E, and K2-7\n\nFinally, 3 of the best vitamins for improving blood flow are\n\nD3 \u2013 which should be taken for overall health benefits, including blood flow\n\nE \u2013 it helps reduce inflammation and thins the blood. In fact, in a clinical study, it was found that there was a nearly 50% reduction in heart attacks in people who take Vit E daily.\n\nK2-7 \u2013 a special form of Vitamin K, which takes excess calcium OUT of your blood vessels and puts it into your bones, where it\u2019s needed.\n\nSo there you have it, the best ingredients and supplements, which are clinically proven to help improve your blood flow and circulation, while also strengthening your vessels and making them more flexible and pliable.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s important to note is that there is a special synergy when these ingredients are combined. More positive effects and benefits, at a much lower dosage.\n\nYou can get more details about this in this article \u2014 so you can save yourself time and lots of money, while dramatically improving the benefits.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/content/104/2/151\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226633\n\nCambridge Heart Antioxidant Study (CHAOS)",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/best-vitamin-to-boost-energy-levels/",
    "content": "Today I have one very important topic: is there any specific vitamin that helps with increasing energy levels? How about Vitamin D and Vitamins B?\n\nPerfect Vitamin D&K is very important for energy levels. It contains a specific form of Vitamins D3 and K2. Most people are deficient in these two fat-soluble vitamins.\n\nHowever, Vitamin D isn\u2019t even a vitamin. It\u2019s actually a HORMONE and that\u2019s why it is so powerful.\n\nVitamin B For More Energy?\n\nSo, speaking strictly about Vitamins \u2013 B vitamins are very important.\n\nHowever, these vitamins don\u2019t give energy directly, the way a hormone does or a drug like caffeine. They work with your FOOD to optimize pathways to increase and maximize energy levels.\n\nSimply stated, vitamins allow your food to be better utilized for energy levels.\n\nYou might consider taking a daily B-complex supplement. Especially if you exercise regularly and have higher stress levels.\n\nBetter, All-In-One Solution\n\nYears ago I had a product called More Natural Energy.\n\nIt consisted of the correct blend of B vitamins, plus other important ingredients such as:\n\nNootropics \u201caka \u2013 smart drugs\u201d\n\nAcetylcholine optimizers\n\nMitochondria optimizers\n\nAnd other important \u201cenergy producers\u201d\n\nAnd it contained NO caffeine, which is very important.\n\nHowever, after a successful decade, I decided to remove the B complex vitamins. They took up too much valuable space. And, didn\u2019t really do that much.\n\nLike I said, B vitamins don\u2019t produce energy directly.\n\nSo instead, I increased the dosages of the other ingredients and added new ones.\n\nThe new product name is now called, Body-Brain Energy and it\u2019s super powerful and again, NO caffeine.\n\nONE Vitamin For Energy Levels\n\nSo, circling back to the ONE vitamin that does increase energy levels by itself and doesn\u2019t require food\u2026 is a natural coenzyme derived from vitamin B3 (niacin) and it\u2019s called, NADH (Reduced B-Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)\n\nIt\u2019s one of the new ingredients I added to Body-Brain Energy over a decade ago.\n\nNADH is essential for basic metabolism, respiration, the breakdown of sugars and fats, and most importantly, the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the primary energy molecule in our cells.\n\nNADH also plays an important role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters in the brain\u2026 These are important brain chemicals such as dopamine which help increase emotional drive. NADH is powerful.\n\nI would say 5 mgs daily in the morning is a good starting point. The maximum is 10 mg.\n\nMaximize The Benefits\n\nI also added Rhodiola Extract in Body-Brain Energy because it helps promote ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and CP (creatine phosphate) in the mitochondria.\n\nAnd it works synergistically with NADH, so it\u2019s a great combination to take to maximize ATP production.\n\nSo you might want to consider taking both of these together.\n\n120 mg of Rhodiola Extract\n\nFirst thing in the morning.\n\nYou can take second dose midday, but for sure not close to bedtime.\n\nThere are many other factors that increase physical energy levels and mental focus. My favorite solution is Body-Brain Energy. Take a look at the ingredients and see how you might benefit.\n\nRemember, the more energy you have, the more productive you\u2019ll be, you\u2019ll enjoy more of life, and you\u2019ll be happier and more fulfilled!\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Not to mention a huge placebo effect and thus, how powerful your mind is at controlling your mood.\n\nHormones and neurotransmitters\n\nAre all major factors, and I don\u2019t think any single ONE is more important than another.\n\nGo outside every morning and get some sunlight and go for a 15-30 min walk outside. This resets important hormones and gets Vitamin D in your system. At the same time, start your morning by taking a specific, vegan Vitamin D3 + K2 supplement such as Perfect Vitamin D&K.\n\nTry to reduce and eliminate all processed foods, sugars, and artificial sweeteners. They mess up your gut bacteria. At the same time, make sure you take probiotics. In fact, there are 3 clinically proven probiotics specific for improving mood and they are found in a product called ProVanax \u2026 Which also contains specific herbs and vitamins which help support healthy, youthful levels of key neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine.\n\nYou must support a healthy inflammatory response.\n\nBut in the meantime, make sure you take fish oil daily or eat wild-caught salmon, 3x weekly.\n\nAnd take a potent all-in-one supplement called Inflame & Pain Relief, which helps support healthy and youthful inflammatory responses.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...

    "content": "If you have poor blood flow, it negatively affects your ENTIRE body \u2013 brain, heart, muscles, organs, and extremities \u2013 such as hands, feet, and sexual organs (penis & clitoris).\n\nOf course, a healthy lifestyle such as a proper diet, regular exercise program, and stress management is always important.\n\nHowever, is there a way to speed up the process?\u2026\n\nEspecially if you don\u2019t want to or have the time, money, or desire to make big improvements in your lifestyle?\n\nThe answer is \u201cyes\u201d and this includes taking specific supplements.\n\nHowever, today it\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m going to focus on the best vitamins and minerals for promoting healthy blood flow.\n\nAnd in a future video, I\u2019ll discuss the best and most potent herbal extracts and amino acids.\n\nVitamins For Blood Flow & Circulation\n\nVitamin D is very important for many things in the body, and healthy circulation is one of them. However, D3 should be taken with Vitamin K, more specifically K2.\n\nAnd this is because Vitamin D can actually increase calcium deposits in the arteries \u2013 which is NOT what you want. This is where Vitamin K2 comes in and helps support healthy calcium metabolism in the bones and not the arteries.\n\nVitamin C is another super vitamin that I think everyone should be taking for healthy skin, hair, muscles, arterial function, immune support and so much more.\n\nLastly, I would also add Vitamin E. It has many benefits, one of them being a natural blood thinner.\n\nThere are other vitamins, such as the B-complex supplement. It\u2019s not as powerful as the other vitamins for blood flow support, but it\u2019s inexpensive so why not.\n\nMinerals For Blood Flow & Circulation\n\nIn addition to the vitamins I just mentioned, I suggest you take a mineral called Magnesium. Like Vit D and C, it has so many health benefits and most of us are lacking in it.\n\nUnfortunately, there are lots of different forms of magnesium and it can get confusing. I suggest you do a mix, such as the patented MAGNA Max\u2122 Blend, which consists of TRAACS\u00ae Magnesium Glycinate, Chelate, Citrate, Aspartate & Oxide\n\nAs far as the best dosages and so forth, I use one specific product with the best dosages and forms.

I like it above 50 as the minimum.\n\nNow, keep in mind that you should NOT go out and just supplement with any vitamin D.\n\nFirst, it needs to be Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) \u2013 NOT regular D or D2 (ergocalciferol).\n\nSecondly, Vitamin D3 works directly with vitamin K2 [more specifically as MK-7 (trans-menaquinone-7)] to help optimize both absorbability and safety.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t take regular K or K1, or the synthetic K3 \u2013 It must be K2, specifically as MK-7 (trans menaquinone-7)\n\nSo, don\u2019t take either of these vitamins by themselves.

    "content": "Did you know that vitamin D can cause heart attacks?\n\nYup, it can cause plaque buildup in your arteries, which reduces blood flow and could eventually lead to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nI mention this because I was at a dinner party recently and that\u2019s what this guy was telling me.\n\nHe said that he had low levels of Vitamin D after doing a blood test in 2025. So, he started taking a vitamin D supplement.\n\nBut after a few months, he stopped because a friend of his told him how vitamin D can cause a heart attack because of calcium buildup in the arteries. He said that\u2019s what his doctor told him.\n\nAnd, if that wasn\u2019t enough, he saw a few YouTube videos that said the same thing.\n\nKnowing that I\u2019m in the health field, he then said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you already know this\u2026 and you\u2019re not stupid enough to take Vitamin D, right?\u2026\u201d\n\nWell, I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer the guy since I just met him.\n\nShould I be my usual blunt self? I may offend him.\n\nOr, shall I be politically correct?\n\nHonestly, I hate these situations since I\u2019m just an open guy, I hate walking on eggshells worrying about what I say or don\u2019t say or if I\u2019m going to offend someone with my point of view or in this situation, the truth!\n\nSo I just told him, \u201cYes, I do take Vitamin D and lots of it. Having optimal Vitamin D levels is super important for your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nI\u2019ve also done a full calcium score test and it was perfect. I also did an MRI of my heart and arteries, again \u2013 zero plaque buildup. BUT, you have to do it correctly. If you want, I can share with you?...\u201d\n\nHe then said, \u201cOh man, it\u2019s just a matter of time before you have a heart attack\u201d.\n\nAt this point, I didn\u2019t want to get into an argument with him because had already made up his mind. So, I didn\u2019t bother teaching him how all of this works.\n\nI offered to help, but he didn\u2019t care\u2026 So I just moved on.\n\nHowever, allow me to give you more details since I think you\u2019re more open-minded and care about the truth based on both clinical studies and real-world empirical evidence.\n\nVitamin D3 and Calcium:\n\nSome studies show that high doses of Vitamin D3 can lead to too much calcium in the blood, potentially causing artery hardening.\n\nConversely, calcium can improve bone density, but too much can increase heart risks.\n\nUnderstanding the Risks:\n\nWhile Vitamin D3 is essential, over-supplementation can lead to hypercalcemia (high calcium levels), which many doctors warn about.\n\nHowever, many people, including myself, have high Vitamin D3 levels without elevated calcium. This suggests that current medical guidelines may be flawed.\n\nThe Role of Vitamin K2:\n\nVitamin D3 works with Vitamin K2 to regulate calcium in the body. While D3 helps absorb calcium, K2 directs it to the right places\u2014bones and teeth, not arteries.\n\nSupplementing with K2 is crucial to prevent artery calcification and maintain cardiovascular health.\n\nHow This Works \u2013 Key Proteins:\n\nOsteocalcin: Helps bind calcium to bones, promoting bone strength.\n\nMatrix GLA Protein (MGP): Prevents calcium from depositing in arteries, keeping them flexible.\n\nAction Steps For You:\n\nIf you\u2019re taking Vitamin D3, consider adding Vitamin K2.\n\nLook for MK4 and MK7 forms of K2 in supplements. However, MK7 is generally more effective due to its longer half-life and better absorbability.\n\nThe one I use is the patented MenaQ7\u00ae (Natural MK-7; as trans menaquinone-7)\n\nThe ideal ratio is about 2:1. So about 100 mcg or 5000 IU of D3 with 50 mcg of K2, MK-7.\n\nI take Perfect Vitamin D3 + K2 because it has this correct clinically researched ratio.\n\nIt\u2019s also vegan, plant-based and microencapsulated so it\u2019s better absorbed and fresher than the usual cheaper, oil-based versions that most supplement companies have.\n\nMost need just 1 pill a day. So, a bottle will last you 3 months, which comes out to pennies a day. So, it\u2019s a great price with so many amazing health benefits.\n\nNow, I personally take 2 pills daily because that\u2019s what I need to get my Vitamin D levels to the optimal, upper range for maximum health benefits.\n\nIt\u2019s just my genetics. My mom, at age 85 only needs 1 pill daily.\n\nDietary Sources of D3 & K2:\n\nNow, you may also be wondering how you can naturally get more Vitamin D and K, without pills.\n\nWell, vitamin D is made from the sun hitting your skin. So, you\u2019ll need to be in direct sunlight daily for at least 30 minutes or more. Longer on cloudy days.\n\nAlso, your face and hands don\u2019t count. You need it on a large area \u2013 like your legs, and back. In fact, you want to limit the sun on your face and hands to reduce wrinkling, sun damage, and potential skin cancer.\n\nAs far as vitamin K is concerned, you\u2019ll need to eat more animal proteins such as organ meats and whole eggs.\n\nUnfortunately, you\u2019ll need to eat a lot of it to get optimal levels.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re following mostly a plant-based diet, then you\u2019ll need to supplement with Vitamin K2.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

    "content": "So we are halfway through my multi-part article series about the 10 biggest myths and lies about weight loss.\n\nI\u2019ve been taking supplements my entire life it seems. Even as a child, I took my chewable Flintstone vitamins. I\u2019m not sure if they did much, but they tasted good.\n\nHowever, in my early years \u2014 my teens and 20\u2019s \u2013I was always hearing people tell me that \u201csupplements don\u2019t work\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re bad for you\u201d or \u201cyou don\u2019t need supplements, you get everything through food\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve had plenty of doctor friends call supplements \u201cexpensive urine\u201d because they\u2019re just a \u201cwaste of money\u201d.\n\nHowever, over the past decade or so, hundreds of studies have repeatedly shown that\n\nWe are deficient in many vitamins and minerals.\n\nThe correct form and dosage of supplements really do work in improving your health and longevity.\n\nNot to mention, almost all of us are deficient in key nutrients found in HERBS.\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize that over half of the drugs made are based on plants and herbs. They naturally heal you and animals all know this because their diets are heavy in herbs and plants.\n\nWhat\u2019s sad is the \u201cfood pyramid\u201d that you\u2019ve seen, doesn\u2019t even list plants and herbs.\n\nsoil and water depletion\n\npoorly raised animals and meats\n\nand the fact that the older you get, the worse your absorption becomes\n\n\u2026clearly shows why you\u2019re aging faster than you should be.\n\nThus, the lack of nutrients in your diet causes deficiencies which leads to cravings, negative changes in your mood, and behavior, and ultimately \u2013 hormonal imbalances.\n\nNow you know why you have a hard time losing fat, have low energy, crave \u201cbad\u201d foods, are always hungry, lose muscle, don\u2019t sleep well and so on and so forth.\n\nSo YES, you most definitely need supplements\u2026 but only the right ones for YOUR body, YOUR health goals, and what YOUR body is lacking.\n\nHowever, this does lead to another problem \u2014 that many supplements on the market are poorly designed.\n\nThey use the wrong FORM of vitamins and minerals that don\u2019t absorb well.\n\nThey contain low dosages that don\u2019t do anything or you\u2019ll have to take a handful of pills to notice any benefits.\n\nThe herbs don\u2019t contain the correct extracts\u2026 they use cheap, \u201cdead\u201d powders.\n\nAnd thus, all of this means that it really is a waste of money and could potentially even be harmful to your health.\n\nThis is why universities, professional and Olympic athletic teams, and medical offices hire me to formulate specific solutions for them.\n\nThis is why I spend a lot of time, research, and money formulating my own supplements \u2026 because these are products that I use for myself, family, and friends.\n\nAdditionally, I want the people who utilize my formulas to get amazing results and benefits because that means repeat users, they\u2019ll make referrals and will become long-term, loyal clients.\n\nI\u2019m focused on long-term health.\n\nSo yes, you do need supplements and yes, most are poorly designed and don\u2019t work.\n\nIf you want a fat-burning formula that\u2019s designed to\n\nsafely increase your metabolism\n\nand turn on your \u201cfat-burning hormones\u201d\n\nThen click the link below and utilize a proven solution that\u2019s been used by hundreds of thousands of people around the world for almost TWO decades.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to list what I think are the 10 best, clinically proven herbs for supporting healthy blood flow circulation to your brain, organs, muscles, and \u201cextremities\u201d such as hands, feet, and penis for guys.\n\nJust remember that the older we get, the worse the circulation.\n\nAnd poor blood flow means fewer youthful hormones, oxygen, enzymes, and nutrients being delivered throughout your body \u2013 which means, faster aging, and slower healing.\n\nIn addition to these clinically researched herbs, there are also specific vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that also help promote healthy blood flow.\n\nUnlike a good diet or exercise plan, which unfortunately most people have a hard time sticking to.\n\nThe biggest problem with most of us is that the harder it is, the less likely we are going to do it long-term.\n\nAlso, the easier something is, the more likely we\u2019ll do it long-term and thus, get results.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started on the 10 best scientifically proven herbs, and I\u2019m going to give a quick summary of each herb.\n\nHorse Chestnut Extract\n\nHorse chestnut contains bioactive compounds called escin. Studies have shown that escin has veno-protective properties and can combat water retention, and supports healthy inflammation and blood flow.\n\nVeno-protective means it\u2019s beneficial for the veins or venous system in the body. Horse chestnut is especially important for the extremities \u2013 such as hands, feet, and genitals.\n\nMake sure you only get the extract version at 20% concentration.\n\nGinkgo Biloba Extract\n\nThe Ginkgo biloba tree is essentially unchanged for 200 million years and has been used to promote healthy blood flow, primarily to the brain. It\u2019s been used to support memory & cognitive health for centuries.\n\nMake sure to get a Non-GMO version standardized at 24% extract.\n\nBeetroot is high in nitrates, which can be converted into nitric oxide. The vasodilation effect of nitric oxide supports healthy blood flow \u2014 and thus oxygen and nutrient delivery \u2014 to muscles, heart, arteries, and extremities.\n\nAs a reminder, improving nitric oxide is also how drugs like Viagra and Cialis work for improving blood flow for erections in men, as well as supporting healthy blood pressure.\n\nMake sure you get a 10:1 extract\n\nPine Bark Extract Pycnogenol\u00ae\n\nFrench maritime pine bark extract helps inhibit inflammatory factors to help promote circulatory and vascular health, fights oxidative stress, and promotes healthy longevity \u2013 especially to the veins and arteries.\n\nMake sure you get the 65% procyanidins; 97% Dehydroabietic Acid extract\n\nCocoa Flavanols Extract\n\nCocoa flavanol supplements are, you guessed it, made from the ancient super-food cocoa. Yes, the same ingredient in your favorite DARK chocolate, just in a healthier, more concentrated form.\n\nThe flavanols specifically found in cocoa (which are distinct from the cocoa plant) have been shown in over 20 studies, to promote better circulation and support healthy cardiovascular function, brain performance, and memory.\n\nDo you know how Aspirin was first discovered? \u2026 It was in nature from the White Willow Extract, which is the original (or natural form of) aspirin.\n\nIt contains a natural ingredient called \u201csalicin\u201d that\u2019s similar to aspirin. Used in small dosages, it helps promote healthy circulation and inflammatory response.\n\nMake sure to get 25% Salicin extract\n\nGinger has many health benefits and helps support healthy:\n\narterial & vascular function*\n\ncontractile strength of the heart \u2013 which means a stronger heart\n\nATP production in the heart \u2013 which means more energy\n\nMake sure to only use the standardized 15% extract form\n\nThe dark pigment of grapes and berries has important flavonoids. However, grape seed extract is a very concentrated form that supports cardiovascular and brain health. It also acts as a potent free-radical scavenger.\n\nMake sure to use the most potent extra form at 95% procyanidolic oligomers\n\nThis is a small evergreen shrub that can help support healthy inflammation & treat poor blood flow + circulation. *\n\nAn analysis of 20 studies found that a supplement that contained butcher\u2019s broom significantly reduced pain, cramps, and swelling because it can help veins contract, allowing blood to return to the heart, better and faster.\n\nThis puts significantly LESS stress and pressure on the heart.\n\nThis is technically an enzyme, but it\u2019s extremely important because it helps fight Fibrin Buildup\n\nFibrin forms a fibrous mesh that can impede healthy blood flow (not what you want). This decreased blood flow can lead to feelings of fatigue, including your muscles (such as heart and skeletal).\n\nThis is especially important if you\u2019re over the age of 35 for men and 40 for women because as we age, Fibrin can increase and cause blood clots\u2026 which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nNattokinase also acts as a natural blood thinner. It\u2019s good for healthy blood pressure and blood flow.\n\nMake sure you get the NSK-SD version of Nattokinase, which is patented and the only form backed by human clinical studies.\n\nSo, there you have it \u2013 the 10 best herbs that are backed by clinical studies.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m not telling you to go out and buy each of these herbs individually. It\u2019s too much work. It\u2019s also too expensive and extremely inconvenient.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, nobody wants to take 10 or more pills every day, this includes me who is very disciplined.\n\nLuckily, there\u2019s a product called Blood Flow Optimizer that already contains all of these herbal extracts, at the correct dosages and maximum effective extract percentages.\n\nPlus, Blood Flow Optimizer also contains other ingredients such as:\n\nAnd 3 different forms of L Carnitine\n\nIt\u2019s all in ONE, convenient pill that my family and I have been using for over 18+ years.\n\nBest of all, It comes with a one-year guarantee because it has such a long proven track record.\n\nGive Blood Flow Optimizer a try if you want healthy blood flow. And let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to list the 4 primary causes of wrinkles\u2026 As well as the best, easiest, and fastest solutions for reducing wrinkles and possibly preventing them.\n\nI know reducing wrinkles will make you look younger and feel more confident. However, wrinkles and accelerated skin aging also mean that internally you\u2019re not as healthy as you could be.\n\nSo improving your wrinkles will make you look younger and could allow you to live longer too.\n\nWhat Causes Wrinkles?\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the 4 primary causes of wrinkles and skin aging.\n\nI know you may want to jump ahead to the anti-wrinkle solutions in this article. But, the solutions won\u2019t work well if you don\u2019t fix some of the causes of wrinkles.\n\nLoss of Collagen and Elastin: As we age, the production of collagen and elastin, which provide structure and elasticity to the skin, decreases.\n\nSlower Cell Turnover: The rate at which new skin cells are generated and old ones are shed slows down, making the skin appear dull and thin\u2026 thus, revealing the fine lines, which eventually turn into deeper wrinkles.\n\nDecreased Fat: Reduction in the fat layers beneath the skin leads to sagging and more pronounced wrinkles. There\u2019s less fullness. Think of it like a grape that slowly turns into a raisin.\n\nGenetics: Darker, thicker skin such as African American will wrinkle less, than a pale person with red hair, who has less melanin and thinner skin.\n\nSun Exposure: Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun break down collagen fibers and cause the formation of free radicals, which damage skin cells. This is one of the biggest causes of wrinkles.\n\nPollution: Exposure to pollutants can cause oxidative stress, which accelerates skin aging.\n\nDrugs: Popular over-the-counter drugs such as cigarettes and alcohol, can cause damage to collagen and elastin, while also depleting important nutrients such as Vitamin C, which speed up aging.\n\nPoor Nutrition: A diet lacking essential nutrients can weaken the skin\u2019s ability to repair and regenerate. This means highly processed foods, sugars, and seed oils. These foods are all inflammatory, which is a major cause of wrinkles \u2013 which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute.\n\nRepeated Facial Expressions: Over time, repeated movements like smiling, frowning, or squinting create grooves beneath the skin\u2019s surface, which eventually become permanent.\n\nLack of Sleep: Poor sleep quality can prevent the skin from repairing itself effectively, leading to early aging. Remember, when you sleep, your body is healing and repairing. It\u2019s creating all of your youth hormones.\n\nStress: Chronic stress increases cortisol levels, which can break down collagen and elastin. Stress also increases blood sugar, which is inflammatory and is linked to wrinkles.\n\nDehydration: Inadequate hydration can make the skin look dry and more prone to wrinkling. Most people don\u2019t drink enough water. Additionally, your skin can also be dehydrated from the outside \u2013 such as living in a hot, dry climate, versus a topical and humid climate.\n\nFinally and most importantly, we have hormonal factors:\n\nInsulin: High blood sugar and insulin levels, oxidize the entire body, it\u2019s acidic and inflammatory.\n\nGrowth Hormones: Lower growth hormone due to aging and poor sleep, decreases collagen production, and protein synthesis, and accelerates aging.\n\nCortisol: As stated earlier, chronic stress and elevated cortisol and adrenal hormones accelerate aging, increase blood sugar, and cause inflammation.\n\nSex Hormones: A decrease in sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, also accelerate aging and cause faster wrinkling. It also causes a decrease in fluid retention, which causes dehydration\u2026 similar to the grape-to-raisin analogy I gave earlier.\n\nWhen it comes to the causes of wrinkles, genetics aside, anything that\u2019s going to decrease healing and collagen while increasing inflammation is going to increase wrinkles.\n\nSolutions To Reduce & Prevent Wrinkles\n\nNow we can move on to the solutions to help reduce fine lines and wrinkles and hopefully prevent them as we get older.\n\nRemember, the following solutions can\u2019t undo the causes I\u2019ve just mentioned.\n\nHence, don\u2019t expect to prevent wrinkles if you\u2019re going to be in the sun for hours every day, getting a dark, deep tan.\n\nLet\u2019s reduce some of the causes and add in some simple, easy-to-implement solutions.\n\nMost topicals don\u2019t work. It\u2019s a huge market full of lies. The best and most effective are:\n\nRetinoid Creams: They stimulate skin cell turnover and boost collagen production. There are dozens of brands that have retinol, select one that you like. However, if you can get a prescription for Retin-A, that would be ideal. It works faster and it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid: This would be in a topical Serum. Here is a link to the one I use. Both build collagen and increase fullness in the skin reducing fine lines and wrinkles.\n\nSun Block: You need to get in the habit of applying sunblock every day \u2013 especially to your face. I also suggest the top of your hands, neck, and upper chest. If you\u2019re bald, make sure you put on your scalp as well. Or, just wear a hat.\n\nMoisturize: It\u2019s also important to moisturize daily. I try to do it morning and evening. You can use lotions, creams, or light oils if you don\u2019t break out into pimples. If the moisturizer contains ceramides, that\u2019s even better because they keep the skin barrier intact and hydrated.\n\nAs with most things that you hear about, don\u2019t work. However, there are specific supplements that are proven to help your skin:\n\nCollagen Peptides: Make sure to use the hydrolyzed Bovine Peptide. It\u2019s the best one that\u2019s clinically shown to work. I use this one. You need a minimum of 15 GRAMS daily. I take 30 grams. That\u2019s why it has to be the powder form. Taking it in a pill form is a waste and super expensive because you have to take a handful of pills to get the 15 grams.\n\nHyaluronic Acid: It helps the skin retain moisture and plumpness. Take 200 mg daily. I take 400 mg. Here is the one I use.\n\nVitamin C: Vitamin C is needed to form collagen. In fact, taking collagen powder without Vitamin C is almost a waste of time. I suggest taking at least 500 mg to 1000 mg of vitamin C daily. I personally take over 3000 mg daily because it has so many other health benefits.\n\nThese 3 supplements are specific for the skin.\n\nHowever, there are 3 bigger and more powerful causes of winkles, that need to be fixed.\n\nLower Inflammation: Inflammation is horrible for your body, especially your skin and hair. There are a few herbs that support healthy inflammation, such as Turmeric, Ginger, Pine Bark and a few others. I use Inflame & Pain Relief because it contains the best clinically researched ingredients for reducing inflammation.\n\nLower Blood Sugar: High blood sugar is horrible for the body and one reason is that sugar eats away at everything, it\u2019s like acid. High blood sugar also causes inflammation, which I just stated is a cause of wrinkles, hair loss, and pimples. There are a handful of specific ingredients that help lower blood sugar. I use Blood Sugar Optimizer since it contains all of the clinically researched ones.\n\nLower Stress & Cortisol: As stated earlier, high stress & cortisol, accelerate aging, and increase blood sugar and inflammation. Controlling stress can be hard for most of us. That\u2019s why I take specific herbs that help lower stress hormones. The primary ones that are clinically researched are all found in Stress & Cortisol Relief.\n\nAnd none of this matters if you don\u2019t try to live a healthy lifestyle. We all know this. My suggestion would be to make improvements in:\n\nDiet: Eat as natural as possible. This means a very low-processed diet. Such as vegetables, fruits, legumes, yams, healthy protein and fats \u2013 such as fish oil and extra virgin olive oil.\n\nExercise: At the very least, just walk 30 minutes daily. This can be 10-15 minutes, 2-3x daily \u2013 such as first thing in the morning or after meals. That\u2019s all I do.\n\nStress Management: Again, this can be hard. But the most important thing is getting good sleep.\n\nRemember, healthy skin and skin aging make you look younger\u2026 And it means your body is also healthier inside. Remember, your skin is the biggest organ in your body.\n\nPlease don\u2019t passively listen and do nothing. Take action on what you\u2019ve learned today, even if it\u2019s just ONE small improvement.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to scroll down and look at all the important resources I mentioned in the video, below in the description area.",

    "content": "As you age, your body starts to fall apart.\n\nAnd vision problems, which is what I want to write about today.\n\nOf course, genetics plays a big role in everything.\n\nHowever, most of these problems can be reversed or most certainly slowed down, if you take the proper preventive measures. This is especially important if you don\u2019t have the best eye genetics.\n\nThe sooner you start, the better the results and the higher the chance of potentially reversing, avoiding, or slowing down the progressive decline of these age-related problems.\n\nWith that said, I want to quickly reveal the 5 Best, Clinically Proven Ways To Improve Your Eyesight & Vision.\n\n1 \u2013 Eat Specific Foods & Take Your Supplements\n\nMost of us don\u2019t eat the perfect diet filled with a variety of fresh, organic foods, vegetables, and fruits. So you must take supplements that have been shown to help prevent eye degeneration and enhance your vision, especially at night.\n\nVitamins A (and Beta-carotene), C, and E, as well as the mineral zinc, contain antioxidants that can help prevent macular degeneration. It is a condition in which the macula \u2014 the part of the eye that controls central vision \u2014 deteriorates.\n\nMake sure you take additional amounts of these supplements. Plus, add in food sources that contain healthy amounts of these nutrients, which can be found in:\n\nYou\u2019ll notice there are a variety of colors with these foods, which is key.\n\nTake your omega-3 fatty acids as well. I suggest about 2-6 grams daily.\n\nGood food sources would be salmon, flaxseed, and also Krill oil.\n\nI also suggest taking carotenoids, such as lutein, zeaxanthin and astaxanthin. Carotenoids are found in the retina of your eyes. These carotenoids help protect the macula by improving pigment density in that part of the eye, and absorbing ultraviolet and blue light.\n\nThat last bit is especially important, considering how much you\u2019re bombarded with unnatural blue light these days (fluorescent/LED lighting, computer, and phone screens, etc.).\n\n2 \u2013 Control Your Blood Sugar\n\nThis is a major topic in itself.\n\nThis is especially important if you\u2019re overweight and/or have diabetes or prediabetes or a family history of it. And this is because high blood sugar causes damage to the tiny blood vessels in your eyes.\n\nSo, make sure you eat well, exercise, and take supplements that help lower your blood sugar and improve your insulin sensitivity.\n\n3 \u2013 Lower Your Blood Pressure\n\nAnother chronic health condition that causes eye damage, in addition to high blood sugar is high blood pressure.\n\nBoth of these issues cause inflammation to the optic nerve, which can cause pain, poor eyesight especially night vision, and can even lead to complete vision loss if not treated.\n\n4 \u2013 Optimal Cholesterol Levels \u2013 NO Statin Drugs\n\nHigh AND low cholesterol are both linked to cataracts. Even more so, statin drugs, which are prescribed to lower high cholesterol, are ALSO linked to cataracts.1\n\nHigh blood sugar is also linked to cataracts.\n\nA cataract is a clouding of the eye\u2019s lens. Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness among people older than 55. Most older people have some degree of lens clouding, which is a normal part of aging.\n\nBoth my mom and two of my uncles have it. It\u2019s painless, but it can certainly lead to poor vision and blindness.\n\nSo, make sure your cholesterol levels are in a healthy range, NOT \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d.\n\n5 \u2013 Exercise & Rest Your Eyes\n\nSo, a few things here.\n\nRemember that you have muscles that control your eyes and they need to be exercised and rested \u2013 just like any muscle.\n\nYour eyes work hard during the day and need a break now and then. The strain can be especially intense if you work at a computer for long stretches at a time, which many of us do \u2013 especially me. To ease the strain, follow the 20-20-20 rule.2\n\nThat means every 20 minutes, you should stop staring at your computer or phone and look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n\nDo this for 3-5 \u201csets\u201d or times. This exercises and relaxes your eyes at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, make sure you wear sunglasses, which is one of the most important steps you can take when it comes to improving your eyesight. You want sunglasses that block out 100 percent of UVA and UVB radiation from sunlight.3\n\nMake sure your glasses say this and thus, don\u2019t buy cheap junk.\n\nSunglasses help protect your eyes from conditions that stem from eye damage. These include cataracts, macular degeneration, and pterygium \u2014 a growth of tissue over the white part of the eye.\n\nAdditionally, sunglasses with proper UV blockage reduce strain and stress on your eye muscles.\n\nSpeaking of which, I also suggest you install blue-blocking software on your computer screens and phones. I\u2019ve spoken about this in a previous article.\n\nThis is important again due to the extra stress your eye deals with with modern technology.\n\nIn the old days, the main source of blue light was the sun. Now it\u2019s everywhere, all day and night. That\u2019s too much stress for both your eyes and your brain.\n\nYou want to make sure you take extra amounts of vitamins and minerals that have been shown to improve eyesight.\n\nIt\u2019s very important to control your blood sugar and blood pressure levels.\n\nYou should have healthy cholesterol levels \u2013 not low or high. And definitely stay AWAY from statin cholesterol-lowering drugs.\n\nMake sure you also exercise and rest your eyes. Use the 20-20-20 rule. Wear sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB lights. And use blue-blockers as well.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to start implementing the 20-20-20 rule and using blue blockers \u2013 both are FREE and can be utilized in minutes.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8658343\n\nhttps://nei.nih.gov/kids/healthy_vision_tips\n\nhttps://nei.nih.gov/hvm/healthy_eyes_glasses",

    "title": "What Causes Weight Gain? | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss/what-causes-weight-gain/",
    "content": "Despite some common beliefs, weight gain isn\u2019t just caused by eating too much food or consuming too many calories every day. It can be a major contributor to gaining weight for many people, of course, but some people gain weight for a number of different reasons. Sometimes people gain weight because they eat at a time when their metabolism is slowing down instead of picking up. Even medication can cause weight gain with minimal calorie consumption involved.\n\nHow to Correct Weight Gain\n\nCan weight gain be fixed naturally? It can and the best news of all is that it can fixed while eating some superfoods with a combination of metabolism increasing herbs and vitamins so that metabolism levels can stay consistently high. Even when medication is the cause of weight gain, these agents can help to counteract the process of the side effect so that wardrobe purchases don\u2019t become necessary.\n\nIs exercise an important part of this equation? It is and if people aren\u2019t getting at least 30 minutes of exercise 3 or 4 times per week, then adding exercise to a daily routine can help counteract weight gain as well. Switching to high impact exercises can help to add an additional boost, but sometimes exercise is already part of the equation and not working. That\u2019s why these natural fixes can be an important part of a daily routine.\n\nFoods That Help with Weight Loss\n\nAlmonds Believe it or not, one of the most common reasons why people gain weight is because they aren\u2019t eating enough fats. When the body doesn\u2019t get enough of what it needs, it begins storing what it is provided so that it can be used for later. That\u2019s why eating healthy fats is such a critical component to almost every diet plan. Almonds are one of the best examples of this. Research into obesity shows that people who eat almonds every day can lose almost 20% of their total body fat even while consuming the same amount of calories.\n\nBeans All beans have a lot of starch in them, which is a very powerful fat attacker. Beans are also loaded with protein, which means you\u2019ll feel fuller longer when you\u2019re eating them regularly. One of the best beans to include in your diet are navy beans because they have the highest levels of starch in them. Just one serving of navy beans during one meal will help people burn up to 25% more fat each day than they would without the beans.\n\nBok Choy One of the issues that people face today is a lack of calcium. A lot of calcium is found in dairy products, which are often avoided because they are perceived to have a high fat content. You can still get nearly 20% of your daily levels of calcium from bok choy, however, and that\u2019s a good thing because it only has 20 total calories per serving. Why focus on calcium? High levels of calcium help to contribute to lower levels of fat. Eliminate the dairy, add some of this superfood, and weight gain can be naturally fought off.\n\nChocolate What about chocolate makes it help people lose weight? Processed chocolates aren\u2019t part of this. You\u2019ll want to have unrefined chocolate as much as possible to take advantage of the power of the cocoa. It helps because it is high in antioxidants, which can help to prevent body cells from accumulating new fats. It also helps that chocolate has a natural level of caffeine to it that helps to rev up a metabolism quickly too. Despite popular belief, unrefined chocolate is rather low in calorie content: half an ounce has less than 100 calories.\n\nGrapefruit What if the only change that was necessary was to add food to your diet? Grapefruits have a powerful effect on the metabolism, so much so that they can interact with the way medications are absorbed. If you take certain meds, then you can\u2019t add this superfood to help you naturally lose weight. Check with your doctor about all your medications before beginning. If you aren\u2019t taking medication, however, just add \u00bd a grapefruit to your diet that you eat before each meal. Research out of California shows that this one act can help people lose 1 pound per week.\n\nGreen Tea Three daily servings of green tea can help burn off 100 calories naturally. It also helps to reduce insulin levels and that helps to further combat weight gain. It works naturally without anything besides the water it is steeped in to detoxify your system and will even keep the kidneys working effectively. The more tea you drink throughout the day, the more calories you\u2019ll end up burning.\n\nKale According to a lot of research, kale is one of the most powerful foods to eat that is available today to combat fat. It provides many of the nutrients the human body needs every day and does so with low calorie counts and high calcium levels. It\u2019s an effective detoxing agent as well and is often part of juice fasts.\n\nPears Did you know that people who eat pears actually eat fewer calories throughout the day? In the journal Nutrition, researchers followed women who would eat a minimum of three pears each day. The study tracked how many calories they consumed every day and what their weights would be compared to women who didn\u2019t eat pears. The results showed that the women eating at least 3 pears lost more weight and ate less food each day than those who didn\u2019t eat them. Part of the reason is the amount of fiber a pear has \u2013 just 1 pear provides nearly 20% of the daily recommended intake of fiber.\n\nWeight gain can happen for a number of reasons, but there are an equal amount of ways to naturally combat it too. Utilize these ingredients to naturally fight gaining too much weight and you\u2019ll feel more energetic throughout the day! What foods could you add to your diet today?",

    "title": "8 Natural Herbs and Vitamins for Anxious Feelings",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness/natural-herbs-and-vitamins-for-anxiety/",
    "content": "Anxious feelings and stress can form for a number of reasons. It could be your basic bad day after a long afternoon at work. It could be from receiving financial news about investments that have unexpectedly fallen through. A little stress is easy for the human body to handle and it can readily adapt to a routine of light stress without really causing anyone any problems. When levels of stress or anxious feelings begin to rise, trouble can begin.\n\nThere are many long-term health problems that can develop because of stress. It can drive your nervous system out of balance. Too much stress leads to burnout. Add in some anxious feelings with the stress and it is very easy for people to develop panic attacks, even when they\u2019ve never add issues with them in the past.\n\nMany sufferers of stress search for adequate coping skills to manage the stress and anxieties of life. What if there was a way that you could naturally manage your stress and anxious feelings using all-natural ingredients to help keep your body healthy and balanced? It might not be possible to change the environment that surrounds you, but it is possible to change how your body works through these vitamins and herbs so that you can better adapt to changing situations that can cause lots of stress.\n\n1. Chamomile. The most common way you\u2019ll find this flower is in tea. It is known to support the health of a person\u2019s nerves and it helps to soothe the body and provide better overall blood circulation. Although it can also help to increase mental awareness, in many people it helps them relax to the point that they end up falling asleep. When taken regularly, this natural herb to reduce stress will also help with the digestive process.\n\n2. Choline. If you eat a lot of eggs, shrimp, or scallops, then you\u2019re likely consuming the levels of choline that you need. It\u2019s one of the newest items on the must have nutrient list, having been tracked for less than 20 years. Many experts believe it works with the B vitamins and it helps the body by improving the communication from the brain throughout the nervous system. It also helps with the memory processors within the brain, and when consumed in proper amounts, it will effectively help you reduce stress and anxious feelings naturally.\n\n3. Fennel. The smell of licorice is what many people associate with fennel and it has been proven to help create a stronger digestive system. The seeds of this herb can also help people deal with emotional stresses that have happened because it helps to relax the body and stimulate the pleasure centers of the nervous system, creating feelings of joy to replace the negative feelings of stress.\n\n4. Feverfew. This plant is native to Eastern Europe and has long been used to help reduce fevers in people, hence its name. It grows throughout much of the world today and helps to provide muscle relaxation. With reduced muscle tension, it is a lot easier for people to relax from a stressful day. Generally taken proactively rather than after a stressful event, it is even used as a way to treat asthma and migraines today as well. The leaves of this plant can be eaten, while tablets, capsules, and liquid extracts are commonly found.\n\n5. Inositol. Found in many foods and plants, inositol isn\u2019t really an herb or a vitamin, but it does mimic these qualities and can be taken as a supplement. It can even be made in a lab. It\u2019s often used as a relaxant because it acts as a depressant on the nervous system. It is extremely effective in controlling diabetic nerve pain, but it also effectively treats people who suffer from generalized anxious feelings. It works because it helps to balance the chemicals in the body that can become out of sync with high levels of anxious feelings and stress. Just be careful about how you get this substance because if you take it with an energy drink, you\u2019ll likely create more problems instead of solving some.\n\n6. Passionflower. This herb provides support to the nervous system by focusing on how the body reacts to relaxing stimuli. It has been known to be effective in calming restlessness for generations, but it doesn\u2019t change a person\u2019s mood in order to generate results. It assists with sleep and is so powerful that it is often used to help people who are trying to get off of a narcotics addiction.\n\n7. Schizandra. If you need immediate help with a very tense situation, then having some of this fruit on hand could be highly beneficial. It helps the body respond to stress immediately, which means it can also help people stay more productive throughout the day. It\u2019s very bitter, but in return, people receive better circulation. In ancient homeopathic medicine, this fruit was called the herb that could do everything. Some believe it has anti-aging properties and that it can promote having beautiful skin and even increase sexual energies, but the effects on stress in the human body are well documented.\n\n8. Vitamin C. You might also know this vitamin as L-ascorbic acid. It helps the human body produce anti-stress hormones and is one of the essential vitamins for survival. Many take this vitamin to prevent illness or boost the immune system and it has helped to treat scurvy throughout time. It is thought to help with mental processes, assist in the digestive process, and even help with skin infections that might produce a boil. Just be careful about taking this vitamin in high doses, as it can also help to create kidney stones. It also raises blood sugar levels in diabetics, so any high amounts should be closely monitored.\n\nThese natural remedies can help bring about fast and proactive relief from stress and anxious feelings. Consider adding them to your daily routine today so that the stresses and fears of tomorrow can be effectively ignored. What better way is there to cope with stress than create conditions within the body to resist it naturally?",

    "content": "Magnesium Glycinate is a combination of magnesium and glycine which is often used as a health supplement. Magnesium is an essential mineral while glycine is an amino acid that helps the body absorb the magnesium even better. The combination is often used to fight fatigue, fibromyalgia and other symptoms found in the body.\n\nHowever, magnesium glycinate is now being used to help suppress the conditions of anxiety in the body as well. The use of this supplement in treating what is considered a mental imbalance is a relatively new one, but arguably not all that surprising given just how potent magnesium is for our needs.\n\nHow Magnesium Glycinate Treats Anxiety\n\nThis substance is not directed to treat anxiety so much as it helps balance out mood swings. Magnesium Glycinate is used by the neurotransmitter receptor sites in the mind to help regulate their function. When not enough magnesium is present, it becomes more difficult for the mind to react to swings of mood such as an anxiety attack.\n\nIt is known that people who suffer from depression, especially long-lasting depression have low levels of magnesium in their bodies. The following are signs that a person may lack having enough magnesium in their body;\n\nThese are the mental symptoms of not having enough magnesium in the body. These particular symptoms are noticeably present where there is no particular reason, such as extended periods of grieving or insomnia.\n\nThere are also physical symptoms as well which include the following:\n\nIrregular or Rapid Heartbeat\n\nSustained Muscle Contractions\n\nSuch symptoms that appear over a period of time should be addressed by your doctor as they are quite often caused by a lack of magnesium in the body. However, there may be other reasons as well which might need to be addressed. Therefore, a trip to see your doctor should be the first step before taking additional magnesium.\n\nWhy Magnesium Glycinate Works\n\nThe essential reasons why this product works is that it helps to stabilize your nervous system by opening up the lines of communication within your mind and body so that they can react more readily. Although your conscious mind become aware of the anxiety, the body lacks the communication necessary to restore the proper balance because it lacks magnesium and the right amino acid in the transmission system.\n\nIn addition, the amino acid glycine also helps produce a calming effect on the body by assisting in the removal of mercury. The presence of mercury in the body in higher amounts can lead to instability of the emotions. By adding glycine, it helps to remove this substance and create a more calming effect overall.\n\nBy adding this product, your body gets the message much more quickly and balance is restored more readily. Magnesium Glycinate is certainly a potent substance that your body needs so that it can fight off the effects of anxiety more readily.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Seredyn is a medication that helps people suffering from anxiety attacks to feel calmer, more relaxed and in control. Plus, the overall confidence level is boosted as well, making seredyn a very popular treatment for many people who suffer from bouts of anxiety.\n\nBut does seredyn really work or is it just another series of promises that do not live up to the hype? In truth, the history of seredyn as an effective treatment for anxiety attacks is one that offers up interesting information as to its effectiveness.\n\nSeredyn is a supplement that consists of several vitamins and minerals that are mixed with L-Theanine which is an amino acid, Valerian and Passion flower. The combination of these ingredients is supposedly what gives seredyn its ability to calm the anxiety attack without creating unwanted side effects. At the very least, these are all natural ingredients that have been used in other products without creating harmful side effects on the body.\n\nThe overall approach of seredyn is that of supplementing the needs of the brain in order to counteract the effects of the anxiety and help achieve a proper balance so that the feelings and elevated state of the body is effectively addressed.\n\nWhat Seredyn Does for Anxiety Attacks\n\nIt must be noted that seredyn does not pretend to be a cure, but rather an all natural supplement that addresses an anxiety attack. In many ways, seredyn can be viewed as a natural substance in the same manner that aspirin addresses headaches. Seredyn is not a cure, but instead a treatment that helps people get over a current anxiety attack.\n\nCalmness: By adding these natural ingredients, seredyn supplements the needs of the body and the brain that an anxiety attack drains away. By restoring the natural balance, people who take seredyn have a feeling of calmness and serenity that replaces their anxieties.\n\nNo Side Effects: Currently, all the research and anecdotal statements from customers of this product indicates that seredyn produces no unwanted side effects when taken in proper doses and when needed. However, this does not mean it is safe to use with other medications whether they are prescription or all natural.\n\nEffective: For many people who suffer from mild anxiety attacks, seredyn has proven to be an effective means of controlling the symptoms and bringing about a peaceful, even confident feeling. However, seredyn may not work for everyone.\n\nIs Seredyn Right for You\n\nAs with any medication or treatment whether natural or not, it is highly recommended that you consult with your doctor first. This is because your anxiety attacks may be caused by something that seredyn cannot treat. So, once the proper diagnosis is made and the ingredients in seredyn can address the situation, it can be used by your doctor\u2019s advice.\n\nSeredyn has proven to be very effective for a large group of anxiety sufferers over the years and it may well work for you.

    "content": "Today, let\u2019s discuss a natural supplement that\u2019s been getting a lot of attention: pine pollen.\n\nYou might have heard it\u2019s great for boosting testosterone. But is it true? Let\u2019s dive into the details.\n\nPine pollen is exactly what it sounds like \u2013 the pollen from pine trees.\n\nIt\u2019s been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Packed with vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other nutrients, pine pollen is considered a superfood.\n\nBut what makes it interesting is its potential to boost testosterone levels.\n\nHow Does Pine Pollen Boost Testosterone?\n\nPine pollen contains phytoandrogens \u2013 plant-based compounds that mimic testosterone. These phytoestrogens can help balance your hormones naturally.\n\nHere\u2019s how pine pollen can help boost testosterone:\n\nPhytoandrogens: These compounds can bind to androgen receptors in the body, promoting anabolic (muscle-building) activity similar to testosterone.\n\nDHEA Content: Pine pollen contains DHEA, a precursor hormone that the body can convert into testosterone.\n\nNutrient Support: Pine pollen is rich in vitamins and minerals like vitamin D, magnesium, and zinc, which are crucial for testosterone production.\n\nBenefits of Pine Pollen for Testosterone\n\nHere are the main benefits of using pine pollen for testosterone:\n\nIncreased Muscle Mass: Testosterone is key for muscle growth and maintenance. By boosting testosterone levels, pine pollen can help you build and maintain muscle mass.\n\nEnhanced Libido: Higher testosterone levels often lead to a better libido. If you\u2019ve noticed a dip in your sex drive, pine pollen might help reignite that spark.\n\nImproved Energy and Stamina: Low testosterone can cause fatigue and low energy. Pine pollen may help increase your energy levels and improve your stamina.\n\nBetter Mood: Testosterone also plays a role in mood regulation. Increasing your testosterone levels with pine pollen can help improve your mood and reduce feelings of depression.\n\nHow to Take Pine Pollen\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in trying pine pollen, here are a few tips:\n\nPowder Form: You can mix it into smoothies, juices, or water. Start with a small dose and gradually increase as needed.\n\nTincture Form: Pine pollen tinctures are concentrated extracts. They\u2019re typically more potent and can be taken directly under the tongue for better absorption.\n\nCapsules: If you prefer a no-fuss option, pine pollen capsules are available. Just follow the dosage instructions on the label.\n\nAre There Any Side Effects?\n\nPine pollen is generally safe for most people.\n\nHowever, if you have a pollen allergy, it\u2019s best to avoid it.\n\nSome people might experience mild side effects like digestive discomfort or allergic reactions. As always, it\u2019s a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement.\n\nPine pollen is a natural, nutrient-rich supplement that can help boost testosterone levels slightly.\n\nWith benefits like increased muscle mass, enhanced libido, improved energy, and better mood, it\u2019s no wonder pine pollen is gaining popularity. If you\u2019re looking for a natural way to support your testosterone levels, pine pollen might be worth a try.\n\nBut if you want a powerful, all-in-one natural solution for boosting testosterone levels \u2013 you should try AlphaViril. It contains all-natural, tested, and proven ingredients \u2013 in optimal forms and dosages to boost your testosterone.",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and we live in a world of prescription drugs\u2026 especially in the US.\n\nDuring daytime TV, there are drug commercials all day long, almost every few minutes it seems.\n\nAnd they\u2019re aimed at older people.\n\nIf you have a problem, we\u2019ve got a drug.\n\nYour doctor doesn\u2019t ask about your health, lifestyle, diet, exercise, or supplements. I don\u2019t blame them\u2026\n\nThey learned about none of that in medical school.\n\nIt was all about drugs. How to deal with the symptoms, not the cause.\n\nThere is no such thing as \u201cpreventative\u201d, it\u2019s all about putting a big bandaid on a problem and over time, add more and more bandaids in the form of more and more drugs.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 my background is in pharmacology, which is the study of drugs. They are super powerful and amazing.\n\nBut NOT to be used long-term.\n\nThey are originally designed for extreme cases and short-term use.\n\nBut hey, where\u2019s the money on that?\n\nSo, let\u2019s make drugs easily prescribable and addictive \u2013 this is the way to make billions of dollars, year after year, decade after decade.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not my philosophy.\n\nYou can fix 95% of health problems naturally \u2014 diet, exercise, stress management, and natural herbal & vitamin supplements.\n\nWith that said, today I\u2019m going to list 5 very popular prescription drugs that cause lots of damage to your health \u2014 body and mind.\n\nAnd in each category, I\u2019ll also give natural options and alternatives.\n\nPrednisone \u2013 For Inflammation\n\nPrednisone is a \u201ccorticosteroid\u201d, a catabolic steroid related to cortisol \u2013 the STRESS hormone.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of an anabolic steroid athletes take to gain muscle, strength, and lose fat.\n\nSo, logically speaking, you can deduce that prednisone, therefore, causes the opposite effects:\n\nAnd massive FAT gain, especially belly fat\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. It also causes:\n\nIncreased blood sugar and diabetes\n\nOsteoporosis and weaker bones\n\nLiver and kidney problems\n\nDepression and mental illness\n\nDecreases the immune system\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nSimply stated, prednisone is STRESS in a bottle.\n\nSo, why is such a toxic drug used so often?\n\nWell, short term, it\u2019s a powerful anti-inflammatory.\n\nThis is very important if you have some horrible allergic reaction or have breathing problems.\n\nIt can save your life.\n\nAs horrible as cortisol is, without it you\u2019d die. So, it\u2019s that powerful and important.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Prednisone helps with pain that\u2019s linked to inflammation.\n\nBut these days, they prescribe it for lots of things and it\u2019s ongoing, long-term.\n\nWhich is NOT what you want.\n\nYou obviously don\u2019t want to be swallowing STRESS all day long, week after week, month after month.\n\nIt\u2019ll destroy your health.\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cstress kills\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to occasionally use SHORT TERM.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s much better to deal with the main problem \u2013 which is inflammation.\n\nI\u2019ve got links for natural ways of dealing with inflammation \u2014 which as you know if you\u2019ve been following me for some time \u2013 I think inflammation is linked to many health problems, and the older we get, the worse the inflammation and pain.\n\nHealthy Inflammation & Pain Relief\n\nProton Pump Inhibitors \u2013 For Stomach Acid\n\nProton Pump Inhibitors (PPI\u2019s) work by reducing the amount of stomach acid the lining of your stomach produces.\n\nSimply stated, they are prescribed for symptoms of acid reflux or GERD. Or in layman\u2019s terms, \u201cheartburn\u201d\n\nAnd this is when the foods or liquids you eat, move up from the stomach, back up to the esophagus or throat, and cause that burning sensation.\n\nThe most popular and common drugs are:\n\nOmeprazole (Prilosec), also available over-the-counter (without a prescription)\n\nEsomeprazole (Nexium), also available over-the-counter (without a prescription)\n\nLansoprazole (Prevacid), also available over-the-counter (without a prescription)\n\nRabeprazole (AcipHex)\n\nPantoprazole (Protonix)\n\nDexlansoprazole (Dexilant)\n\nZegerid (omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate), also available over-the-counter (without a prescription)\n\nSome of the major side effects are:\n\nIncreased bone fractures\n\nPneumonia, infections, and lowered immune system\n\nIron & B12 deficiency\n\n25-50% higher risk of KIDNEY DISEASE\n\nBacterial overgrowth in the gut, which can lead to tons of other health problems.\n\nPoor absorption of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals\n\nNumerous negative interactions with other drugs.\n\nIncreased cortisol levels and stress hormones, which will cause lots of other problems.\n\nAnd yet, people are popping these drugs all the time like candy. No big deal.\n\nForget about improving your diet and stress levels \u2013 just pop a pill and go eat pizza.\n\nIn the old days, we used to take TUMS to help reduce stomach acid after a big meal.\n\nTUMS is basically calcium and thus, it\u2019s alkaline \u2013 the opposite of acid.\n\nI\u2019ll do another video specifically about natural ways to reduce acid reflux because there are a lot of dos and don\u2019ts with your lifestyle.\n\nHowever, most importantly, you need to reduce your stress and cortisol levels. This is a big trigger for most people.\n\nOf course, reducing stress in our lives can be difficult. However, there are specific vitamins & herbs that help reduce stress & cortisol.\n\nBest Vitamins To Reduce Stress Hormones\n\nStatin Drugs \u2013 For Cholesterol\n\nStatin drugs are used to help lower cholesterol levels. They are one of the most prescribed drugs in the world and have been for almost 20 years.\n\nMore popular drugs are:\n\natorvastatin (Lipitor),\n\nfluvastatin (Lescol, Lescol XL),\n\nlovastatin (Mevacor, Altoprev),\n\npravastatin (Pravachol),\n\nrosuvastatin (Crestor),\n\nsimvastatin (Zocor), and.\n\npitavastatin (Livalo).\n\nThese drugs were originally prescribed to both my parents a long time ago. So, I\u2019m very familiar with their side effects, which are typically:\n\nMuscle pain, loss, and damage \u2013 this includes ALL muscles in the body\n\nIncreased blood sugar or type 2 diabetes\n\nNeurological problems with the brain \u2013 such as memory loss, confusion, etc.\n\nAccelerated aging and depletion of mitochondria\n\nLowered hormone levels, testosterone, erectile problems, etc.\n\nMore and more issues.\n\nAgain, as with all drugs \u2013 Statins are very powerful and good to use if you have a genetic problem with having very high cholesterol.\n\nOr if diet, exercise, and supplements do nothing for you \u2013 again, because of genetics and negative hormonal changes due to aging.\n\nNeedless to say, they are overprescribed and at much higher doses than what\u2019s needed to accomplish better cholesterol levels.\n\nI\u2019ve also included links to natural ways to have healthy cholesterol levels. This is the exact formula that my parents have used for the past 25+ years.\n\nBest Vitamins For Healthy Cholesterol Levels\n\nAntidepressants & Anti-Anxiety\n\nI was really surprised to find out that up to 25% of the population take antidepressants and/or anti-anxiety medications.\n\nAnd many times, a combination of both at the same time!!!\n\nIt\u2019s sad that it\u2019s starting at a much younger age, in the teenage years.\n\nThey\u2019re used more in women than men.\n\nAnd they are used even more by older people, over the age of 55.\n\nSadly, the statistics show that the use is increasing every decade.\n\nSome people for sure need such drugs, but the majority don\u2019t. Certainly not long-term use, year after year.\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy is that many clinical studies show these drugs do NOT work any better than placebo, fake sugar pills.\n\nAnd other clinical studies show how they are extremely addictive, especially anti-anxiety drugs.\n\nUnfortunately, there are so many reasons or causes for having anxiety or feeling down or sad:\n\nSo, it\u2019s very hard to really get to the root cause.\n\nSo, doctors just treat the symptoms and try to numb us all by prescribing drugs.\n\nFor example, taking 3-5 grams of fish oil daily has been clinically shown to reduce both depression and anxiety. Not to mention lots of other health benefits.\n\nThere are lots of herbs and amino acids that are super powerful and clinically validated and work for improving mindset and feelings.\n\nBest of all, these herbs work quickly and have NONE of the drug side effects.\n\nBest Herbs For Improving Mood & Happiness\n\nOne of the biggest used and abused drugs are sleep medications \u2014 prescription, as well as over-the-counter (OTC).\n\nAnd in all honesty, this is one set of drugs that I had personally used in the past because I\u2019ve never been a good sleeper.\n\nGranted, part of it is genetics and a bigger part of it is my own lifestyle and poor \u201csleep hygiene\u201d because of school and work.\n\nI\u2019ve made tremendous progress and improvements here in the past decade and I\u2019ve created specific videos just about this topic, for free.\n\nHowever, the problem with sleeping medications is that they are super addictive.\n\nSadly, they do NOT improve the debt or the quality of your sleep. They actually make things worse and reduce REM sleep.\n\nThe end result is that your body AND brain don\u2019t heal, repair and grow properly during this \u201cdrug-induced\u201d sleep.\n\nAnd your hormones get much worse because of it.\n\nStress hormones, testosterone, melatonin, insulin, growth hormone, etc., etc.\n\nSleep is easily the most powerful \u201cfix\u201d for a healthy future, body, and mind.\n\nPoor sleep causes muscle loss, fat gain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and worse of all \u2013 brain problems leading to memory issues.\n\nSo, I can understand why people take sleep medications \u2013 I really do\u2026\n\nHowever, the long-term side effects aren\u2019t worth it \u2014 one of the big ones being short AND long-term memory problems\u2026 especially later in life.\n\nAnother problem is that there are all sorts of sleeping medications, such as\n\nAmbien, Sonata, Lunesta, etc.\n\nAntidepressants, such as Trazodone\n\nAntianxiety Benzo drugs, such as Restoril, Halcion, Xanax, etc.\n\nAnd over-the-counter ones such as Unisom, Benadryl, Tylenol PM\n\nAs I said, I\u2019ve tried a few of these, and every time there was a massive problem.\n\nI either didn\u2019t feel refreshed the next day, even though I slept the entire night.\n\nOr I felt super groggy the next day \u2013 which negatively affected work, exercise, etc.\n\nOr I emotionally felt like crap \u2014 depressed, unmotivated, no drive, low libido, etc., etc.\n\nHowever, I know how important sleep is and thus, I\u2019ve created a bunch of free videos and articles about this topic at this site.\n\nAdditionally, there are powerful herbs that I take, that naturally help your fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.\n\nBest Herbs For Youthful Deep Sleep\n\nStimulants \u2013 For ADHD & Energy\n\nFinally, the last class of drugs that have very negative effects on your health and are heavily prescribed are stimulants or ADHD drugs or \u201cuppers\u201d or some kind of \u201camphetamine\u201d.\n\nThese are supposed to be used by people who have Attention Deficit Disorder.\n\nHowever, more than half of the prescriptions are for \u201coff label\u201d use, and thus, people just wanting more energy and focus.\n\nAthletes, parents, business people, students, dieters, etc., etc., etc.\n\nThe prescription for these drugs has more than DOUBLED in the past decade.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that I have a few friends who are pharmacists and whenever I ask them what their top-selling drugs are, over and over again this class of drugs is in the top 5.\n\nAnd not only that, it\u2019s heavily used by young people\u2026 as early as prepubescent and up to the age 25 is the biggest use.\n\nNow, the more popular ones that you may have heard of are:\n\nThe problem with these drugs is that they just burn out your adrenals or nervous system. They stress the body. They cause massive hormonal imbalances.\n\nThey obviously cause heart problems, elevated blood pressure, and so forth.\n\nThe real problem is that they accelerate aging.\n\nBut the biggest issue is they cause massive sleep problems, which then cause a cascade of negative health problems, hormonal imbalances, and so on and so forth.\n\nNot to mention, they are super addictive and very hard to come off of.\n\nThe sad irony is that these drugs cause anxiety and sleep problems as mentioned earlier and thus, more drugs are prescribed to deal with the negative side effects.\n\nHowever, there is no arguing that we all want more physical energy and better mental focus. The more energy you have, the more you get done in the day and the better you feel.\n\nAgain, this is a very important topic and I\u2019ve created free videos & articles about increasing your energy levels.\n\nPlus, if you want fast results, take a look at the best herbs & vitamins for an immediate boost in energy & focus.\n\nInstantly Increase Energy & Focus\n\nSo out of the 5 classes of drugs \u2013 how many are you on? Or have taken in the past?\n\nEither way, there are always natural solutions, which I think are much safer.",

To make a long story short, we tried everything\u2026\n\nCholesterol-lowering drugs \u2014 these worked, but these just had LOTS of negative side effects, as I\u2019m sure you know.\n\nChange in lifestyle \u2014 better diet, exercise, rest, etc\u2026 It also helped in the long run, but it required a lot more discipline and sacrifices\n\nSupplements, herbs, and vitamins \u2014 most were just a waste of time and money. Only about 6-7 key ingredients had a \u201cmagical effect\u201d. And I\u2019ll tell you which ones at the end of this short presentation\n\nWhat I discovered through all of these things we tested is that the real cause of unhealthy cholesterol is genetics and the negative changes in your HORMONES due to AGING!\n\nAnd this is why the older we get, the higher the cholesterol levels.\n\nAnd why do women who go through menopause, all of a sudden have an increase in cholesterol\u2026\n\nAgain, the change in hormones.\n\nAnd this is why teenagers and people in their 20s rarely have cholesterol problems and yet, they live a very unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nAnd this is where the correct type of exercise can make improvements in your \u201cyouth hormones\u201d, which will eventually cause an improvement in your cholesterol levels and lipid levels.\n\nOne of the best ways to improve your \u201cyouth\u201d hormones and help slow down aging, is by utilizing \u201cresistant exercise\u201d.\n\nBasically, lifting weights!\n\nThis can be done with free weights, cables, machines, or even your own body weight.\n\nThus, this can be done almost anywhere, anytime \u2014 no machines or gyms.\n\nWhen you lift weights, you increase testosterone, growth hormones, thyroid hormones, and other \u201cyouth\u201d hormones, which naturally help \u201cfix/improve\u201d many health problems over time \u2014 one of them being an unhealthy cholesterol profile.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not going to get \u201cbuffed\u201d out \u2013 especially women. That\u2019s just genetics and lots of steroids.\n\nAnyway, all you need is about 3x a week, no more than an hour. That\u2019s just 3 hours a week to look younger, have more energy, get stronger and stay healthier.\n\nThe next best exercise is walking. Again, you can do it anywhere, anytime.\n\nWalking is great because it is AEROBIC (with oxygen), while lifting weights is ANAEROBIC (without oxygen).\n\nThe REAL benefit of walking is that it helps lower your stress hormones, such as cortisol \u2014 which is an \u201caging\u201d hormone.\n\nAs far as how much, how often, and how long?\u2026\n\nStart off lifting weights 3x a week, 30-60 min. That\u2019s all you need.\n\nAnd walk 3-4x weekly, 20-45 min. Start low and build up over time.\n\nYou can do your walking and lifting weights on the same day or on alternate days \u2026 or whenever.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is that you just do it!\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Are you thinking about detoxing your liver naturally? Milk thistle might just be the solution you\u2019ve been searching for.\n\nToday we\u2019ll tackle a common question: How long should you take milk thistle to detox your liver naturally?\n\nMilk thistle, also known as Silybum marianum, has a long history of use for its liver-protecting and detoxifying properties. Packed with antioxidants, this herb can help support your liver health and its natural detox process.\n\nWe\u2019ll cover the recommended dosage, potential side effects, and the best duration for milk thistle supplementation to make your liver detox a success.\n\nBenefits Of Milk Thistle For Your Liver\n\nMilk thistle is a flowering herb that\u2019s been used for centuries as a natural remedy for liver issues.\n\nIts active ingredient, silymarin, is a powerful antioxidant that helps shield the liver from damage caused by toxins and free radicals.\n\nYour liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying your body by filtering out harmful substances, processing drugs and alcohol, and producing bile to aid digestion.\n\nThings like a poor diet, alcohol, toxins in the environment, and certain medications can put a strain on your liver and slow down its detox process.\n\nMilk thistle steps in by encouraging the growth of new liver cells and stopping toxins from entering liver cells.\n\nIt also fights inflammation, which is common in liver damage. Plus, it boosts levels of glutathione, a potent antioxidant made by the liver, further enhancing its detox abilities.\n\nHow Your Liver Detoxifies?\n\nBefore we dive into how long to take milk thistle, let\u2019s quickly go over how your liver detoxifies. There are two main phases:\n\nPhase I: Enzymes in your liver convert toxins into intermediary compounds, which can generate harmful free radicals. Antioxidants like silymarin in milk thistle neutralize these free radicals, preventing further damage.\n\nPhase II: The intermediary compounds from Phase I are further processed and eliminated from your body. This phase involves conjugating these compounds with other molecules to make them easier to excrete. Milk thistle helps by boosting the production of enzymes needed for this process.\n\nThe Benefits of Milk Thistle for Liver Detox\n\nMilk thistle has become popular for its potential to support liver health and aid in detoxification. Here are some key benefits:\n\nProtects liver cells: Milk thistle\u2019s antioxidants shield liver cells from damage.\n\nPromotes liver regeneration: It helps grow new liver cells, aiding in repair.\n\nEnhances detoxification: By boosting detox enzymes, milk thistle helps your liver eliminate toxins more efficiently.\n\nReduces inflammation: It fights inflammation, a common feature of liver damage.\n\nWhile milk thistle shows promise, remember that individual results may vary. It\u2019s always best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement.\n\nRecommended Dosage and Duration for Milk Thistle\n\nFiguring out how much milk thistle to take and for how long can be tricky, as it depends on factors like your health and the severity of your liver issues. But here are some general guidelines:\n\nDosage: Most people take 200-400 milligrams per day, split into two or three doses. Look for a standardized supplement with 70-80% silymarin for best results.\n\nDuration: While there\u2019s no set timeframe, it\u2019s usually recommended to take milk thistle for 4-6 weeks to allow it to work. Some may need longer, especially for chronic liver problems or ongoing toxin exposure.\n\nRemember, these are just guidelines. Always talk to your doctor for personalized advice.\n\nFactors to Consider When Deciding How Long to Take Milk Thistle\n\nWhen deciding how long to take milk thistle, consider these factors:\n\nYour health: The severity of your liver issues can influence how long you need to take milk thistle.\n\nToxin exposure: If you\u2019re regularly exposed to toxins, you might need to take milk thistle for longer.\n\nYour lifestyle: Eating well and exercising can support liver health and complement milk thistle\u2019s effects.\n\nYour body\u2019s response: Everyone\u2019s different, so pay attention to how your body reacts.\n\nAlways start slowly and see how you feel.\n\nPotential Side Effects and Precautions\n\nMilk thistle is generally safe, but it can cause some side effects like digestive upset or allergic reactions in some people. It can also interact with certain medications, so talk to your doctor before starting.\n\nIncorporating Other Liver-Boosting Remedies\n\nAlongside milk thistle, consider other natural remedies like dandelion root, turmeric, and artichoke to support liver health.",

    "content": "I get a lot of masturbation questions and I\u2019ve done lots of videos about this topic. However, I\u2019ve never done one about masturbation and if it can cause any deficiencies in vitamins and/or minerals.\n\nThis is a good question and it can be expanded to having sex and basically, having orgasms or more so in a man\u2019s case, ejaculating causing specific vitamins or minerals to leave your body\u2026\n\nDoes Masturbation Cause Deficiencies?\n\nSo the answer is NO \u2013 masturbating, having orgasms, or specifically \u2013 ejaculating, does NOT directly deplete the body of essential nutrients.\n\nVitamin and mineral deficiencies typically occur due to inadequate dietary intake, poor absorption, certain medical conditions, or other factors that affect nutrient absorption, utilization, or storage within your body.\n\nHowever, excessive ejaculation, whether through masturbation or sexual intercourse, may theoretically cause a minor loss of certain nutrients, such as zinc, as these are components of semen.\n\nOf course, too much ejaculating in any form, can cause hormonal imbalances such as lowered testosterone, higher female hormones like prolactin, and so forth. But, that\u2019s another topic for another video.\n\nGetting Back to Zinc\u2026\n\nThis mineral is especially important for men.\n\nZinc is a mineral that\u2019s present in relatively high concentrations in semen, and frequent ejaculation could potentially lead to a slight decrease in zinc levels.\n\nI\u2019ve done lots of specific videos about zinc, its pros and cons, how to take it, what\u2019s the best form, dosage, and so forth \u2026\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Zinc is involved in various physiological processes and is essential for immune function, wound healing, testosterone production, libido, hair loss and many other bodily functions.\n\nSadly, many people, especially men are usually deficient or lacking in Zinc.\n\nAdditionally, zinc needs to be taken with copper to balance it out or else you\u2019ll get a copper deficiency, which can cause problems \u2013 one being accelerated grey hair.\n\nSadly, this is something I learned the hard way after taking high doses of zinc for many years, without any copper. I didn\u2019t know about the grey hair problem. So, I want you to learn from my mistakes.\n\nHowever, the reality is that the amount of zinc or other potential nutrients lost through ejaculation is generally considered negligible and doesn\u2019t typically lead to clinically significant deficiencies, especially with a balanced diet and supplementation program.\n\nSo in summary \u2013 no worries about vitamin and mineral deficiencies caused by masturbation or more specifically, ejaculation.\n\nHowever, I do urge you to go watch my other videos about Zinc.\n\nAs well as those about the pros and cons of masturbation.\n\nGet informed, take action, improve your health, and live a happier and healthier life!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "I was asked the other day, \u201cis broccoli good for you? I know it\u2019s a vegetable, but I\u2019ve heard not all vegetables are healthy for you \u2013 let me know doc?\u201d\n\nGood question and you\u2019re right \u2013 not all vegetables are good for you or good for SOME people. For example, nightshade vegetables \u2013 such as tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers \u2013 don\u2019t do well for some people. They contain an alkaloid known as solanine, which is also a mild toxin. They also contain lectins.\n\nGranted, some people are fine with them, no issues at all.\n\nAnd how you prepare and eat them also makes a difference. If you want me to do an article about this topic, what vegetables to avoid, and so forth, let me know.\n\nNow, getting back to broccoli\u2026 I\u2019ll discuss the pros, cons, how to cook them, and which type is best. There\u2019s one that contains 10x the benefits and you can eat much less of it as well.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick summary of some of the benefits:\n\nContains lots of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, especially when eaten raw or steamed\n\nhealthy inflammatory response1-3\n\nGood for your heart by supporting healthy lipid levels, cholesterol, and triglycerides9-11\n\nGood for your blood sugar levels12-13\n\nSlow cognitive and memory problems and it\u2019s good for your brain14-15\n\nGood for your colon, gut, digestion, and healthy source of fiber16-17\n\nHealthy for your joints and bones18-19\n\nBeneficial for your skin and UV damage20-21\n\nEven good for oral health\n\nSo as you can see, broccoli has lots of benefits. Of course, there are also some negatives as well.\n\nNegatives with Broccoli\n\nBroccoli is a cruciferous vegetable and, like most cruciferous veggies, can cause excess gas, bloating, flatulence, and possible digestive discomfort for some people.\n\nCan decrease thyroid production, especially with those who are hypothyroid or are on thyroid medication22\n\nNon-organic forms are loaded with pesticides, which are obviously not good for your health, especially your gut health and immune system. So, always buy organic if possible.\n\nRaw is always ideal, but for some, it does cause digestive issues. Steaming is the next best method and cooking is the least ideal method because it can kill a lot of the nutrients and benefits.\n\nMost people haven\u2019t heard of Broccoli Sprouts, however, this is probably one of the healthiest forms \u2026 and the healthiest foods you can eat.\n\nThis is because broccoli sprouts are high in sulforaphane, which has all the benefits I\u2019ve mentioned today, x10. It\u2019s like broccoli on steroids.\n\nThus, if you don\u2019t like to eat it, you can just eat a much smaller quantity of broccoli sprouts and get all the benefits and more.\n\nFinally, when eating your broccoli or any vegetable, please do NOT use salad dressings and so forth. Just use some salt, pepper, lemon juice, and balsamic vinegar. You can even put some extra virgin olive oil \u2013 just be mindful of the total calories of the oil.\n\nEat broccoli. Steam it or eat it raw. And broccoli sprouts are the best type.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19519500\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771951\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964540\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22877795\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22121852\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23679348\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23859034\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22391648\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22325157\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25617536\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355537\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22537070\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22537070\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263222\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23437066\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16633129\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22113065\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29749440\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21506109\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077285/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20354656\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740614/",

There are also a few, select specific herbs and minerals that also will make dramatic improvements to your erections, while more importantly, also optimizing your hormones and testosterone levels.\n\nI would say that one of the best vitamins for better erections is a specific B vitamin and that\u2019s B9.\n\nMore specifically, Folate.\n\nB9 is linked to nitric oxide production and thus, improved erections. It does this by improving blood flow, but NOT by improving hormones \u2013 which should be your primary goal.\n\nThere are clinical studies clearly showing that low levels of Folate, especially deficiency, are linked to erectile dysfunction.\n\nYou want to take the natural form of FOLATE supplement, not Folic Acid which is the synthetic form.\n\nThe most absorbable form is a patented and clinically validated form called BioFolate\u00ae (as L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium salt).\n\nThe ideal dose is between 400-600 mcgs daily. The supplement I take for testosterone boosting and better erections contains 500 mcgs, so it\u2019s right in the middle.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter when you take it, with or without food. I take my testosterone-boosting supplement about 15-20 mins before a meal.\n\nRemember, folate works by improving your blood flow by increasing Nitric Oxide levels.\n\nHowever, your main goal is to optimize and maximize your hormones in addition to improved blood flow and nitric oxide levels.\n\nMy favorite supplement contains the correct dose of Folate, in addition to other vitamins, minerals, and herbs. I\u2019ve been using it for over 20 years.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how it works for you!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://ejhm.journals.ekb.eg/article_19552_a118503d4208a33c8a01f565393e993b.pdf\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236337/",

    "content": "Recently, I did an article about \u201cThe 4 Primary Ways To Build Muscle\u201d \u2026 which was about building muscle, getting stronger, and also losing fat.\n\nIn that article, I explained what to eat and I quickly mentioned how you should NOT eat peanuts.\n\nWell, I got lots of questions in 2025 as to why this is and how can peanuts be bad for you, since they have good fat, lots of protein, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nAnd this is a fair question and let me answer it quickly.\n\nTo begin with, peanuts are not \u201cnuts\u201d, they are legumes and thus, part of the \u201cbean\u201d family. Most people don\u2019t know this.\n\nAs to why you should avoid peanuts, there are a few important reasons.\n\nTo begin with, some people are deathly allergic to peanuts. For a small percentage of the population, peanuts can literally kill them.\n\nOf course, the majority of people aren\u2019t AS allergic to peanuts, but if you ate enough of them, long enough, the allergens start to build up, and you WILL have allergic reactions, even if they are mild and subtle.\n\nIt won\u2019t kill you, but it won\u2019t improve your health either.\n\nThe next thing is that people will say that peanuts are a healthy food because it has carbs, proteins, and fats. But the protein doesn\u2019t contain all the essential amino acids.\n\nThe next problem is the fat content \u2013 it\u2019s fairly high in Omega 6 fats and linoleic acid. Omega 6 fats cause inflammation and health problems\n\nThey also compete with the healthy, omega-3 fats \u2013 which is NOT what you want.\n\nMost people don\u2019t know, but peanuts actually grow underground, where they tend to be colonized by a fungus called Aspergillus, a source of aflatoxins... which are toxic and highly carcinogenic.\n\nHumans are actually fairly resistant to the acute (short-term) effects of aflatoxins but unfortunately continued exposure does cause a buildup. Additionally, the fungus grows on its own and thus, even if you stop eating peanuts the fungus continues to grow inside of you and over time becomes toxic.\n\nStudies in humans link aflatoxin exposure to liver cancer, stunted growth in children, and mental retardation.\n\nThis is very important for all your parents giving your kids peanut butter daily. I suggest you STOP!\n\nPeanuts are also high in Lectins, which is bad for your health \u2014 again, causing all the typical health problems, inflammation, weight gain, memory problems, joint pain, etc., etc.\n\nPeanuts and nuts taste yummy, there\u2019s no denying that. Especially when roasted and lightly salted.\n\nAnd in small amounts, eaten occasionally \u2013 they should be fine for most people.\n\nHowever, I suggest you switch to other nuts, especially if you are giving your kids peanut butter. Instead, eat:\n\nThese are much healthier nuts and still taste great.",

    "content": "Depression can be a very tricky issue to treat because it is often individualized to the patient. However, further research has discovered that there are certain natural, non-prescription treatments that may have a positive effect for some who suffer from depression.\n\nOne of the most interesting is deplin, a natural element that is proving to be quite powerful for some in the treatment of their depression, particularly in more serious or severe cases.\n\nDeplin is actually a derivative of folate or Vitamin B9 and is providing to be a potent weapon when it comes to treating depression in thousands of patients. The folate allows the synthesis of important chemical messengers in the brain, such as norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine, the lack of which triggers severe depression and other disorders in the brain.\n\nOne of the common elements to depression is the lack of folate in the body which is why folate supplements have been helping many people fight the effects of depression. However, one issue with many people is that their bodies simply cannot convert simple folate into the L-methylfolate which passes through the \u201cblood-brain barrier\u201d so that it can enter the central nervous system and be effective. In other words, simply consuming folate will not do the job because it will not reach the brain where it is needed.\n\nHowever, deplin is basically folate that is already converted to L-methylfolate and thus can pass into the central nervous system where it can help generate the needed norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine that can then fight off the effects of depression.\n\nThe Uses of Deplin with Other Drugs\n\nDeplin alone has shown to be quite effective. However, when it is combined with Prozac, Zoloft or Paxil, it has been shown to double the response rate to the antidepressant that has been taken. The improvement rate alone is around 84% when used in combination with one of these antidepressants which means that for many people the symptoms can be successfully treated with this powerful combination approach.\n\nPerhaps the best news is that deplin has shown to have no unwanted side effects, making it one of the safest treatments on the market today. For those who are taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitor to treat their symptoms of depression, deplin may very well be a safer and much more effective answer since it helps the body generate that material naturally. This is especially true if the antidepressant taken is not meeting expectations as deplin may really have a powerful impact under these conditions.\n\nWho Should Use Deplin?\n\nThere is a blood test that is now available to determine if a person does lack the enzyme functions to metabolize folate into the L-methylfolate form. This is arguably a test that should be performed on all people who suffer from depression. If the test shows that the folate is not being properly transformed, the deplin may very well be the answer which will treat the symptoms of depression.\n\nIt must be noted that deplin is not the answer for all forms of depression, but for those in which the folate is not being properly transformed, it should be one of the major considerations of doctors for their patients.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Postpartum depression is a state of being that medical science has only recently really began to study. While the effects of this form of depression have been known for many years, the extent to which it can affect women has only recently been understood. While most cases of postpartum depression are mild in nature, there are severe cases in which the person has performed extreme acts which have raised the subject of effective treatment.\n\nFortunately, there are natural treatments for this form of depression that center on wellness and openness about the feelings that are being experienced. The most important aspect for someone who is suffering from this form of depression is that they need to avoid isolation and instead engage with others so that they can successfully overcome the effects.\n\nNatural Methods of Recovery\n\nThis is a form of depression that cannot be treated on its own, but it can be overcome by most women without having to use antidepressant prescription medications.\n\nEat a Healthy Diet: It may sound amazing, but eating a healthy diet is one way to help alleviate the effects of postpartum depression.\n\nExercise: This is another way to help combat the effects of depression. While your workouts do not have to be intense as you can simply walk with your baby or engage in light exercise, it is important to get the blood to flow and the body moving which can help you feel better and more energetic.\n\nAvoid Alcohol: Alcohol is a depressant and will only make a person feel worse. Plus, the aftereffects such as dehydration and the inevitable hangover from overuse will only worsen the condition.\n\nVitamin & Mineral Supplements: There are a number of vitamins that can help a person overcome the effects of postpartum depression. These should be consumed along with eating a healthy meal.\n\nVitamins B6, B9, B12 & C\n\nAmino acids in particular make for effective antidepressant substances since they are often found in the brain\u2019s neurotransmitters. In essence, they can help supplement what the brain may be missing which is causing the depression to occur. Vitamins B6, B9 and B12 help the body convert the folate into L-methylfolate which is used to create substances like serotonin in the brain that helps people to feel better.\n\nMagnesium deficiency is also part of many women who suffer from postpartum depression. By restoring the proper amount, it will help relieve the restlessness, cramps, insomnia and other conditions that commonly occur with this particular form of depression.\n\nIn addition, proper treatment using these natural substances and methods needs patients to really work. There are no overnight cures or instant happiness that accompanies these natural substances. However, as the vitamins, amino acids and minerals are absorbed into the body along with the healthy diet and exercise, people who are feeling the effects of postpartum depression will notice that the signs will start to fade over time. While not immediate, using healthy, natural methods will eventually work in most women who suffer from postpartum depression.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "For men who are having difficulty getting lean and in shape, taking testosterone supplements has certainly helped when their own bodies do not produce them at a normal level. However, is it possible to use other natural substances to boost the body\u2019s own production of testosterone?\n\nThere have been a few studies that suggest an increase in Vitamin D3 may very well help men produce more testosterone in their body once they begin to reach middle age. While there are many who have touted the role the Vitamin D3 has played in greater testosterone production, the studies are still being gathered to see if they indeed offer the best results.\n\nWhy Vitamin D3 May Increase Testosterone Levels\n\nAlthough no definitive studies currently exist, there is still some good evidence to suggest that Vitamin D3 does play a solid role in helping men produce more testosterone naturally.\n\nRelationship of Vitamin D to Testosterone Levels: There has long been a correlation to low Vitamin D levels in the body and low testosterone levels as well. This is especially true in men who are overweight as well. However, an old scientific principle is correlation does not imply causation, so a direct link is needed.\n\nTestosterone Generation: In studies on mice, those that have no receptors for Vitamin D did suffer from less than normal levels of testosterone. This is a stronger indication that Vitamin D plays a role in the production of testosterone.\n\nInhibit Aromatization: In other words, Vitamin D3 helps to inhibit the body\u2019s process of changing testosterone to estrogen in men. This means that more testosterone actually stays in the body of men.\n\nOf course, one of the more interesting factors is if a simple vitamin can actually help the body produce more of anything or does it simply allow for greater production to occur? In and of themselves, vitamins are essential elements of the body that help it maximize performance. But do they really add a new source of materials that can be used for the creation of testosterone?\n\nIs Vitamin D3 a True Booster of Testosterone?\n\nSince almost all generation of testosterone in the male body comes from the testes, the production of this substance uses different elements in order to create the testosterone itself. It is possible that Vitamin D3 plays a role how testosterone is created, but it does seem from the evidence available that it helps the body to produce a little more, but it in and of itself is not a generator.\n\nIn other words, a man increasing his intake of Vitamin D3 would help his body produce more testosterone in modest levels because it aids in the production process. It does not however act as a generator for more testosterone in the body itself.\n\nTherefore, men who are looking to significantly boost their testosterone levels may not find Vitamin D3 sufficient in that regard. However, they may find it helpful as part of an entire system of healthy supplements to the body to get the most natural testosterone production possible.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Thanks to recent studies that show men who increase their testosterone level can actually boost their sex drive, increase lean muscle mass and shed the unwanted fat there have been a number of products that have hit the shelves promising to boost testosterone levels.\n\nEssentially, there are two types of products on the market today. There are testosterone replacement supplements that actually use synthetic testosterone or its DHT equivalent to add to the natural amount that is in the body. This type of supplement is usually prescribed although there are over the counter products that offer a reduced amount.\n\nAnd there are products like the Andro 400 Testosterone Booster that promise to boost the libido, lower cholesterol levels and drop the excess fat by getting the body to increase the amount of testosterone it produces.\n\nBy combining natural supplements such as vitamins, minerals and herbs, Andro 400 is designed to boost the body\u2019s ability to produce more of what is known as free testosterone so that it can in turn have the positive benefits that such amounts will offer.\n\nThe main ingredient in Andro 400 is Eurycoma Longifolia, a medicinal product that has been used in Indonesia and Malaya for centuries to treat a number of illnesses including malaria. The product is also well known as an aphrodisiac and even works for diabetic patients when augmenting their diets.\n\nThere have been numerous studies on the main active ingredient in Andro 400 with mixed results. Some have cited its ability to increase the levels of free testosterone while others have not. What can be said is that it does seem to boost the sex drive and help raise energy levels as well, so the overall effect is a positive one regardless of whether it actually boost the levels of testosterone.\n\nWhat can be said is that there are few, if any real negative side effects to the product when used accordingly. As with any over the counter product, you should check with your doctor if you are taking prescription medication as there is the possibility that they might interact in unforeseen ways. Otherwise, it is recommended that you take the product per directions so that you do not run into any side effects.\n\nIs Andro 400 Right for You?\n\nThe issue is not so much with the product, but with the ingredient itself as it is the main one featured. While Andro 400 Testosterone Booster obviously offers an ingredient that at the very least can boost the energy levels and libido, the ingredient can also be purchased separately for a significantly lower cost.\n\nAfter all, why pay nearly $30 a month when you can just go to your local retail or online store and purchase Eurycoma Longifolia for less? Plus, numerous consumer complaints about the customer service aspects of the company provide even more incentive to go elsewhere and find the ingredient on your own rather than having to pay more than what it is worth and putting up with the hassle.

The product contains the usual number of herbs in an attempt to either provide or at least mimic the ability to boost testosterone in the body.\n\nHowever, like many other natural products the ability to boost testosterone through the use of herbs, minerals and vitamins is quite limited. This is because the body\u2019s reduction in the amount of testosterone produced is a natural process that can be limited in certain ways by eating a healthy diet, exercising and consuming the right combination of supplements, but reversing the process and increasing testosterone production back to their more youthful levels is simply not possible using this approach.\n\nBy work, does it mean that the product has demonstrated in clinical studies as proven to boost testosterone levels? The answer here is no as the Syntheroid Testosterone Booster does not make such claims nor is there any evidence that it does actually boost the overall levels of testosterone in the body.\n\nAt the very least, there are no reported outstanding side effects that might be detrimental to its overall use. However, as with any product of this type it is best to consult with your doctor if you are taking prescription medication to ensure that there is no danger of having an unforeseen reaction.\n\nOne of the main issues that works against this product is the claim that it may produce testosterone levels \u201c400%\u201d higher than what the body is currently producing. This is rather clever deception in advertising because it does not claim to produce specific results, only that it may produce levels at an astounding rate higher than what the body is currently producing.\n\nSo, for a product that costs a considerable amount of money on the shelves, it is rather disappointing that it cannot actually show it produces any real effect on testosterone levels. However, this should be expected of most products of its type because reversing the aging process when it comes to testosterone production has not been demonstrated using over the counter ingredients.\n\nOnly testosterone or its DHT equivalent has demonstrated clinical results in boosting levels of testosterone and that\u2019s because it supplements what the body produces, it does not cause the additional production. So overall, the Syntheroid Testosterone Booster is a product that is long on promises and short on results.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "There are many health supplements on the market today, but few have had the impact of fish oil supplements. Since the turn of the 21st century, fish oil supplements have certainly taken the health world by storm as they provide many benefits to the body. In addition, they can be found in grocery and retail stores everywhere so they are easy to find and fairly inexpensive.\n\nThe impact that fish oil product have on the health has also been studied carefully as well and while most health professionals have acknowledged the benefits that it provides, there are also some aspects that need to be monitored as well.\n\nWhat Are Fish Oil Supplements?\n\nThe fish oil mainly comes from what is extracted from certain marine life when they are caught and processed. Fish oil generally comes from these sources:\n\nTuna, mackerel and herring\n\nHalibut, cold liver and salmon\n\nWhale or seal blubber\n\nIn addition, the fish oil found in stores is often supplemented with Vitamin E to keep it from spoiling along with other vitamins and minerals as well. Fish oil is generally sold in capsules that are meant to be taken after meals and they generally contain about 9 calories per gram.\n\nThe main benefit from fish oil is the Omega 3 fatty acids that are found inside the product. In turn, these fatty acids seem to provide a number of benefits for the body.\n\nThere are certainly many positive benefits that consuming modest amounts of fish oil brings to the body, especially when taken in the proper doses.\n\nSlow Hardening of Arteries: There is powerful evidence that fish oil keeps the arteries loose and more flexible which in turn mean reducing the chances of heart attack and stroke.\n\nEase Pain: The pain caused by the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis may be significantly reduced by the intake of fish oil. In addition, there seems to be a reduction of menstrual pain as well from the use of this product.\n\nIn addition, fish oil has been shown to reduce the risk of macular degeneration as well as protecting pregnant women from a certain type of miscarriage.\n\nAlthough mostly safe for almost everyone when taken in the recommended doses, there are a couple of drawbacks to taking fish oil on a regular basis.\n\nAftertaste: The most common side effect is the aftertaste and occasional \u201cfish burps\u201d that occur as the capsule is breaking down inside the stomach. When taken after meals along with a glass of water or another beverage, these effects are very mild and may not even be present.\n\nRare Side Effects: Although most people will be fine when taking the product in normal doses, there are some who may experience certain side effects that include nausea, mild diarrhea, heartburn, bad breath and even a rash breaking out. If you notice one or more of these symptoms, stop taking the fish oil.\n\nOverall, fish oil is a welcome health product that provides a boost to the body when it comes to protection against the hardening of the arteries which may lead to more serious health conditions.",

    "title": "Radiesse Versus Juvederm | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health-se/radiesse-versus-juvederm/",
    "content": "Radiesse and Juvederm are both beneficial lifting products that a cosmetic surgeon or medical provider may use. Many providers will incorporate both products into their practice. The main difference between the two is that Radiesse usually requires a deeper injection and the outcome is a lift that lasts longer in some areas. On the other hand, using Juvederm allows for corrections to be quickly made if a mistake happens or an event occurs that is viewed as unfavorable.\n\nEach has some unique additional advantages and disadvantages that should be considered before a treatment is performed. Here is a more in-depth look at each one.\n\nThe Strengths and Weaknesses of Radiesse\n\nRadiesse does an excellent job of creating a natural appearance after being injected. It is made from calcium hydroxyapatite, so it has a high level of firmness that can support treatment areas over a longer period of time. When used to treat large wrinkles or creases, it creates a very smooth complexion. Radiesse may also be used for structural supports in weakened areas, such as under the eyes, along the nose, or under the jaw line.\n\nWhen properly installed, a Radiesse treatment can last for up to 18 months. When compared to Juvederm, it tends to be more expensive at a treatment center.\n\nRadiesse also has an advantage in the fact that is doesn\u2019t just have to be used to create lift in the face. Some people may find it beneficial to add this product to the backs of their hands, along an arm or leg, or to fill in places where the skin has recessed to create uncomfortable bone and tendon lines. Because it goes into the deeper fatty tissues, but still isn\u2019t a permanent filler that may cause a problematic infection later on.\n\nThe most common side effect from a Radiesse injection is bruising and perhaps a slight swelling. Because the product is fairly firm, there may also be the possibility of lumps developing over time underneath the skin and this is the primary disadvantage of this product. In the unlikely event that lumps do form, they cannot be immediately removed or corrected.\n\nMany of the outcomes are based on the skill of the person who is performing the treatment, so it is beneficial to select someone who has a high degree of experience using this product.\n\nThe Strengths and Weaknesses of Juvederm\n\nJuvederm tends to be the #1 choice of practitioners for facial injections because it has a more forgiving nature. The results of a Juvederm injection can last for up to 12 months and the product is easier to mold and shape into place when compared to Radiesse. Another added benefit of using Juvederm is that the results can be immediately changed with a simple injection of Hyaluronidase.\n\nJuvederm is primarily used to enhance the fullness of the lips or to provide support for small wrinkles throughout the face.\n\nThe one disadvantage of Juvederm is that it is a thinner product, so more injections are typically required to produce a satisfactory result. Whereas Radiesse tends to correct volume loss, Juvederm is more about treating surface loss since it is injected closer to the surface of the skin.\n\nJuvederm also has a common side effect of bruising when applied and swelling may occur at the injection site. Some people are naturally allergic to the hyaluronic acid that makes up its foundation, which can be problematic if the allergy is slow developing.\n\nWhich One Is the Best To Choose?\n\nIn many clinics, doctors will give the patient the option as to which filler product they wish to use. For sunken cheeks and other large support problems, the best choice tends to be Radiesse because of how firm and long-lasting it tends to be. For simple procedures that are focused on providing fine, more precise results, Juvederm tends to be the better option. Many providers will have a protocol in place, however, that calls for Juvederm for around the lips and Radiesse for other facial features that require a lift.\n\nThe most important component of using either item is the experience and professionalism of the treatment provider. Improper injections of either Radiesse or Juvederm can translate into serious problems. Ask for references before agreeing to any procedure, go through a treatment providers before and after portfolio, and examine their facilities. This will give you the best chance to experience the complete lift results that are wanted.",

    "content": "What\u2019s better for you \u2013 honey or sugar?\n\nSome will say honey is better for your health because it\u2019s more natural. But then again, sugar cane is also natural.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the difference between the two, and is one a more healthy option?\n\nThey are both carbohydrates. This means 1 gram has 4 calories, similar to protein. While 1 gram of fat has 9 calories.\n\nBoth contain two forms of sugar: glucose and fructose.\n\nThe proportions of glucose and fructose in honey and sugar slightly differ: sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose while honey contains 40% fructose and 30% glucose\n\nThe remainder of the 30% of honey consists of water, pollen, and small amounts of minerals & vitamins, including magnesium and potassium.\n\nThese additional components may be responsible for some of the health benefits of honey.\n\nBoth Are Carbs They will increase your blood sugar levels, especially when consumed by themselves and in high dosages. This isn\u2019t good if you already have high blood sugar levels, pre-diabetic or diabetic.\n\nHigh Glycemic Index Sugar has a glycemic index of 65; while honey has a glycemic index is 58. As you can see, they are very similar.\n\nIdeally, you would eat lower glycemic foods since it\u2019ll keep your blood sugar stable, mood, and energy levels stable, and having healthy blood sugar levels is extremely important for every aspect of your health \u2013 body, brain, muscles, fat loss, mood, longevity etc.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve got more details about proven ways to naturally have healthy blood sugar levels, while still eating carbs.\n\nThe Positives (of Honey)\n\nNow, are there any positives to eating sugar or honey?\n\nWell, when it comes to sugar the answer is NO \u2013 so I don\u2019t waste any more time on this one food.\n\nBut, what about honey?\n\nIn ancient times it\u2019s been used as both a sweetener and natural medicine.\n\nHoney does have nutrients that sugar does not, but only trace amounts of amino acids, antioxidants, enzymes, minerals, and vitamins\n\nHoney has been used as a cough suppressant for people who have bronchitis.\n\nIt\u2019s even been used for wound healing as a safe treatment for chronic wounds, ulcers, and burns.\n\nHoney also seems easier to digest than sugar, due to the naturally added enzymes from the bees because the sugars are already partially broken down.\n\nThe Negatives (of Honey)\n\nNow, there are a couple of disadvantages of honey:\n\nIt has more calories than sugar; 64 vs 49 calories per tablespoon.\n\nIt\u2019s not safe to give honey to babies younger than 12 months because bacterial spores can cause infant botulism, a rare but potentially life-threatening disease.\n\nIf you had to pick one sweetener, pick honey over sugar. Choose dark honey if possible, raw varieties are best because they contain more nutrients, antioxidants, and enzymes.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that at the end of the day, it all gets converted to the same thing, it\u2019s extra empty calories that cause high blood sugar and insulin levels.\n\nHere are the best, fastest, and easiest ways to have youthful and healthy blood sugar levels \u2013 so, make sure you take a look.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/is-himalayan-salt-toxic-is-it-any-better-than-regular-salt/",
    "content": "I got asked the other day the following question, which I almost blew off before I did some more research about it. Thus, I wanted to share it with all of my subscribers:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 I have blood pressure problems and I was watching your videos about lowering it and so far, in the past 3 months, I\u2019ve been able to get off of my blood pressure drugs by using your diet changes and supplement recommendations. However, I have a question about Himalayan Salt \u2013 I read that it\u2019s toxic? Is this true? I thought it was natural and good for you and better than regular white table salt? I\u2019m super confused. What do you say?\u201d\n\nBefore I start with the Himalayan salt topic, I want to point out the fact that blood pressure problems are NOT caused by adding some salt to your foods. Salt isn\u2019t even the primary cause of blood pressure problems \u2013 it\u2019s more of a hormonal imbalance and aging thing.\n\nI know this because my dad\u2019s side of the family has blood pressure problems and because of this, I had to learn how to support healthy levels naturally. More about this later.\n\nHimalayan Salt & Lead Poisoning?\n\nIn regards to Himalayan salt being toxic?\u2026 My first thought was, \u201cno, it\u2019s not. And anything in excess will be toxic, including water\u201d.\n\nHowever, before I replied back with a quick \u201cno\u201d, I decided to do some research.\n\nAnd yup, I found a few articles stating that Himalayan salt is in fact, toxic. Or, it \u201ccould\u201d be toxic due to higher levels of lead, which is a heavy metal and you don\u2019t want this in your body.\n\nJust to let you know, lead is a naturally occurring element found in your body, the environment, and in the foods we eat. Heck, it\u2019s even in the air we breathe.1 But you just don\u2019t want anything extra added if possible.\n\nAnyway, the amount of lead in Himalayan Salt is very, very small. It\u2019s nothing to be concerned about unless you\u2019re having tablespoons full of it daily. In this case, you\u2019ll have other health issues.\n\nNow, I have Himalayan Salt daily \u2013 probably half a teaspoon full.\n\nAnd these days, I have more Celtic Salt instead. It is slightly healthier. The only negative is that it\u2019s a \u201cwet\u201d salt. So, you can\u2019t put it in a salt shaker because it\u2019ll stick to the walls and it won\u2019t come out.\n\nSo, you just take a pinch and put it on your food.\n\nNow, a lot of people state how Himalayan salt is so healthy because it has about 84 trace minerals, including potassium, calcium, iodine, magnesium, iron, zinc, and others. Which sounds great\u2026\n\nHowever, the reality is that there are just very small amounts of these minerals, nothing that\u2019ll make much of a difference in your life.2\n\nAs you can see, table salt may have more sodium, but pink Himalayan salt contains more calcium, potassium, magnesium, and iron.2\n\nAgain, amounts that are not worth even mentioning.\n\nHow Does It Compare To White Table Salt?\n\nAnd since we\u2019re speaking about regular white table salt, what are the main differences, pros, and cons as it compares to Himalayan Salt?\n\nHonestly, the only real benefit to regular white salt is if you get the iodized version, which contains iodine. These days, many people are actually deficient in iodine, which is a shame since it has many benefits.\n\nOne of the main ones is improving thyroid function. Thus, if you are having a hard time losing weight and thus, may have a slower metabolism due to less thyroid production, taking iodine will help speed up your thyroid and increase the levels.\n\nSo, you can take it as an iodine supplement, eat more seaweed, or take iodized salt.\n\nHowever, white salt does have extra additives you may not want, such as fluoride, which is a toxin. Also, anti-caking agents to prevent the grains from sticking together.\n\nRemember how earlier I said how Celtic Salt is \u201cwet\u201d and sticks together, this is one reason \u2013 no anti-caking agents or additives.\n\nAnd white salt does cost much less than Himalayan and Celtic salts.\n\nSummary & Bottom Line\n\nHimalayan salt isn\u2019t toxic, even though it has very low levels of a toxin called the lead.\n\nOne of the biggest promoted benefits of Himalayan salt is that it contains about 84 trace minerals, but the levels are so low that there are no real benefits.\n\nWhite table salt does have two main benefits: (A) it\u2019s cheaper than Himalayan (B) the iodized version is good for a slow thyroid because it contains iodine.\n\nA big negative with white salt is that it contains additives that you don\u2019t want \u2013 fluoride and anti-caking agents.\n\nSo go ahead and continue using Himalayan salt or do what I do \u2013 use Celtic Sea salt the majority of the time.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry about the added salt raising your blood pressure. The majority of salt in your diet comes from packaged foods. The real cause of blood pressure problems is the change in your hormones due to aging.\n\nYou can get more details about supporting healthy blood pressure and still enjoying eating salt, by visiting the special link, where I reveal how my dad\u2019s blood pressure got healthy in just a few days \u2013 no diet changes or drugs.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nRolfes S., Pinna K, & Whitney E.

    "content": "I\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions about steroids and one of the biggest ones being, \u201cWhat are the consequences after stopping steroids?\u201d\n\nBasically, what happens short and long-term? Good and bad\u2026 positives and negatives?\n\nAnd to begin with \u2013 why should you listen to me? Well, my doctorate degree is in pharmacology and endocrinology.\n\nPharmacology \u2013 is the study of DRUGS. And I\u2019ve also taken it a big step deeper with the study of nutraceuticals \u2013 herbs and plant extracts \u2013 since over 50% of drugs have been based on natural substances found in nature.\n\nEndocrinology \u2013 is the study of hormones.\n\nSo, this makes me a bit of an expert on this topic.\n\nMore importantly, I also have many years of real-life clinical experience dealing with professional athletes and bodybuilders, where I had to redo their entire drug protocols so they can be safer, healthier, and actually get MORE results.\n\nAs far as the positive effects for HEALTHY men taking steroids \u2013 thus, people who are not sick or ill (AIDS or other wasting diseases) \u2013 the only real positive effect of doing a cycle of steroids is that it will actually help you surpass your natural genetics.\n\nOr more accurately, help you get to your \u201climit\u201d, much faster.\n\nAnd thus, after the cycle, you\u2019ll actually be able to KEEP some of the \u201cnewly\u201d grown \u201csteroid-induced\u201d muscle growth.\n\nFor example, you\u2019ll gain 20 lbs of muscle on your 12-week cycle. You\u2019ll end up losing 12 lbs and keep about 8 lbs of muscle. This is the NEW muscle that would have taken you years to gain, but you fast-forwarded the results and grew it all in 3 months.\n\nHowever, this is assuming you do everything correctly \u2014 during, and more importantly, AFTER your cycle\u2026 which is another topic, for a different day.\n\nThis is the only REAL benefit.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to the negatives.\n\nTransient, Short-Term Side Effects\n\nThere are lots of short-term negative effects that will come and go.\n\nAcne \u2013 some will get them, some won\u2019t \u2013 it depends on genetics, your diet, hygiene, and the TYPE of steroids you take. These will go away after your cycle. However, if you pick at them, they can leave acne scars and that\u2019s the only \u201cpermanent\u201d negatives.\n\nLiver Stress \u2013 your liver will be under extra stress with steroids, mainly with orals. Again, after your cycle, your liver enzymes will go back to normal.\n\nFatigue \u2013 many steroids will initially give you more energy. But over time, they can decrease your energy levels, especially with orals.\n\nHigh Cholesterol \u2013 almost all steroids will cause negative effects on your lipid levels. Orals are the worst, but so are most injectables that don\u2019t convert to estrogen. Needless to say, your lipid and cholesterol levels will go back to normal after the cycle. And unless you were doing steroids for many years, your body will heal itself. Make sure you eat healthy foods on your cycle.\n\nHigh Blood Pressure \u2013 like cholesterol, will go back to normal after your cycle. HOWEVER, if it\u2019s elevated too much for too long, you might get a stroke and it could cause renal and kidney problems, which can result in kidney failure and dialysis. This does happen, so keep an eye on your blood pressure.\n\nFor both cholesterol and blood pressure, make sure you take natural supplements during and after your cycle to control both of these problems.\n\nLong-Term, Permanent Side Effects\n\nHair Loss \u2013 now, this is a real problem that NOBODY wants. However, this is caused by genetics and the type of steroids you take. Needless to say, even people with the best genetics will lose hair when you take high doses of steroids, especially certain ones, for long periods of time.\n\nTesticular Shrinkage \u2013 ALL steroids will cause this. There are ways around this, but it\u2019s too complicated to get into in this article. They will grow back after your cycle. However, they will NEVER be as big as they were previous to you ever taking steroids.\n\nInfertility \u2013 did you know that male birth control is steroids, specifically testosterone and also nandrolone-based steroids? This is because exogenous testosterone (from the OUTSIDE) causes your testicles to shrink and thus, stop producing sperm. Now, some guys can still get a woman pregnant even during a cycle, but generally no. However, the REAL problem is that this \u201cinfertility\u201d actually continues even post-cycle for many men. And the longer you\u2019re on steroids, the worse this situation is. And YES, there are ways around this \u2013 but again, too much for this one article.\n\nLoss of Libido \u2013 speaking of which, the above two situations also cause loss of libido in most guys. All steroids will decrease your sex drive, except for pure testosterone. Even with testosterone, too much or too little will also decrease your libido due to conversions to other hormones, specifically estrogens. This is a major issue because this will negatively affect your relationships and this also continues post-cycle for most guys.\n\nMood \u2013 finally, I believe the biggest problem of all is the changes in your mood and mindset. Certain steroids will make you down, gloomy, and depressed. Certain ones will make you aggressive, angry, and short-tempered. These are bad for your relationships. However, the real problem is that these powerful hormones are very addictive \u2013 physically AND emotionally. So, it\u2019s very hard to get off of steroids and STAY off.\n\nJust remember that anything that will turn OFF your natural hormones, specifical testosterone, will cause lots of negative side effects, both short and especially long-term.\n\nGenetics plays a big part in all of this. As does the type of steroids, dosage, and duration.\n\nAnyway, you can do whatever you\u2019d like \u2014 it\u2019s your health. However, make sure you do a lot of research and prepare. And please don\u2019t listen to all the bullshit \u201cbro-science\u201d you read on message boards and so forth. 95% or more of all the information you read about is completely WRONG.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about two potent herbs that can increase your testosterone levels, naturally. One of them is fairly new or has gotten popular recently\u2026 while another one has a much longer history and proven track record.\n\n\u201cDr. Sam, I was watching Joe Rogan interview Dr. Andrew Huberman about a new herb called Fadogia Agrestis [ah-gres-tis] and how he saw testosterone levels go from 200 to 700. That\u2019s like a 350% increase!!! It sounds too good to be true. Have you ever heard of it or tried it?\u201d\n\nYes, I know what it is. Yes, I\u2019ve tried it. Yes, I use it myself. Of course, I use it with other ingredients, which I\u2019ll tell you about in a minute.\n\nSimply stated, if you\u2019re a man, taking Fadogia tells your testicles to produce more testosterone.\n\nFadogia has become popular in the past year or two, probably because of Dr. Andrew Huberman talking about it.\n\nI had known about Fadogia a few years ago myself. Needless to say, it\u2019s a newer herb in the testosterone-boosting supplement world.\n\n350% Increase In Testosterone?!\n\nAs far as the 350% increase in testosterone levels \u2013 that\u2019s probably not the normal response most people will get.\n\nIn my opinion, you\u2019ll get that if your levels are low. If your testosterone levels are medium or even on the higher end, don\u2019t expect such dramatic improvements or increases.\n\nMind you, in the video, he also mentions another herb to use with Fadogia, called Tongkat Ali.\n\nAnd simply stated, Tongkat Ali works by lowering SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin), which will then increase your free testosterone levels \u2013 which is the more active form of testosterone.\n\nNow, Tongkat Ali has been utilized for many years and it has a more proven track record.\n\nNot many products contain both Fadogia and Tongkat Ali.\n\nDon\u2019t forget, there are a few other really powerful herbs as well \u2013 such as:\n\nTestofen\u00ae Fenugreek Extract\n\nTribulus\u2122 Terrestris Extract\n\nPlus, there are other non-herbal ingredients, such as\n\nAnyway, I mention all of this because there is a special synergy between these ingredients when combined together at the correct, clinically proven dosages.\n\nUnfortunately, the biggest challenge is finding all of these ingredients and having to take them separately. It\u2019s time-consuming, not convenient, and can be very expensive.\n\nHowever, the good news is that all of these ingredients, including Fadogia and Tongkat Ali, are found in ONE supplement that I\u2019ve been using for over 20 years, called AlphaViril.\n\nThe main benefit of AlphaViril is that it contains other ingredients that help enhance and boost both total and free testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, it also deals with the negative effects of high levels of female hormones like estrogen, which can lower testosterone levels.\n\nThus, your goal shouldn\u2019t be to ONLY increase your testosterone levels, but also lower excessive levels of testosterone KILLING hormones \u2013 such as estrogens, DHT and stress hormones.\n\nAll of which AlphaViril does, in one pill \u2013 saving me and you, both time and money.\n\nJust know that the combination of proven herbs and minerals, will cause more beneficial positive effects on your testosterone levels, and optimize your key youth hormones.\n\nThe synergy is MUCH more effective, powerful and safer, than taking individual herbs at a higher dose.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

This is what I use in a patent form backed by dozens of human clinical studies. It\u2019s Zinc picolinate called ZINMAX.\n\nZinc comes in capsules, tablets, lozenges, and sprays.\n\nCapsules are the best because they have the least fillers and you can get veggie caps.\n\nNasal sprays containing zinc have been linked to loss of smell and should be avoided.7, 8\n\nMake sure you take zinc with copper in a 10:1 ratio or else it\u2019ll create a copper deficiency and can accelerate graying of hair.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/452949\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5410113\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120804\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3630857\n\nhttps://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/108934\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24259556\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15283486\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16467707",

In fact, in one clinical trial showed this combination helped reduce heart problems by over 50%.\n\nNext are amino acids, specifically two very important ones.\n\nThe first is a special \u201cCarnitine\u201d blend, utilizing Acetyl L-Carnitine, L-Carnitine Fumarate, and Glycine Propinyl L-Carnitine (GPLC). This specific blend dramatically improves circulation and reduces the hardening of the arteries.\n\nThe next is N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC), which helps remove heavy metals and toxins from your blood while boosting your immune system and also cleansing your liver.\n\nAnd finally, the 3 most important herbs for improved blood flow, circulation, and improved vascular flexibility are Nattokinase, White Willow Extract, and Ginger Extract.\n\nNattokinase helps fight Fibrin Buildup, which is an insoluble protein formed from fibrinogen during the clotting of blood. It forms a fibrous mesh that impedes the flow of blood (not what you want).\n\nWhite Willow Extract is a natural form of Aspirin and when used in the proper dosage, helps naturally thin your blood and acts as a natural anti-inflammatory.\n\nAnd finally, Ginger Extract, which is FANTASTIC because it helps:\n\nFight against atherosclerosis, which is the hardening of the arteries\n\nInhibits abnormal platelet aggregation, which is a part of blood that can \u201cclump\u201d together and cause blood clotting.\n\nIncreases contractile strength and ATP production in the heart.\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a natural solution called Blood Flow Optimizer\u2122, which contains the above key ingredients, in specific clinically proven dosages \u2014 in addition to a couple of other helpful ingredients.",

Again, testosterone is a primary reason.\n\nWhen you get older and testosterone levels drop, you start to have a lot more belly fat.\n\nAnother benefit of having optimal testosterone levels is you have a lot more energy. When you\u2019re in your 20\u2019s, you can easily get by with less sleep.\n\nThis is also why older men who have lower testosterone are always tired.\n\nHigher testosterone is correlated with higher libido and sex drive.\n\nIn addition to higher libido, you\u2019ll also have much better, fuller, and harder erections.\n\nOne of the best and safest anti-depressants is higher testosterone levels \u2013 in both men and women.\n\nYou\u2019re happier and more driven.\n\nOne of the pros or cons, depending on how you look at it and your genetic personality is that the increase in testosterone can cause more aggressive behavior.\n\nBe mindful of this if you already have an aggressive personality type.\n\nOptimal hormonal balance and testosterone levels can dramatically improve your immune system and make everything stronger and more resilient.\n\nThe heart is a muscle. And a healthy heart pumps blood to the rest of the body, providing your entire body with the oxygen needed for peak performance.\n\nSadly, low testosterone levels are linked to a variety of cardiovascular risks.\n\nNaturally, high testosterone is good for your muscles and body, as well as your brain.\n\nYour cognition and memory improve, your brain thinks faster, your verbal and math skills also improve.\n\nHigher testosterone levels also mean a fuller and larger penis \u2013 again, since it is a muscle.\n\nYour testicles will also grow in size, ONLY if you increase your testosterone levels naturally \u2013 from within.\n\nBut if you take exogenous testosterone \u2013 such as injections and creams, your testicles will shrink for sure.\n\nFaster Hair Growth During puberty is the hair gets thicker, and also starts to grow much faster.\n\nStronger Bones Testosterone also plays a big role in bone mineral density.\n\nSome simple, easy and natural ways to increase your testosterone levels are in these important videos and articles.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701485/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098904/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22522504/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701485//li>",

    "content": "I hope by now you know the importance of vitamin D and you\u2019ve made the correct decision of taking a supplement to boost your Vit D levels.\n\nBut what form or type you should take?\n\nFirst, it needs to be Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) \u2013 NOT regular D or D2 (ergocalciferol)\n\nSecondly, Vitamin D3 works directly with vitamin K2 [more specifically as MK-7 (trans menaquinone-7)] to help optimize both absorbability and safety.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t take regular K or K1, or the synthetic K3 \u2013 It must be natural K2, specifically as MK-7 (trans menaquinone-7).\n\nOnly take the D3 + K2 forms, together in one pill at the same time. Preferably in the morning with food.\n\nThe best supplement that my family and I take, which utilizes the correct dosage, form, and ratios of the clinically researched versions of these two vitamins is called Perfect Vitamin D&K.\n\nAll you need is one small pill daily and it does it all \u2013 saving you time and money.\n\nIt\u2019ll cost you about 25 cents a day for the most potent and clinically validated forms.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",
