    "content": "I also used to believe all of these myths at some point myself \u2013 because I\u2019ve been lied to, just like you have.\n\nMyth #1: \u201cVitamin D Is Just a Vitamin\u201d\n\nNo, it\u2019s actually a hormone \u2014 more specifically, a steroid hormone.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so powerful at improving your mood, energy, reducing pain, boosting sex drive, immune function, and supporting a healthy brain and heart.\n\nMyth #2: \u201cYou Already Have Healthy Vitamin D Levels\u201d\n\nNo, over 75% of the population are either deficient or have sub-optimal levels.\n\nYou need to be in the high-normal range to support optimal health and longevity.\n\nMyth #3: \u201cYou Can Get Enough Vitamin D from Food\u201d\n\nVitamin D is made when the sun hits your skin and combines with cholesterol (another steroid) to produce it from within.\n\nFoods \u201cfortified\u201d with D usually use the wrong form and include ineffective, low doses.\n\nMyth #4: \u201cSunlight Alone Gives You Enough Vitamin D\u201d\n\nNo, most people don\u2019t get enough sun exposure, especially not year-round.\n\nYou need at least 30 minutes of midday sun on your full body, not just your face or hands.\n\nAging, being overweight, having lower hormones, or darker skin means you need even more sunlight to make the same amount.\n\nMyth #5: \u201cA Multivitamin Covers Your Vitamin D Needs\u201d\n\nNo, multivitamins offer only the bare minimum.\n\nIt\u2019s like asking for money and getting handed a dollar \u2014 it won\u2019t make any meaningful difference.\n\nThese doses are just included for marketing, not for actual health benefits.\n\nMyth #6: \u201cThe Best Form of Vitamin D is in Gel Caps\u201d\n\nNo, gel caps tend to go rancid.\n\nThis is especially true with products like fish oil.\n\nThe best form is plant-based, micro-encapsulated Vitamin D, which is up to 4x more absorbable than standard gel caps.\n\nMyth #7: \u201cVitamin D Works Best on Its Own\u201d\n\nNo, taking Vitamin D3 alone \u2014 especially at higher doses \u2014 can be harmful.\n\nWhy? Because it can cause calcium buildup in your arteries, which reduces blood flow and increases cardiovascular risk.\n\nVitamin D must be taken with Vitamin K2 \u2014 specifically the MK-7 version. K2 helps direct calcium into your bones (where it belongs) instead of your arteries.\n\nThe Best Vitamin D Formula I Personally Recommend\n\nThe best Vitamin D3 + K2 supplement \u2014 the same one I give to my parents, clients and take myself \u2014 is linked below if you\u2019d like to give it a try.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

    "content": "Your body makes Vitamin D from cholesterol when your skin is exposed to sunlight. It\u2019s also found in certain foods such as fatty fish like Salmon and pasture-raised whole eggs, especially yolks.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s very difficult to get enough from diet alone.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that about 1 billion people worldwide have low levels of the vitamin in their blood.\n\nStudies reveal that about 50% of adults in the US are deficient. This number goes up to about 70% in Hispanics and 85% in African-Americans.\n\nThese 5 important warning signs can suggest and warn you that you have low vitamin D levels:\n\nVit D helps boost your immune system. This is one reason people get sick more during the winter, the colder months. Less sunlight and thus, less Vitamin D.\n\nLow levels of vitamin D are linked to fatigue, especially in women.\n\nMy suggestion is to take a balanced Vitamin D3 + K2 supplement and see how you feel after a month or two. If you feel more energized, then that\u2019s a clear sign that you need more D.\n\nPain \u2013 Bone & Back and/or Muscle\n\nVit D helps maintain bone health and strength. So, if you are having bone pain or even back pain, this could be a sign you\u2019re lacking in Vit D.\n\nWhat\u2019s very important to know is that you need to take Vitamin D3 with K2 because they work together by the fact Vit K2 takes excess calcium out of the arteries and puts it directly into the bones- where it belongs.\n\nLow vitamin D causes inflammation, which impairs and slows wound healing.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to have surgery or you notice you\u2019re not healing from regular cuts as fast as you used to, consider supplementing extra Vitamin D3 & K2.\n\nFeeling \u201cBlah\u201d or Unhappy\n\nLastly, \u201cblah\u201d or unhappy is also linked to low levels of Vit D \u2013 we can see this during the summer versus winter months. The more sunlight we get, the happier we tend to be and Vit D is one factor.\n\nIf you tend to be more \u201cdown\u201d or are going through some tough times, you should try higher doses of D3 & K2 and see how you feel during the next few weeks.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling 2 or 3 or more of these 5 symptoms, you might have Vit D deficiency or just even sub-optimal levels.\n\nLuckily it\u2019s a very easy fix \u2013 take Perfect Vitamin D3 & K2 which is what I personally take, and try to get more sun!\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ...

    "content": "I\u2019m recording this in 2025, during the winter\u2026 when it\u2019s cold and flu season. This is also the time people start to gain weight and lose muscle mass and strength.\n\nDuring the winter, there is an increased incidence of sadness or even depression. In fact, it\u2019s been termed Seasonal Affective Disorder or \u201cS.A.D.\u201d\n\nWe also have more aches and pains during the winter, especially after the age of 35. These colder months are also when we feel more fatigued, tired, and less driven.\n\nNow, there\u2019s one main common denominator during this time as well \u2013 less sunlight.\n\nThere\u2019s far less daylight and it\u2019s cold, so everyone is indoors or covered up in jackets and so forth. Less sunlight also means dramatically lower levels of vitamin D \u2013 which is a crucial vitamin.\n\nIn fact, Vitamin D isn\u2019t even a vitamin, it\u2019s technically a HORMONE and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so powerful.\n\nThe sad truth is that even during the summer months with all the sunshine, 1 in 3 people are deficient in Vitamin D. And 2 out of 3, 66% of people have low levels of Vitamin D. So, you can imagine how much worse it is during the cold, winter months.\n\nAnd I mention this because of all the negative health issues I just mentioned\u2026\n\nFat gain & muscle loss\n\nThese are all symptoms of low levels of Vitamin D.\n\nThus, during the winter, even more so than the summer, you need to add in or increase your Vitamin D levels.\n\nAnd since there\u2019s very little sunshine hitting your body during the winter, you need to take Vitamin D in supplement form.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve stated in the previous articles, you need to take Vitamin D3, with vitamin K2. This is because these two fat-soluble vitamins work together to improve absorption and calcium metabolism.\n\nNow, before you go out and buy some vitamin D, please know that not all vitamin D supplements work correctly and some can be very bad for your health because they can cause calcium buildup in your arteries \u2013 which is very bad for blood flow, your brain, and your heart.\n\nThe TYPE of Vitamin D and K matters. Remember, you want D3 + K2.\n\nAs does the dosage and ratio between these two vitamins.\n\nThe clinically researched dose is 125 mcg of D3 + 50 mcg of K2, about a 2:1 ratio.\n\nI use a product called Perfect Vitamin D&K. It\u2019s vegan and not made from sheep oil like most get caplet vitamin D products.\n\nPlus, all you need is one pill daily and a bottle will last you at least 3 months.\n\nVitamin D is one of the must-have vitamins that I take year-round and at a higher dose during the colder winter months. I know for a fact that it\u2019s one big reason I almost never get sick anymore.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

So, it helps optimize many of your youth hormones as well.\n\nVitamin D + Vitamin K\n\nVitamin D works only directly with Vitamin K, to help optimize calcium absorption and minimize negative side effects.\n\nToo much vitamin D or when taken by itself can cause excess calcium to build up in the arteries, which may lead to heart and brain problems.\n\nBasically, it can \u201cclog\u201d your arteries with calcium buildup over time.\n\nOptimal Way To Use Vitamin D\n\nBecause of the calcium buildup of using only vitamin D by itself, it\u2019s best to combine with Vitamin K2 (as MK-7).\n\nVitamin K2 helps promote calcium deposits into your BONES, where it should be and NOT in the arteries.\n\nSo, the combination is ideal for safety and benefits.\n\nCorrect Dose & Form Of Vitamin D + Vitamin K\n\nYou want to use Vitamin D3 + Vitamin K2 (as MK-7).\n\nThe correct daily dose for most people is:\n\nVitamin D3 = 5,000 IU / 125 MCG\n\nVitamin K2 (Mk-7) = 50 MCG\n\nAdditionally, research has shown that the oil-based forms aren\u2019t as good or fresh.\n\nI take a plant-based, micro-encapsulated form, which is the most active, absorbable and bioavailable form.\n\nMy family and I have been taking Perfect Vitamin D3 + K2 for about 10 years now.\n\nIt contains the above correct forms and dosages.\n\nYou take 1 small pill daily, that\u2019s it.\n\nA bottle will last you 3 months (90 days) and it\u2019ll cost only $0.25 cents (a quarter a day).\n\nA great value for the best absorbable and safest forms of Vitamin D3 & K2\n\nGive it a try and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ...

A lot of this depends on the time of day and how hydrated you are.\n\nA pigment called urochrome causes the yellow color in urine.\n\nYour kidneys filter out this byproduct from your bloodstream and it exits your body in urine. The more fluids you drink, the lighter the color of the pigment in your urine. The less you drink, the stronger the color.\n\nDifferent Colors \u2013 Light to Dark\n\nSo, let\u2019s quickly go over the different types of colors, starting with the lighter and ending with the darker, cloudy urine.\n\nRed or Pink Urine While urine that\u2019s red or pink might be from something you ate recently \u2013 like beets rhubarb or blueberries, there are sometimes other causes. Some health conditions can cause blood to appear in your urine, a symptom known as hematuria, including enlarged prostate, kidney stones, tumors in the bladder and kidney.\n\nOrange This can be a cause of dehydration. Vitamin C and carotene in carrots can cause orange-colored urine, but not always. Certain drugs can also be a cause like Rifampicin or PhenazopyridineThe most concerning cause of orange urine is liver disease or jaundice. The orange color is caused by an increase in bilirubin.\n\nBlue Or Green Blue or green urine can be caused by food coloring. B Vitamins can cause your urine to be more fluorescent green. Certain medications like amitriptyline, Propofol or indomethacin can also turn also cause blue/green urine.\n\nLight Brown Light-brown or tea-colored urine can be a sign of kidney disease or failure or muscle breakdown. Extreme exercise, like long-distance running or exercising in extreme conditions, can cause this.\n\nDark Brown In most cases, urine that\u2019s dark brown indicates dehydration. Dark brown urine can also be a side effect of certain medications metronidazole \u2013 Flagyl and chloroquine \u2013 Aralen can cause dark brown urine. Eating large amounts of rhubarb, aloe, or fava beans can cause dark brown urine. Dark brown urine can also be an indicator of liver disease, as it can be caused by bile getting into your urine.\n\nCloudy Cloudy urine can be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It can also be a symptom of some chronic diseases and kidney conditions. In some cases, cloudy urine is another sign of dehydration.\n\nVisual Image & Color Chart\n\nThe biggest cause will always be dehydration. Most people are dehydrated.\n\nSo, just try to slowly add in more water daily. You should have at least one good, almost clear pee every day.\n\nAnd if you do have pink or red urine for a few days or consistently, you should see a doctor.",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and more people are understanding the importance of Vitamin D and starting to supplement it into their diets.\n\nUnfortunately, MOST people are still taking the wrong form & dose\u2026 And/or not combining it with another vital Vitamin\u2026\n\nAnd more so, not taking the BEST dosage to produce optimal and healthy levels of Vitamin D, which is what today\u2019s video is all about\u2026\n\nHow Much Vitamin D Should You Take?\n\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t give you a specific dose.\n\nBefore you can decide how much to take, you need to know what your levels are.\n\nThe best and most accurate way is to do a blood test and measure the 25-hydroxy vitamin D test.\n\nThe ideal range for optimal health should be between 50-75 ng/mL.\n\nThe problem is that you can\u2019t just take a specific dosage of Vitamin D and hope you\u2019ll get to this optimal level.\n\nThere are so many factors that control absorption and conversions \u2013 like other hormones, age, sex, body fat levels, skin color, cholesterol levels, and of course, GENETICS!\n\nAnother Major Problem With Vitamin D\n\nMost Vitamin D is in oil-based gel caplets. It\u2019s made from bodily fluids secreted by sheep\u2019s glands and wool (yuck!).\n\nIt\u2019s what most companies use and it\u2019s cheap and not nearly as good or as safe as the plant-based, organic, wild-harvested version that\u2019s micro-encapsulated \u2026which is 2x more absorbable, bioavailable & fresher than the cheaper version.\n\nAdditionally, you need to take the correct form of Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)\n\nAlso, Vitamin D3 works directly with vitamin K2 to help optimize both absorbability and safety.\n\nAnd don\u2019t take regular K or K1, or the synthetic K3 \u2013 it must be K2, specifically as MK-7 (trans menaquinone-7)\n\nBottom Line & Best Solution For Vitamin D\n\nTake the plant-based, organic, wild-harvested version that\u2019s micro-encapsulated for 2x better absorption.\n\nDon\u2019t take either of these vitamins by themselves.\n\nOnly take the D3 + K2 forms, together in one pill at the same time.\n\nWith that said, I typically suggest most people take 5,000 units/125 mcg of D3 + 50 mcg of K2 (as MK-7), in the morning with a meal.\n\nThe best D3+K2 supplement that my family and I take, which utilizes the correct dosage, form, and ratios of the clinically researched versions of these two vitamins is called \u2013 Perfect Vitamin D&K.\n\nAll you need is one small pill daily and it does it all \u2013 saving you time and money.\n\nIt\u2019ll cost you about 25 cents a day for the most potent and clinically validated forms.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

    "content": "This week is the first time I\u2019ve gotten sick in well over a decade. And no, I never got COVID or the flu\u2026 nor do I ever get vaccines.\n\nAnd this is because having a strong immune system is the KEY to not getting sick and staying healthy for a long time.\n\nHowever, I know exactly why I got sick this time\u2026 Unfortunately, I broke my own \u201cnever get sick\u201d protocol, which is what I\u2019m going to share with you today.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to reveal my 5 best methods to dramatically improve both your immune system and just all-around total health.\n\nYou\u2019ll look, feel, and perform better all the time because of it.\n\nAnd my \u201cnever-get-sick\u201d protocol is something I\u2019ve fine-tuned and perfected over the past 20+ years.\n\nPerpetual, Ongoing Colds\u2026\n\nNow, the unfortunate truth is that when I was younger, I would always get sick. I would have a perpetual, ongoing cold it seemed. Then, at least once a year I would either get a really bad sinus infection or the flu or both.\n\nEventually, I discovered the cause and the solution and I almost NEVER get sick anymore. Maybe a slight 2-day cold in the past couple of decades.\n\nAnd like I said earlier, No vaccines of any kind, ever.\n\nIn fact, I remember when everything changed.\n\nWhen I was going to school, dealing with all the stresses of my medical classes, and working at the same time\u2026 I couldn\u2019t wait for the semester to be over because I was studying so much at the end for the exams and was totally stressed out.\n\nI was counting the minutes before spring or winter break started and I could finally relax and enjoy time with my friends and family.\n\nBut so many times, as soon as the semester ended, I would get really sick. Either sinus infection or the flu or a really bad chest and head cold.\n\nThus, my time to have fun with my friends during the break was instead spent recuperating at home because I was deathly sick.\n\nIt was as if my body knew I was under a lot of stress and it was going to keep me healthy until the minute the stress was over.\n\nAnd later I discovered that\u2019s precisely what is going on in the body.\n\nStress & Your Immune System\n\nShort-term stress and the increase in cortisol and other stress hormones can actually help boost the immune system temporarily.\n\nIt\u2019s designed to help get you through the tough times. But long-term stress just kills the immune system.\n\nAnd the stress is both physical and/or emotional.\n\nIt never fails, during times of extra stress, I do get sick soon after \u2013 IF I don\u2019t take care of my body.\n\nAnd recently, this is exactly what happened.\n\nThis includes me pushing it too hard at the gym when I\u2019m not feeling 100%. You need to know when to back off and give your body time to recuperate.\n\nSo, the first thing we want to do is improve our stress levels. Of course, you can\u2019t always control outside stressors and I\u2019ve got many videos about this topic.\n\nBut the FASTEST way of strengthening your immune system to fight stress is to get better sleep \u2013 which most of us are not doing.\n\nI\u2019ve got a ton of videos about improving sleep, however, let me make it simple for today:\n\nKeep a regular sleep schedule. This means, that whether you go to bed at 9 pm or 1 am, just stick to that same schedule every day \u2013 this includes the weekend if possible. Basically, go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.\n\nPrepare for sleep because it just doesn\u2019t happen on its own. This means that at least an hour or two before bed, stop doing anything that\u2019s going to stimulate your mind and body. Don\u2019t consume information or speak to people or do work that\u2019s going to get you overly emotional.\n\nFor example, I just like watching an episode of Seinfeld. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve already seen them all a bunch of times, so it\u2019s easy, no stress and not stimulating.\n\nI also make sure my room is dark and quiet. I wear earplugs and eye shades.\n\nAnd, 30 minutes before sleep I take my sleep supplements to help ensure I fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, which is:\n\nDeep Sleep Formula, which contains specific herbs and vitamins that help you get deeper, more youthful sleep.\n\nStress & Cortisol Relief, which helps reduce stress hormones\n\n800 mg of Magnesium Glycinate, which helps relax the body and a mineral that most of us are deficient in.\n\nI don\u2019t need anything else since Deep Sleep Formula and Stress & Cortisol Relief contain all the other specific ingredients and herbs\u2026 Which I used to have to buy separately.\n\nThis combination keeps it simple, it\u2019s effective, and saves me a lot of money.\n\nPlease don\u2019t underestimate the importance of sleep for improving your health, especially your immune system.\n\nBacteria & Immune System\n\nAnother reason we get sick is because of bacteria or a virus. But if your gut bacteria isn\u2019t healthy, you\u2019re not going to be healthy, especially your immune system.\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken antibiotics in the past 1-3 years, your healthy gut bacteria is gone. If you eat unhealthy processed foods, your healthy gut bacteria is weak and low.\n\nSo, a few things you can do to improve your gut:\n\nTake a fiber supplement. Yes, fiber helps with healthy gut bacteria. Even a simple psyllium husk will be a good start.\n\nEat foods that are high in natural probiotics, such as fermented foods like yogurt and sauerkraut. I prefer sauerkraut since it\u2019s not dairy and has some fiber\n\nYou can also take pre and probiotic pills. There are so many of them these days, that I can\u2019t really recommend just one. Besides, I think it\u2019s important to change them every 2-4 weeks. So, pick maybe 3 different probiotic supplements. Make sure they are different strains and amounts. Then, take 1 brand for 2 weeks, then switch to the other for the next 2 weeks, and so forth. Our guts have trillions of bacteria, so don\u2019t think one brand is going to be enough. The more variety, the better.\n\nAlso, it goes without saying that having a lot of processed foods, especially sugars, is HORRIBLE for your gut. So, remove the bad stuff and add in the good.\n\nGrowing up, I would always go outside to tan. Of course, as I got older, it just wasn\u2019t a good idea because of wrinkles.\n\nUnfortunately, almost every organism on the planet NEEDS the sun and there are so many reasons for that and one of them is for Vitamin D production for us humans.\n\nIdeally, you would need to get at least 15-30 minutes of sunlight daily, ALL of your body \u2013 not just your arms and legs for example. This would be during peak hours between 10 am to 2 pm.\n\nThe hotter the weather, the closer to the equator, and the sunnier the day, the less sun you\u2019ll need. But at least a minimum of 15 min on your entire body.\n\nWhen we were kids, this was easy. We are always outside running around. Now, we don\u2019t anymore. We are inside all the time or we are covered up when we go outside.\n\nSo at the very least, make sure you add in some Vitamin D3 + K2 supplements. They work together.\n\nI personally take Perfect Vitamin D&K. It\u2019s a highly absorbable, vegan source\u2026 so it\u2019s not made from rancid oil from sheep hair, like most other forms of Vitamin D.\n\nOf course, only a blood test will really tell you where your levels are. I like to keep mine higher, at least 70 or more.\n\nThe funny irony is that my 85-year-old mom needs half the dose of Vitamin D to get the same blood test level as I do.\n\nWho knows why\u2026 it\u2019s just her genetics.\n\nDarker skin, overweight, and older people usually need higher levels to be absorbed properly.\n\nI take 10,000 units or 250 mg daily plus 100 mcg of K2. That\u2019s 2 pills of Perfect Vitamin D&K. But I suggest at least 1 daily, so that\u2019s half the dose I take which is good for most people.\n\nI do take a higher dose during the winter and half the dose in the summer.\n\nNow, whenever I feel like I\u2019m getting sick, I literally double or even triple the dose. So I take a minimum of 20 or 30 thousand units, which is 250 or 375 mg daily. It\u2019s not toxic and I do this for just a few days and it really speeds up the recovery and boosts my immune system.\n\nInstead of being sick for a week, it\u2019s only 2-3 days and less severe.\n\n3 Other Supplements For Immune System\n\nIn addition to the supplements I\u2019ve already mentioned, there are 3 other ones I take daily, especially for boosting my immune system.\n\nVitamin C, at 1000 mg, 3x daily for a total of 3000 mg daily. It\u2019s one of my favorite supplements. It has so many healthy benefits, including the immune system, collagen production, better skin and so forth.\n\nNAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine) \u2013 I take about 500 mg, 2x daily. This is great for boosting glutathione levels, which is super important for immune health. It also helps support liver and kidney health.\n\nReducing Inflammation \u2013 Finally, I take Inflame & Pain Relief to help reduce inflammation. Yes, inflammation is linked to so many health problems. And yes, inflammation is linked to pain.\n\nHowever, when your inflammation is high, it can negatively affect your immune system.\n\nInflame & Pain Relief has all the best ingredients to help support a healthy inflammatory response, such as:\n\n3 different forms of Turmeric/Curcumin extract\n\nOf course, make sure you are well hydrated, and thus, you need to drink plenty of water. Most people are not drinking enough, so at the very least, add in another glass or two of water daily.\n\nIdeally, you should have half of your weight in ounces. So, if you weigh 200 lbs, drink 100 oz of water daily. More at the beginning of the day.\n\nSome people will take Echinacea or Colidiol silver or mushroom extract or similar compounds.\n\nHonestly, if you feel those work for you, go ahead and take them. I know when I\u2019m sick, I\u2019ll do anything to get better faster.\n\nHowever, the supplements I\u2019ve mentioned today are those I take year-round. To make sure my immune system is at its best, all the time, in addition to all the other health benefits.\n\nThe other immune-boosting ingredients such as Echinacea should only be used when you\u2019re sick because, over time, I believe they will stop working and even lower your immune system by decreasing white blood cells.\n\nSo, a quick recap and summary, which I\u2019ve also put all additional information and links below in the description area, is to:\n\nReduce Stress \u2013 both emotional & physical. This also means when you feel like you\u2019re getting a little sick, maybe it\u2019s best to take a couple of days off from the gym and let your body heal.\n\nImprove Sleep \u2013 this is super important for everything health-related, especially your immune system\n\nIncrease Healthy Gut Bacteria \u2013 this means more fiber, fermented foods, and rotating different pre and probiotic pills.\n\nIncrease Sun & Vitamin D+K \u2013 I know it\u2019s hard to get enough sunlight, so that\u2019s why I take a specific, highly absorbable, and vegan source of Vitamin D3+K2\n\nTake 3 extra supplements \u2013 Vitamin C, NAC, and one that helps reduce inflammation.\n\nThis is stuff I do and take year-round. I may up the dose if I feel like I\u2019m getting sick.\n\nUnfortunately, as I stated earlier \u2013 I was not taking all of my usual supplements for the past couple of weeks. Then I was not sleeping well for a few days in a row and well\u2026 I got sick.\n\nSo, I know this formula works. It\u2019s been proven for over 20 years. And it\u2019s not just a healthy immune system, but just all-around total health \u2013 which is what we all want.\n\nMy Favorite Vitamin For A Healthy Immune System\n\nThe above is a great start. Unfortunately, most people just don't have the time or money to implement the above immune-boosting tactics.\n\nHowever, there is ONE vitamin that is super powerful at promoting a healthy immune system. Sadly, most of us are deficient in this vitamin!...\n\nLuckily, just one pill a day can dramatically help strengthen and support your immunity, skin, hair, mood and brain function.",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and boosting your immune system is more important than ever! So, let\u2019s start with today\u2019s health QA:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam, what would you say is the #1 food that will lower my immune system and cause me to get sick more often? What food should I absolutely avoid more than any other food?\u201d\n\nThis is a good question because I think we all hate getting sick. Whether it\u2019s the common cold or a bad flu. It\u2019s just such a waste of time. We get nothing done when we are sick. We can\u2019t even enjoy time off when we\u2019re sick since we feel miserable.\n\nThere are a lot of things we want to optimize to help boost our immune system.\n\nThe obvious ones are things such as moving more and exercising regularly.\n\nGetting fresh air, eating natural foods, drinking plenty of water.\n\nHaving positive interactions with other people helps minimize your stress. Yes, being alone or feeling lonely is not good for your health or immune system.\n\nPeople underestimate the power of deep-quality sleep, which I think is super important for health and a strong immune system.\n\nMost don\u2019t know the importance of getting specific vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin C and zinc \u2013 which should be taken with copper. And one of the most powerful ones is Vitamin D, which should be taken with vitamin K.\n\nSpecific Food That Can Destroy Immune System\n\nHowever, when it comes to one specific food that can potentially destroy your immune system and all-around health?\u2026 I would probably say it\u2019s sugar and similar compounds.\n\nFirst, most people consume too much sugar, more than the body is designed to handle.\n\nIf you\u2019re not consuming sugar directly, it\u2019s found in high amounts in most processed foods. So, it\u2019s hard to get away from it unless you are aware of it and know what to look for.\n\nSugar can obviously lead to blood sugar problems & possibly diabetes.\n\nSugar can also cause high blood pressure, high cholesterol & triglycerides, and poor blood flow.\n\nSugar also negatively affects your emotions, by causing negative mood changes, anxiety, and depression.\n\nWorst of all, it can cause an increase in extra stress hormones, which can obviously lead to lots of other health problems.\n\nWhy Sugar Is Bad For Immune System\n\nNow, before I tell you about all the various types of bad sugar you should avoid, especially those that are hidden or named something else.\n\nLet\u2019s first discuss WHY and HOW excessive sugar intake can impact your immune system:\n\nInflammation: High sugar intake can contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation in your body. Chronic inflammation negatively affects the immune response, making it less efficient in combating infections.\n\nReduced White Blood Cell Function: Research suggests that high levels of sugar in the bloodstream can impair the function of white blood cells, which are crucial components of the immune system responsible for fighting off infections.\n\nReduced Nutrient Absorption: Diets high in sugar and processed foods, lack essential nutrients crucial for proper immune function, potentially leading to deficiencies that can weaken the immune system. Magnesium, zinc, specific amino acids and many more.\n\nDisruption of Gut Microbiota: Excessive sugar consumption can disrupt the balance of gut bacteria, impacting the gut microbiota\u2019s diversity. Since a significant portion of your immune system resides in the gut, this imbalance negatively affects immune function. This can cause bacterial infections.\n\nIncreased Susceptibility to Infections: Studies suggest that consuming large amounts of sugar may increase susceptibility to certain infections by weakening the body\u2019s defense mechanisms. This can cause viral infections.\n\nBasically, sugar itself isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s what sugar does to the rest of your body and mind, that becomes the real problem.\n\nDifferent Forms Of Sugar\n\nSugar comes in many forms. Of course, are all know of regular white table sugar. But:\n\nsyrups \u2013 such as high fructose corn syrup,\n\nand all of these different named compounds or foods, work the same as regular white sugar in the body.\n\nDon\u2019t fool yourself or fall for the false marketing that any of these are different better or healthier than regular sugar. It\u2019s all the same junk.\n\nThis also goes for fruit juices. There\u2019s very little difference between a glass of orange juice vs a glass of soda.\n\nFor example, I have a friend who gets a green drink smoothie every day, thinking that it\u2019s healthy. After all, the drink is green. But, when you look at the ingredients, it contains apple, pear, pineapple, and a bunch of other fruit juices added with the parsley or celery.\n\nSimply stated \u2013 If it tastes sweet, and has a lot of carb calories, it\u2019s got added sugar.\n\nI have no problem with eating fruits. Eating an orange is far better than having a glass of orange juice which is like 10 oranges, without the health benefits of the fiber. It takes a while to eat 10 oranges. It takes seconds to drink a glass of orange juice made from 10 oranges.\n\nEven Worse Than Sugar\u2026\n\nAnother sugar\u2019s even worse and that\u2019s alcohol sugar. Yes, alcohol is sugar. It\u2019s worse because it negatively affects your organs and brain.\n\nSo all of you who think you\u2019re doing your body some good by having a couple of glasses of wine every night, that\u2019s just another marketing scam.\n\nThere\u2019s no resveratrol in wine and if there was, it doesn\u2019t do anything.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no health benefit to ethanol and alcohol sugar.\n\nOf course, alcohol can taste good or make you feel good or have a good time. That\u2019s fine. But let\u2019s not lie to ourselves and say that it\u2019s GOOD for your health, even in moderation.\n\nDrink alcohol because you want to have a \u201cgood time\u201d, don\u2019t do it to help improve your health \u2013 especially your immune system.\n\nI would have listed \u201cprocessed foods\u201d as a major problem. But these days, almost all foods are processed. So, that\u2019s a bit too vague.\n\nSo do yourself a favor\u2026 read the labels and lower your sugar consumption.\n\nI\u2019ve got a detailed, \u201cnever get sick again\u201d video about the best tips, foods, and supplements to boost your immune system so you almost never get sick again and have a ton of energy.\n\nMy Favorite Vitamin For A Healthy Immune System\n\nThe above is a great start. Unfortunately, most people just don't have the time or money to implement the above immune-boosting tactics.\n\nHowever, there is ONE vitamin that is super powerful at promoting a healthy immune system. Sadly, most of us are deficient in this vitamin!...\n\nLuckily, just one pill a day can dramatically help strengthen and support your immunity, skin, hair, mood and brain function.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/the-truth-about-cold-showers/",
    "content": "A few months ago, in 2025, my hot water heater broke. So, I had only cold running water in my home. It happened on a Friday afternoon and I needed to take a shower and go out for the evening. There was no time to call a plumber.\n\nMy only option was to \u201cman up\u201d and take a cold shower.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I did.\n\nUnfortunately, I quickly learned that maybe I wasn\u2019t man enough because the water was damn cold. And certain parts of my body felt like ice water\u2026 if you know what I mean.\n\nSo I took a super quick shower and got out in like 5 minutes.\n\nBut something interesting happened \u2013 I felt really energized after the shower. It actually put me in a good mood and I felt refreshed the rest of the night.\n\nAnd since the plumber couldn\u2019t make it out until Monday, I ended up taking cold showers the rest of the weekend and to my surprise, I noticed a few other benefits.\n\nGranted, this didn\u2019t mean I was going to give up my regular warm showers.\n\nSo, let me quickly give you some of the benefits of a cold shower, as well as simple guidelines.\n\nBenefits Of Cold Showers\n\nI already mentioned how it can wake you up. This is because of higher oxygen intake, faster heart rate, and higher adrenal levels and endorphins, causing more alertness.\n\nCold water, similar to an ice bath, but not as powerful, lowers body temperature, reduces inflammation, and improves circulation.\n\nThis can also help boost recovery after a workout, by reducing soreness, aches, and pains.\n\nThe lowering of inflammation is also good for anyone who has acne, itchy skin and is suffering from hair loss. All three conditions being in an inflammatory response.\n\nPlus, cold water doesn\u2019t dry your skin and hair, unlike hot water.\n\nBeing cold is thermogenic and thus, it causes your body to turn up your temperature. In fact, your body will generate heat by burning brown fat, which can help with weight loss.\n\nDoing It The Right Way\n\nAs with most things in life, there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way to do things.\n\nIf you want to start giving cold showers a try, do so gradually.\n\nMaybe at the end of a regular shower, turn the water to a cooler temperature for 2-3 minutes and see how you feel.\n\nNext time, turn it down even colder, again for 2-3 minutes.\n\nThe third time, turn it to completely cold water and do so for a minute and gradually work up to 2-3 minutes.\n\nI don\u2019t suggest taking cold showers for 10 minutes or longer.

    "content": "As I\u2019ve stated in the past, I just hate being sick. I mean, everyone does, right?\n\nIt just drains you mentally, physically, emotionally. And you can\u2019t do anything or even enjoy doing nothing because you\u2019re in pain and you\u2019re suffering.\n\nSadly, growing up I was always sick.\n\nI got really bad bronchitis when I was young and that turned into asthma.\n\nThe kind that I\u2019d wake up in the middle of the night, gasping for air, as if I was underwater and I couldn\u2019t breathe and the harder I tried, the more my throat seemed to close off.\n\nIn fact, the first time I had my asthma attack was in the middle of the night and I was afraid to go to sleep the next couple of nights because I didn\u2019t want to die.\n\nI then took asthma drugs and it was a miracle, everything was fixed.\n\nIt\u2019s probably one of the reasons I got into medicine I think.\n\nThen in my 20s, I was sick a lot more than I should have been.\n\nA perpetual cold that never seemed to go away.\n\nThen the yearly sinus infections\u2026. Where it felt like I had 20 cavities because everything in my face hurt.\n\nMind you, this entire time I\u2019m eating healthy, exercising, no drugs or alcohol, or anything bad.\n\nJust school, work, and the gym.\n\nI\u2019d have school during the day and then I\u2019d work nights and weekends as well, with my own business\u2026\n\nAnd that was the problem \u2013 I was pushing myself all the time, especially at the gym.\n\nNo matter how I felt, even if I was tired, if it was supposed to be a heavy leg day, I\u2019d do it. I\u2019d push and push. I never backed down.\n\nI was determined to get stronger and grow every single workout.\n\nI\u2019d leave the gym feeling like junk as if I just got done wrestling King Kong or something.\n\nMy hands and legs would be shaking because my adrenaline glands were fried and my stress and cortisol levels were through the roof because of the crazy workout I just did.\n\nOf course, this also ruined my sleep, which made all of this 10x worse.\n\nThe end result was I was always tired, I felt burned out, I was irritable, had horrible sleep, and had the opposite results at the gym \u2013 I was getting smaller, weaker, and fatter.\n\nNot to mention, my sex drive was horrible because my testosterone was super low from all of the physical stress.\n\nAnd if I was dieting to get lean and \u201cripped\u201d, well\u2026 all of this was much worse.\n\nObviously, this frustrated me even more.\n\nOf course, down deep I knew better\u2026 I knew I needed more balance and all of these things.\n\nBut you know, when you\u2019re young and driven and passionate or even obsessed about improving something\u2026. You lose sight of what\u2019s important.\n\nBoosting My Immune System\n\nThen one day, when I was super sick, I decided to look at my journal notes and I saw patterns that started to explain why and when I\u2019d get sick.\n\nWhat triggers caused my immune system to crash.\n\nI just knew that I couldn\u2019t keep going like this.\n\nAnd after lots of experimenting and testing different immune-boosting tactics and so forth, I finally found out what works for me, and then I applied it to others.\n\nThen I took the best tactics that worked for almost everyone, which were easy to implement and gave fast results and I would then just give the same protocol to my friends, patients, and clients.\n\nAnd to make a long story short, for the past couple of decades, I\u2019ve rarely gotten sick.\n\nEspecially in the past decade as I\u2019ve fine-tuned things even more.\n\nI can\u2019t remember the last time I ever got the flu and I never get the flu shot.\n\nIf I start to feel a little cold coming on, I know exactly why, and within 2-3 days, it\u2019s totally gone because I make some lifestyle changes and add in a ton of extra supplements.\n\nAnd I no longer get sinus infections either, which is awesome.\n\nAs far as my clients and patients, similar results.\n\nPeople with genetic auto-immune problems are so much healthier.\n\nPeople who have diseases and bigger health issues are also feeling so much better and energized.\n\nEveryone can tell that their body is just more resilient and stronger, like when you\u2019re younger.\n\nBoosting YOUR Immune System\n\nOkay, so how does this all apply to you?\n\nBoosting the immune system is two parts.\n\nFirst we need to REMOVE the negative, which is lowering your immune system.\n\nSecond, we need to ADD in the positives, which will improve your immune system.\n\nThis is what makes you almost bulletproof.\n\nI\u2019ve put together an entire email and video series about this. You can get access to it for free, by visiting the links below.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t want you to leave empty-handed.\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to give you the 3 best, easiest and quickest ways to boost your immune system.\n\nHands down, sleep fixes almost anything.\n\nSo, you must get better sleep.\n\nNot necessarily MORE sleep, even though many people need to do this as well.\n\nBut BETTER and DEEPER sleep is the key.\n\nThis also means NOT taking drugs to help you sleep \u2013 this includes prescription, over the counter, alcohol, and marijuana.\n\nAll of these impede deep REM sleep, which means your body doesn\u2019t heal and repair properly.\n\nAgain, I go much deeper into how to do all of this in my email/video series, and you get access to it below.\n\nBut do your best to go to bed earlier and turn off and dim all the lights. Give sleep a bigger priority.\n\nJust like sleep, we need the sun \u2013 all organisms do. It has amazing healing powers.\n\nIn the morning, go outside, take a 10-20 min walk, breathe deeply, get sun on your body and face. No sunglasses either.\n\nThis boosts your immune system, increases vitamin D \u2013 which most people are deficient in.\n\nIn fact, I suggest taking extra Vit D and K\u2026\n\nThe right form and dose are also very important and I talk about this in my email/video series that\u2019s linked below.\n\nGetting sun first thing in the morning also helps improve your sleep at night by improving melatonin production, which boosts your immune system.\n\nAdditionally, the sun has many antimicrobial and antibacterial benefits. It\u2019s super powerful and healthy.\n\nStress is a major immune suppressor because of the negative effects it has on your hormones.\n\nAs stress hormones such as cortisol go up, there\u2019s a cascade of negative effects\u2026 such as lower testosterone levels, growth hormones, thyroid levels, and an increase in insulin.\n\nNot to mention other immunosuppressive chemical changes and whole-body inflammation.\n\nPlus, negative changes in your sleep and lower melatonin levels.\n\nLots of negative changes due to stress!\n\nThe problem is that stress shows up in many ways and forms.\n\nFor me, it was too much exercise and work, not enough sleep. Plus, over dieting was very stressful for my body as well.\n\nFor others, it can be emotional stress \u2013 money, relationships, and so forth.\n\nAnd for many people, it\u2019s just the negative, inner dialog they have with themselves \u2013 which is the worst of all.\n\nAgain, I cover all of this in my email and video series that you can get access to below.\n\nHowever, today think about situations or people in your life that cause you unnecessary stress.\n\nAnd then, see how you can reduce these \u201cstressors\u201d.\n\nFor example, for me it\u2019s super easy \u2013 I don\u2019t watch the news. It\u2019s always negative.\n\nAlso, stop wasting your time worrying about things you have no control over, such as the past or the future.\n\nNow, there are lots of things you can do to boost your immune system and I cover the most important ones in my email/video series which you can get access to for free.\n\nJust click on this special link!\n\nBut at the very least, make sure you:\n\nGive sleep a bigger priority.\n\nTake a walk every morning outside and get some sun.\n\nTry to reduce stressors in your life.\n\nMy Favorite Vitamin For A Healthy Immune System\n\nThe above is a great start. Unfortunately, most people just don't have the time or money to implement the above immune-boosting tactics.\n\nHowever, there is ONE vitamin that is super powerful at promoting a healthy immune system. Sadly, most of us are deficient in this vitamin!...\n\nLuckily, just one pill a day can dramatically help strengthen and support your immunity, skin, hair, mood and brain function.",

    "content": "For those who suffer from gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) understand that taking the right medication for their heartburn means making a careful decision. After all, taking the wrong medication may mean experiencing symptoms that are even worse than before. So, it is not surprising that medications labeled as protein pump inhibitors (PPI) which reduce the amount of acid the stomach produces are some of the most popular on the market today.\n\nThe proton pumps in your stomach produce the hydrochloric acid which helps break down the food that you consume. In fact, stomach acid is really a good thing as it aids digestion. However, when it comes into contact with your esophagus it can end up burning the tissues inside and cause coughing, pneumonia and even asthma in certain cases.\n\nArguably the two most common brands, Prilosec and Nexium, have accounted for much of the market when it comes to PPI medications. They are both highly publicized and reap many millions of dollars for their manufacturers. However, since these drugs operate on the same basic principle of PPI, just how much are they different in terms of their effects?\n\nBoth Prilosec and Nexium inhibit the action of the proton pumps in your stomach and they are generally taken about a half-hour before eating so that the stomach does not produce the amount of acid it normally would when it comes into contact with food. In addition, both medications will need several days of use before they reach full effect.\n\nIn addition, both of these drugs are generally prescribed for similar conditions which includes having GERD, heartburn, inflammation of the esophagus, ulcers in the stomach and duodenal and having Zollinger-Ellison syndrome where the stomach produces too much acid.\n\nThe differences between each medication are relatively minor as they both work in the same basic way to control the amount of stomach acid that is being produced. In addition, the chemical structure of both medications is relatively similar as well.\n\nHowever, there are some differences between the medications that are based on the many studies that have been performed over the years on each drug. This means that depending upon the particular conditions that a person suffers from, they may benefit from taking one drug over another.\n\nAccording to published studies, Nexium does seem to have a better effect on the conditions created by GERD than Prilosec as well as providing slightly faster relief as well. Basically, it was found that after the first week those who took Nexium enjoyed better overall relief than Prilosec, but after that week was over with both drugs had the same effect.\n\nThese differences however are indeed minor for most people and the main one that many will be looking for is the price. Since both drugs are now available over the counter, that price difference may be dropping as well which means that for most people taking either Nexium or Prilosec will not make much difference in terms of the relief that they enjoy over the long term.",

    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is super important \u2013 not only for allowing you to live a much healthier life, one with a higher immune system, more energy, a happier mood, and decreased health problems.\n\nBut also on the flip side, if doing this wrong \u2013 you\u2019ll actually increase your risk for osteoporosis and getting heart problems.\n\nSo, today\u2019s topic is about the fact that you MUST take two super vitamins together.\n\nNow, let\u2019s first start with our star player \u2013 Vitamin D.\n\nVitamin D is easily one of the most valuable vitamins you should be taking daily.\n\nSadly, 90% of the population is deficient in this \u201csunshine\u201d vitamin and most are certainly NOT at the optimal level.\n\nIn fact, Vitamin D is not technically even a Vitamin. It\u2019s a hormone\u2026 That\u2019s why it\u2019s so powerful.\n\nSadly, the older we get, the less Vitamin D our body produces and absorbs.\n\nAnd the higher your body fat, the lower your D levels.\n\nAnd the less youthful hormones you have, the lower your Vitamin D.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, those of us who are taking Vitamin D in supplement form is taking the WRONG form.\n\nThis includes me a few years ago because I was just listening to everyone else and all the so-called, \u201cexperts\u201d.\n\nYou see, most Vitamin D comes in oil caplets.\n\nBut did you know that not only is this the cheapest and least absorbable form\u2026 But it comes from an animal by-product called \u201csheep grease\u201d.\n\nYes, oil-based forms of Vitamin D are actually derived from bodily fluids secreted by sheep\u2019s glands and wool (yuck!).\n\nThe best form is actually the micro-encapsulated, powdered form.\n\nAnd I only discovered this about 7-8 years ago after doing tons of blood work on myself, family members, and clients.\n\nAnd here is a link to one of the best Vitamin D products in the world and it\u2019s called Perfect Vitamin DK\u2122\n\nIt\u2019s 100% plant-based, vegan, certified organic, and wild-harvested.\n\nPerfect Synergist Combination\n\nNow, I mention Perfect Vitamin DK\u2122 and it\u2019s named \u201cperfect\u201d for a reason\u2026\n\nBecause it contains the correct form of micro-encapsulated Vitamin D3, combined with a patented Vitamin K2 as MK-7 (MenaQ7\u00ae trans menaquinone-7)\n\nThis synergist combination is the key and what I want you to pay attention to.\n\nPerfect Vitamin DK\u2122 also uses the correct clinically validated dose of about a 2.5:1 ratio.\n\nWhich is 125 mcg (5,000 iu) of D3 with 50 mcg of K2/MK-7.\n\nWhy is Vitamin K2 so important?\u2026\n\nBecause as fantastic as Vitamin D3 is, it works as a team, together with Vitamin K2.\n\nYou see, when taking the correct higher dose of Vitamin D3 to increase your levels when measured in a blood test [25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D], the D3 can actually cause hypercalcemia, which is excessively high levels of calcium in the blood.\n\nThis can lead to BVC \u2013 which is Blood Vessel Calcification.\n\nSo many people are focused on high cholesterol levels, that they completely miss this major cause \u2013 which is D3 taken by itself.\n\nThis basically means that calcium phosphate starts to accumulate in the blood vessels, which is a primary underlying cause of heart disease.\n\nThis means more calcium and plaque in the arteries, less blood flow and then add in higher cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, and hormonal imbalances and you have the perfect recipe for heart problems.\n\nScientists have also discovered that low levels of Vitamin K2 as MK-7, ALSO increase BVC \u2013 which means more calcium in your blood vessels, narrowing your arteries and thus, potentially leading to heart problems.\n\nBy the way, over 90% of people are also deficient in Vitamin K2 as well.\n\nSo, low levels of both D3 and K2 are bad. However, taking D3 by itself is also bad.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s where the magic starts\u2026\n\nWhen you combine the correct form and dose of D3 with K2, your risk for heart disease drops because there\u2019s much less calcification in the blood vessels.\n\nSimply stated, vitamin D may cause blood vessel calcification, while vitamin K may help prevent this from happening.\n\nAnd one of the primary ways this happens is because vitamin K2 takes calcium OUT of the blood vessels and puts it directly into the bones, where it\u2019s supposed to go.\n\nThis obviously reduces osteoporosis and creates stronger bones, and blood vessels, and improves cardiovascular and heart health.\n\nThis is exactly what we need after the age of 35, especially for women who have dealt with menopause.\n\nVitamin D3 is a super \u201chormone\u201d vitamin that we should all be taking because of the dozens of health benefits.\n\nHowever, taking D3 can cause calcium deposits in your blood vessels and arteries, which can lead to heart problems.\n\nSo does low levels of Vitamin K2, which over 90% of people are deficient in.\n\nTaking K2 with D3, takes the calcium out of the blood vessels and puts it into the bones, where it\u2019s supposed to be \u2014 thus, creating stronger bones, reducing osteoporosis, and reducing your risk of a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThe best form, most absorbable form is the plant-based, powdered, micro-encapsulated pills, NOT the oil form.\n\nAnd what I\u2019ve been using for\n\nthe past few years is Perfect Vitamin DK\u2122 because it contains the correct patented forms, backed by over 25+ clinical studies, at the scientifically validated dose of 2.5:1 ratio for maximum safety, bioavailability, and absorbability.\n\nAnd the best part, it only costs a few pennies a day.\n\nSo if you\u2019re not using D3 and K2 together, make sure you start today.\n\nAnd if you are, great\u2026 but it\u2019s better to use the vegan, powdered micro-encapsulated version only found in Perfect Vitamin DK\u2122.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26995293 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23109644 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406296 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22516723 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15514282 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18722618\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26995293 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23109644 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406296 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22516723 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15514282 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18722618\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26995293 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23109644 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406296 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22516723 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15514282 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18722618\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26995293\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23109644\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406296\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22516723\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15514282\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18722618",

    "content": "Vitamin D is super important for dozens of health reasons and it\u2019s a vitamin that most of us are deficient in.\n\nOf course, people always ask me how they can get vitamin D naturally, especially from food \u2013 today I\u2019m going to reveal the 2 best and ONLY food sources high in vitamin D.\n\nMost protein does NOT contain vitamin D, unless they are \u201cfortified\u201d with added Vitamin D.\n\nThe truth is, it\u2019s not enough and you might as well just take a pill that has much higher levels and the correct form \u2013 which is Vitamin D3 + K2.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is the OILS in fish contain the majority of Vitamin D. This is why you want fatty fish such as Salmon or Rainbow trout. Again, these need to be wild and caught getting natural sunlight, not farm-raised.\n\nVegetables don\u2019t really have much Vitamin D, except for ONE, which is Mushrooms. The best ones are Crimini (Chestnut), Portabella, and Maitakes.\n\nAnd ONE cup of these mushrooms averages about 1000iu / 25 mcg.\n\nAs far as fruit, forget about it. The only one is orange juice and that\u2019s only if it\u2019s \u201cfortified\u201d, like with Milk.\n\nBesides, my opinion is that all juices are bad since it\u2019s just straight sugar.\n\nGetting your vitamin D from foods or even a multivitamin is not a good idea, because it\u2019s not going to give you optimal levels.\n\nThe best is the sun \u2013 at least 30-45 min daily, during peak hours such as 10 am \u2013 2 pm when the sun is above. The sun also needs to be on big parts of your body \u2013 such as your legs and back.\n\nAnd getting enough daily sunlight, during peak hours, is not optimal for most people,\u2026 especially during the colder months and in different parts of the world.\n\nBut the rest of us, need to supplement with Vitamin D and also, vitamin K \u2013 because they both balance each other out and promote better calcium absorption into the bones, instead of the arteries.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ...

    "content": "How Vitamin D affects your hormones, specifically your testosterone levels?\n\nOne human clinical study showed that taking about 3500 units of Vitamin D daily, increased total testosterone levels by about 28% and free testosterone by about 23%\n\nMy suggestion for most people is to take about 5000 units (125 mcg) of D3 daily, with 50 mcg of Vitamin K2. Both should be taken together to support bone health and healthy calcium absorption.\n\nThe reason Vitamin D is so powerful is that it\u2019s not really a vitamin. It\u2019s technically a hormone, a steroid hormone in fact.\n\nUnfortunately, most of us are deficient in Vitamin D.\n\nAnd this is because you can primarily produce vitamin D from sunlight. This means going outside, for at least 30-45 minutes on a sunny day and making sure that big body parts get a lot of sunlight\u2026 such as the legs and back.\n\nThus, why most of us are deficient because we aren\u2019t getting enough daily sunlight\u2026 especially around the important peak hours of 10 am to 2 pm.\n\nTrust me when I tell you that you should for sure consider adding the correct dosage and type of D3 + K2 supplementation to your daily diet. Especially if you want a healthy boost in your total and free testosterone levels.\n\nThe combination of D3 + K2 is super powerful, healthy and very inexpensive.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

I figure, you\u2019re busy and nobody wants to read endless amounts of paragraphs. \u201cJust give me the facts and an action plan and I\u2019m on my way!\u201d.\n\nI Bet $1000.00 YOU\u2019RE Deficient In Vitamin D!\n\nHow can I make such a \u201cprediction\u201d?\n\nResearch shows that over 87% of the American population is deficient in vitamin D. And, close to 97% of African Americans or deeply pigmented individuals.\n\nAdd to it the fact that many people are scared of the sun because of skin cancer(total BS, read my Tanning Prevents Skin Cancer article), most people are indoors almost the entire day and you have a massive population of people who rarely get direct sunlight on their body.\n\n\u201cSo, What\u2019s The Big Deal?\u2026\u201d\n\nSimple, vitamin D deficiency has been CLEARLY linked to the following diseases and health conditions:\n\nOf course, lack of vitamin D isn\u2019t going to cause all the above problems for you. But if you do have one of the above \u201cissues\u201d, it\u2019s a good guarantee that your vitamin D deficiency is making it worse.\n\nIncreasing Vitamin D3, Can Save Over 1.2 Million Lives Yearly!\n\nThe newest research shows that simply increasing levels of vitamin D3, could prevent diseases that claim over 1.2 million lives, each and every year.\n\nIt\u2019s such an EASY and INEXPENSIVE solution, you\u2019d be crazy not to do something about it right now\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat Can You Do RIGHT Now?\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy, here\u2019s what I suggest:\n\nIF you can, try to get out in the sunlight every day. You can read my tanning article for specifics.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get some natural sunlight, you can try tanning beds. But, well\u2026 I\u2019m still not too hot on this idea, since most commercial brands aren\u2019t well maintained and people tend to overdo it and get burned.\n\nThe simplest solution is to just take oral vitamin D3 pills daily \u2013 that\u2019s what I do!\n\n\u201cHow Much Should I Take?\u201d\n\nMy very generalized answer for adults is to take 2000-5000 units daily, with food, but take the weekends OFF. And it\u2019s best to take it in the morning with your breakfast. So, every WEEKDAY, take a 2000-5000 unit pill (they are super small)with breakfast. Don\u2019t take any Saturday/Sunday.\n\nI use the 5000 unit version by Now Foods, 120 pills per bottle for about $8. It works out to about 6 cents a day. They\u2019re a good company, super cheap, and very convenient. You can get it anywhere online or at a local vitamin store.\n\nOf course, ideally, you would get blood tests to see where your current levels are and adjust your Vitamin D dosage accordingly. But I know most people won\u2019t do this(hassle, expense, etc.).\n\nBUT, if you do, your optimal level should be between 50-65 ng/ml.\n\nAlmost everything alive on this planet NEEDS the sun. Vitamin D is one of its many benefits. Close to 90% of people are deficient and it leads to dozens of common diseases.\n\nTry to get more sunlight when you can and take a Vitamin D3 supplement daily. Preferably 5000 units on weekdays, with the weekends off.\n\nFor about a nickel a day, you simply can\u2019t go wrong\u2026",
