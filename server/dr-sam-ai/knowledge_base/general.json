    "content": "This is more of an impromptu conversation about something important \u2014 loneliness in men.\n\nI\u2019m curious: do you feel lonely, either throughout the day or week? Has this increased in the past few years?\n\nSuicide in men is three times higher than in women, and loneliness may be one of the leading causes.\n\nWith the rise of the internet and smartphones, men are becoming more isolated \u2014 even though we\u2019re more \u201cconnected\u201d digitally.\n\nHow the Internet Changed Connection\n\nEven as far back as 1997, early research showed the internet was increasing feelings of isolation.\n\nFast forward to today, and people are more disconnected than ever.\n\nSocial interaction at gyms or with friends is being replaced by digital content creation and scrolling alone.\n\nThe Value of Male Bonding\n\nSome of the happiest times in life come from simple moments with close friends.\n\nEven ultra-wealthy people like Dan Bilzerian have stated that their most fulfilling times were just hanging out with buddies, not the yachts or in luxury.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Harder for Men to Connect\n\nAs men get older, friends move away, start families, or simply fade out of their lives.\n\nUnlike women, men often struggle to make new connections.\n\nEven asking another man to lunch can feel strange or uncomfortable \u2014 and that contributes to deeper isolation.\n\nThe Emotional Pressure on Men\n\nMen often avoid opening up because of fear of judgment or appearing weak.\n\nThis adds to emotional pressure.\n\nI\u2019ve known men who took their own lives \u2014 one of them being extremely close to me. It\u2019s heartbreaking and often tied to this lack of emotional outlet.\n\nChanging Social Behavior\n\nToday, everyone wears headphones, avoids eye contact, and focuses on themselves.\n\nEven in social spaces like gyms, it\u2019s rare to see real conversations.\n\nMost young men are also experiencing record-low sexual activity, largely due to a lack of social skills and confidence built through real-world interactions.\n\nWhy Communication Matters\n\nConstant texting instead of calling or meeting people in person has lowered emotional intelligence (EQ).\n\nMen especially need group interaction \u2014 we\u2019re wired for social bonding through shared activity. But many of us now feel awkward just talking to someone face to face.\n\nGetting Older & Growing Apart\n\nAs we age, many friendships drift due to time, distance, money, jealousy, or betrayal.\n\nEven working from home reduces the opportunity for organic social interactions. Many people feel alone, even in a room full of others \u2014 and this is common for introverts too.\n\nLet\u2019s have an honest conversation.\n\nDo you feel lonely? When do you feel the most alone?\n\nHow do you deal with it? Share your experiences.\n\nWhether it\u2019s around money, friendships, women, or just a general feeling of not being good enough, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nMaybe in the future, more men will open up \u2014 even if it\u2019s to something like ChatGPT.\n\nIt\u2019s not a replacement for human connection, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been struggling with feelings of loneliness, anxiety, insecurity, or thoughts of hopelessness \u2014 talk to someone. You matter.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "\u26a0\ufe0fThe Secret To Growing Taller In 2025",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/the-secret-to-growing-taller/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions from guys wanting to know IF or HOW you can grow taller.\n\nThe good news is that you CAN for sure get taller. I\u2019ve done it a few times with people, especially family members.\n\nHowever, the bad news is that what you\u2019ll discover today, obviously won\u2019t work for everyone, especially if you\u2019re over the age of 25.\n\nBut, even if you\u2019re over 25 and want to get taller, keep reading because there are certain things you can do that\u2019ll still make an improvement at any age.\n\nPlus at the end, I\u2019ll show you 2 simple ways that can make you instantly look 2-3 inches taller. Things I\u2019ve learned from some of my \u201cshorter\u201d friends.\n\nWhat Causes Tallness and Shortness\n\nSo the first question is, why are some people tall and some are short?\n\nMy dad is 6 feet tall. My oldest brother is 5\u201911\u201d. My second oldest brother is only 5\u20198\u201d while I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d and my mom is 5\u20194\u201d.\n\nIn my immediate family, it makes no sense.\n\nSo, picking the right parents isn\u2019t always a guarantee, unless BOTH of your parents are very tall.\n\nBut I\u2019ve always been tall, even before puberty.\n\nHowever, genetics will always play a primary role in everything, as do your hormone levels.\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t change your genetics, but you CAN improve your hormones and lifestyle, which can turn certain genetic factors on or off. This would be considered \u201cepigenetics\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t like to make things complicated or boring because there are lots of various hormones, enzymes, peptides, and so forth that all play a role in height. However, the main hormones are Thyroid, Estrogens and Growth Hormone, and IGF.\n\nSo, let me get right to it.\n\nIn boys, high estrogen levels accelerate the fusion of the bones and stop the growth plates from maturing.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard \u201cshort, fat, bald, and hairy\u201d to describe certain guys.\n\nWell, the \u201cshort and fat\u201d part is from high estrogen. The \u201cbald and hairy\u201d is from high DHT (dihydrotestosterone). And when both of these hormones are elevated, testosterone levels drop.\n\nSo that\u2019s 3 negatives!\n\nSo, the first goal is to have normal or low/normal levels of estrogen. Definitely NOT \u201chigh\u201d levels.\n\nSecondly, you want to have high Growth Hormone levels, which will cause your bones to continue to grow, as long as the ends haven\u2019t fused yet, typically due to estrogen and older age.\n\nLastly, you want optimal thyroid levels because your thyroid gland controls many other hormones and conversions. Optimal thyroid levels will help more Growth Hormone to convert to the more powerful IGF (insulin-like growth factor).\n\nUsing Drugs To Grow Taller\n\nSo, to achieve this optimal hormonal range using drugs, you would do a full hormone blood test to see where your levels are. Then, you would take an estrogen or aromatase inhibitor to lower, \u201chigh\u201d estrogen levels. But NOT an estrogen blocker.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to block estrogen. You want to lower the levels to a normal but lower level.\n\nYou would also take Growth Hormone at the same time, along with small amounts of T4 and T3 thyroid.\n\nThis is how it would be done with drugs. You would need a very smart, endocrinology doctor to assist you with all of this.\n\nI know this formula works. I\u2019ve seen it work a bunch of times.\n\nHowever, I am NOT telling you to do this at all and certainly NOT on your own. I\u2019m just letting you know what works: using pharmaceutical drugs and working with a very smart doctor.\n\nUnfortunately, this method won\u2019t be utilized by 99% of people.\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about how you can do it naturally.\n\nNatural Ways To Optimize Your \u201cHeight\u201d Hormones\n\nRemember, you can\u2019t change your genetics\u2026 but the correct lifestyle will maximize or minimize your genetic potential.\n\nThe first thing you must do is get quality, deep sleep every night. This is when the majority of your growth hormone is released.\n\nMost people, especially growing teenagers, don\u2019t sleep enough.\n\nYou must wake up on your own, NOT with an alarm clock.\n\nSleep also decreases stress hormones (such as cortisol), which is very important for growth \u2013 both muscle and bone.\n\nGet to bed early, around 9 or 9:30 and sleep till 6 am or longer. You must get a solid 8-9 hours of deep sleep.\n\nLook at a baby \u2013 it\u2019s sleeping all day and it\u2019s growing the most.\n\nI\u2019ll do an entire article about getting deep, optimal sleep because it\u2019s a super important topic for overall health.\n\nYou can take natural herbs to help your sleep better. I\u2019ve also got 3 popular \u201csleep-improving videos\u201d for more details.\n\nOn average, people are taller these days, than they were a few decades ago. One reason is that we\u2019re eating more food.\n\nBeing malnourished will for sure cause a decrease in growth.\n\nHowever, you must eat GOOD, healthy foods and NOT eat bad foods. Most people are eating junk, empty calories. Thus, even though they are eating more food, they are not getting enough nutrients \u2014 which is slowing your growth.\n\nThis means you need to eat a good amount of high-quality protein. Grass-fed beef and bison, pasture-raised chicken and whole eggs, wild-caught salmon, and similar foods.\n\nI would limit dairy because I don\u2019t like it and I think milk is for babies and cow milk is for baby cows. Maybe small amounts of yogurt.\n\nMake sure you stop eating junk protein like cold-cuts and pre-packaged foods and fast foods. They are horrible for your health and your growth.\n\nStay away from soy proteins because they increase estrogen and decrease thyroid production \u2014 both of which prevent you from reaching your maximum height. You can add in vegetable proteins as well if you\u2019d like.\n\nCarbohydrates are very important, especially for growth. You need insulin to grow. Insulin + thyroid + growth hormone = maximum IGF levels, which causes the most growth.\n\nMother\u2019s milk is primarily sugar and fat. So again, carbs are important.\n\nBut you must eat healthy carbohydrates such as vegetables, fruits, white rice, yams, and legumes.\n\nStay away from soda, packaged foods, chips, donuts, sugars, and white bread. They have NO nutritional value.\n\nBesides, high blood sugar and insulin levels will cause negative hormonal changes. You want healthy blood sugar levels, not low or high.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about fats, they are super important. Fats help produce so many important hormones needed for growth \u2013 muscle, brain, and bone.\n\nUnfortunately, most people either don\u2019t have enough fats or they eat junky, unhealthy fats.\n\nGood fats are whole eggs, and mono-unsaturated fats such as macadamia and olive oil. Coconut and MCT oil is good. Small amounts of grass-fed butter. Nuts are also good, especially walnuts and almonds. So are avocados, flaxseeds, and fish oils.\n\nStay away from the seed and so-called healthy vegetable fats such as canola, corn, sunflower, soybean, safflower, and similar oils. They cause inflammation and negative changes in your hormones.\n\nRead the labels and eat natural, healthy proteins, carbs, and fats.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and doing various drugs will not help you get taller and can decrease your potential for maximum height.\n\nI also suggest staying away from caffeine products such as energy drinks, coffee, soda, and so forth.\n\nStimulants like caffeine cause hormonal imbalances and stress your nervous system. Not to mention, they disrupt the most valuable formula for growth \u2013 DEEP SLEEP!\n\nExercise improves your hormones, which will help you get taller. And the less fat you are, the less estrogen your body produces and thus, the taller you can get.\n\nDo whatever you want when it comes to exercise.\n\nSwimming is really good. Lifting weights is fine too, especially if you do lots of pull-ups and bodyweight exercises. Go for higher reps, at least 10-15.\n\nBut, stay away from exercises that can compress your spine such as squats, deadlifts, overhead presses, and shrugs.\n\nTake Extra Supplements\n\nI also suggest taking extra vitamins and minerals. Calcium, magnesium, zinc, a good B-complex formula and vitamins C.\n\nOne of the most important vitamins for growth is Vitamin D3+K2.\n\nThis is because Vitamin D is actually a hormone, not a vitamin. And, most people are deficient in Vitamin D.\n\nFinally, don\u2019t forget about posture.\n\nStand up straight, chest out, shoulders back, and look straight. Don\u2019t look down and slumped forward.\n\nStand with confidence. You\u2019ll for sure LOOK a couple of inches taller.\n\nYou can also put \u201clifts\u201d inside your shoes and wear boots or dress shoes, which have heels.\n\nThe heel + the lift inside the shoes will easily add at least 2-3 inches to you.\n\nNow, some people will think, \u201cthat\u2019s cheating, you\u2019re being deceptive\u201d.\n\nBut women wear heels all the time to look taller, so who cares if you do as well? If it makes you feel better, then go for it.\n\nLastly, stop comparing yourself to others. If you\u2019re not as tall as you\u2019d like to be, that\u2019s fine. Nothing you can do about it.\n\nInstead, focus on all the great qualities you have, as well as the things that you CAN improve. Like staying in shape, having a great attitude, and being successful in something that you really care about.\n\nLife isn\u2019t fair. We all have things we like and dislike about ourselves. If you can make improvements, go for it. If you can\u2019t, then stop wasting valuable time and energy on it.",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about:\n\nDepression and how it\u2019s on the rise and affecting most people, especially younger people.\n\nHow light therapy can be just as effective or even better than SSRI anti-depressant drugs such as Prozac.\n\nMy personal interactions with depression, suicide, and light therapy.\n\nAnd finally, suggestions and action plans for you \u2026 if you too are also dealing with depression or sadness or feeling lonely or hopeless.\n\nEither way, just know that you\u2019re not alone and \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d.\n\nDepression is ON the rise\n\nThe CDC states that about 10% of adults over the age of 18 experience at least one major depressive episode a year\u2026 which is more than double just a decade ago.\n\nThe highest prevalence of depression is between the ages of 18-25, which is about 20%. That has more than doubled in the past decade.\n\nAdolescents between the ages of 12-17 are even higher, at almost 25%\u2026 with female adolescents being the highest at about 32% \u2026\n\nWe\u2019ve also had the highest suicide rates ever in recent history, which has increased by over 41% in the past decade.\n\nMales are almost 4x more likely to commit suicide. Especially white males.\n\nSadly, I can attest to this as I\u2019ve had 4 men in my life who have committed suicide. The most recent one was last year of someone I\u2019ve known my entire life. I won\u2019t get into the details, needless to say, losing my brother was and is still extremely painful.\n\nNow, this doesn\u2019t take into account the dramatic increase in feelings of anxiety, sadness, loneliness, and hopelessness.\n\nSo, what are the causes of all this?\u2026 Well, way too many to dig into today.\n\nInstead, today I want to focus on the solutions.\n\nThese days, more than ever, anti-depressants are being prescribed. SSRI\u2019s \u2026 sometimes, multiple ones.\n\nMany studies have shown that they are not so effective.\n\nAnd, studies have shown that they also increase the incidence of suicide.\n\nMy brother was one such person who was on multiple drugs, under the supervision of a psychiatrist\u2026 who didn\u2019t listen to me when I saw issues.\n\nLight Therapy Might Help\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying these drugs don\u2019t work. I\u2019m just saying natural options should first be utilized and one such option is light therapy.\n\nThere have been many studies showing that light therapy works as well or even better than drugs such as Fluoxetine, which is the brand name of Prozac.\n\nIn one 8-week study, Randomized, double-blind, placebo\u2026 full-spectrum light therapy was compared to fluoxetine/Prozac.\n\nOf the patients receiving the light therapy, 43.8% went into remission compared to 19.4% of the patients who were taking fluoxetine alone.\n\nNow, another study, showed there was not a significant difference between light vs Fluoxetine/Prozac. However, \u201cLight treatment showed earlier response onset and a lower rate of some adverse events\u201d\n\nThis means that light therapy works faster and in the end, it is just as effective.\n\nAnd in another study, 20 mg of Prozac vs bright light \u2013 which was 3000 LUX, for 2 hours daily\u2026\n\nThe results showed that \u201cThe remission rate in the bright light group tended to be superior (bright light 50%, fluoxetine 25%; P = 0.10)\u201d\n\nAdditionally, \u201cLight treatment in the morning produced a significantly faster onset of improvement\u201d\n\nThe bottom line here is that light treatment works, as well or even better than anti-depressant drugs such as Fluoxetine/Prozac.\n\nIt can work faster and of course, has no side effects.\n\nNor is light therapy addictive, unlike SSRI drugs.\n\nSome of you have probably heard Dr. Andrew Humberman talk about getting outside first thing in the morning and getting sunlight.\n\nNow, Andrew speaks about this in regards to improving your energy levels and allowing you to fall asleep better at night.\n\nWhich is definitely true.\n\nBut, we can now utilize this to ALSO improve our mood.\n\nThis means wake up, go outside, get some sunlight and take a walk for 10-20 minutes.\n\nThis alone will change your mood physiology and hormones.\n\nI do this every day and have many years. In the past few years, I\u2019ve had to do it because I have a dog. So, I never miss a day.\n\nThen, I put a light lamp on my desk while I\u2019m working.\n\nThis isn\u2019t as good as the sun, but it\u2019s still very good.\n\nYou want a light lamp with at least 3000 LUX. I use one of the highest at 10,000 LUX.\n\nLUX basically measures the brightness of light.\n\nFor example, direct sunlight is between 30K to 100K LUX\n\nOvercast daylight is between 1000-3000 LUX\n\nThe light lamp I have goes from 1000 to 10,000 LUX.\n\nI just leave it on the side of me on my desk while I\u2019m working. It\u2019s on for a few hours of the day.\n\nOf course, I turn it down to a lower LUX as the day proceeds and then off in the late afternoon, to tell my body to start getting ready for sleep.\n\nThis also means, later in the day, decrease the bright lights, especially before bed.\n\nWhy?\u2026 because it can impede the optimal production of dopamine and serotonin.\n\nThis is also why you want bright light early in the morning, to increase the positive, mood-improving neurotransmitters.\n\nSummary & Action Plan\n\nSo, light therapy will definitely help improve your mood \u2013 especially if you can\u2019t get outside or lack sunlight first thing in the morning.\n\nIf you want to give it a try, here is what I use. You can get something similar.\n\nThere are other proven methods for improving mood, exercise being extremely effective.\n\nAlso, take specific herbs and vitamins, which help support, boost, and optimize your positive, mood-improving neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine will also help.\n\nHerbs are powerful. They work quickly and they are easy and convenient. I know exercise isn\u2019t for most people.\n\nEither way, the very best thing you can do that will cost you nothing is to go outside first thing in the morning and go for a nice 10-20-minute walk.\n\nIf you\u2019re having one of those stressful days or you feel off or you need an extra boost in happy brain chemicals, you take ProVanax which contains natural herbs.\n\nLastly, if you feel suicidal, please get some help. Reach out to friends, therapy, or just someone to share your feelings.\n\nI do promise that \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d. A few days, weeks, and months from now, whatever\u2019s been troubling you, will not be nearly as bad.\n\nJust please don\u2019t give up on life or yourself.\n\nTRUST me, it will get better. Just take some positive action and let time heal.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/doctor-reveals-the-truth-about-vaping-illnesses-cancer-death/",
    "content": "One of the many perks of living in Southern California is that there\u2019s no smoking in 2025 and it\u2019s been going on for years, specific to many cities. It\u2019s banned, which means I don\u2019t have to smell it, let alone deal with the potential health risks.\n\nBut then a few years ago, people started using \u201chealthy\u201d forms of tobacco from e-cigarettes and now they\u2019re just called vaping.\n\nIn fact, I was originally asked around 2010 or so, to consult and be an investor in one of these companies. I refused because, at that time, I didn\u2019t think they were safe or good for people\u2019s health.\n\nI was assured they were very safe and was shown lots of clinical studies giving more proof.\n\nHowever, I still said no because I didn\u2019t believe it.\n\nThe bad news is that I lost millions of dollars because I didn\u2019t invest in the company.\n\nThe good news is that I still have my integrity.\n\nGranted, I will always have my integrity because I want to treat people the way I want to be treated. However, it would have been nice to keep my integrity AND make millions of dollars.\n\nSo, where am I going with this story?\u2026.\n\nSerious Health Problems\n\nAround 2015 I noticed a much higher use of vaping and even more so in the past couple of years.\n\nAnd because of this, we have a lot more user feedback and real-life effects from vaping and using e-cigarettes. Here are just some of the facts so far:\n\nPersonally, I believe one of the biggest issues is that vaping has now become an \u201cepidemic\u201d among teenagers, according to the FDA.1\n\nThere have been well over 180 vaping-related lung problems, according to the CDC.2 \u2026 and the numbers are growing quickly.\n\nFDA has stated that vaping can also cause seizures, with over 150 reports.3,4\n\nThere have also been numerous vaping-related problems.5-9\n\nLastly, these are still drugs and thus, also very addictive!\n\nKeep in mind that maybe e-cigs are probably safer than smoking regular cigarettes simply because they don\u2019t contain the thousands of additional chemicals found in regular cigarettes, known to cause serious health problems.\n\nHowever, they are by no means without risk or \u201csafe\u201d.\n\nSafer, but NOT safe at all.\n\nIn fact, so many of the vaping side effects were missed early on or simply ignored.\n\nThus, the point of today\u2019s information is that if you vape, you are now INFORMED that these products are horrible for your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nIf you want to keep doing them, that\u2019s your choice!\n\nWhat About Vaping & Marijuana\n\nToday\u2019s topic is mainly about vaping tobacco-containing products. However, the use of marijuana is on the rise because it\u2019s being legalized and thus, people are vaping it more.\n\nIs vaping marijuana safe for your health or lungs?\u2026 NO!\n\nCan you vape pot and not have negative effects in the short run and especially long-term?\u2026 NO!\n\nIf you\u2019d like more details about vaping and marijuana in a future article, let me know.\n\nAt the end of the day people, a drug is a drug. Use it often \u2013 and addiction will take over (whether physical or emotional) and long-term negatives will eventually kick in.\n\nThere\u2019s NO other way around it.\n\nSo either \u201cgive it up by not taking it up\u201d in the first place.\n\nOr, just do your best and use it occasionally.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-warns-juul-e-cigarettes-teen-vaping-epidemic/\n\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/vaping-hospitalized-with-lung-issues/#ftag=MSF491fea7\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-and-principal-deputy-commissioner-amy-abernethy-md-phd\n\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/fda-investigating-120-reports-of-possible-vaping-related-seizures/#ftag=MSF491fea7\n\nhttp://www.dph.illinois.gov/news/illinois-resident-experiencing-respiratory-illness-after-vaping-dies\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/health/vaping-death-lung.html\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/authorities-investigating-450-vaping-illnesses-and-a-third-death-11567794441\n\nhttps://kstp.com/medical/health-officials-confirm-first-minnesota-death-linked-to-vaping-mdh-lung-injuries/5482870/?cat=1\n\nhttps://abc7.com/health/first-vaping-associated-death-reported-in-la-county/5520786/",

    "content": "Recently, a conversation with my friend sparked an intriguing discussion about happiness.\n\nWhat is happiness, and how do we truly achieve it?\n\nThis conversation led me to some deep thinking about our constant pursuit of happiness and what it really means to live a fulfilled life.\n\nHappiness: Beyond the Temporary Highs\n\nWe often find joy in the small things \u2013 a delicious slice of pizza, a scoop of ice cream, or perhaps a fun night out.\n\nBut these moments of happiness are fleeting.\n\nIt got me thinking, that maybe chasing these temporary highs isn\u2019t what happiness is about.\n\nCould the real pursuit of happiness lie in the journey toward achieving our goals?\n\nThe Significance of Goals\n\nHaving goals gives us direction.\n\nIt\u2019s like setting sail towards a destination, with the journey itself bringing a sense of purpose and fulfillment.\n\nThis is particularly evident when observing the effects of retirement on men.\n\nOften, without work or goals, life seems to lose its vibrancy, which can lead to a decline in overall happiness and even health.\n\nWhen asked about goals, many might say they wish to earn more money.\n\nBut is that a true goal or just a fleeting desire?\n\nReal goals need to be specific and meaningful.\n\nThey should extend beyond just material gains, focusing on personal growth, health, and contributing to the well-being of others.\n\nThree Pillars Of Happiness\n\nHealth: Making health a priority is non-negotiable. Whether it\u2019s aiming to improve your cholesterol through diet and exercise or adopting a holistic approach to mental well-being, setting health-related goals is essential.\n\nRelationships: This includes nurturing connections with family, friends, and colleagues. Healthy relationships are a cornerstone of a happy life.\n\nFinances: While money isn\u2019t everything, financial stability enables us to live comfortably and pursue other goals that bring joy and satisfaction.\n\nFinding Joy in Progress\n\nThe key to happiness lies in making progress towards these meaningful goals.\n\nSeeing improvement, no matter how small fuels our joy and drives us to continue striving for better.\n\nHappiness \u2013 The Power of Giving\n\nTrue happiness often comes from beyond ourselves.\n\nHelping others, sharing knowledge, and making a positive impact in someone\u2019s life brings a deep sense of fulfillment that material possessions cannot match.\n\nMental Health and Well-being\n\nOn a personal note, the recent loss of my brother to suicide has deeply affected my views on happiness and mental health.\n\nIt\u2019s a stark reminder that success and wealth cannot shield us from inner turmoil.\n\nThis has reinforced my belief in the importance of prioritizing our mental and emotional health, along with physical well-being.\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear your perspectives.\n\nWhat brings you happiness?\n\nWhat goals are you working towards?\n\nHow do you find fulfillment in helping others?\n\nLet\u2019s make our health and happiness a priority, discussing and sharing ways to enhance our lives and those around us.\n\nI hope my reflections prompt you to think about your own path to happiness.\n\nIt\u2019s a journey, not a destination, and it\u2019s paved with goals that challenge us, relationships that support us, and actions that extend beyond our own needs.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/why-most-people-are-unhappy-comparison-theory/",
    "content": "I want to dive into something really important today \u2013 happiness.\n\nSpecifically, I want to talk about how comparing ourselves to others can steal our joy. It\u2019s a topic that\u2019s been on my mind for a while, and I think it\u2019s worth exploring.\n\nYou know, Teddy Roosevelt once said that \u201ccomparison is the thief of joy,\u201d and Mark Twain echoed a similar sentiment, calling the comparison \u201cthe death of joy.\u201d And they were onto something.\n\nWe all have a tendency to compare ourselves to others, but if you want to be truly happy, you\u2019ve got to break free from that cycle.\n\nI\u2019ve seen it time and time again \u2013 people who seem to have it all, but still aren\u2019t happy.\n\nThey make good money, but then they see their neighbor\u2019s new car and suddenly, they\u2019re not satisfied anymore.\n\nOr they\u2019re in a relationship, and they buy their partner something nice, but then they see someone else with something even better, and they want more.\n\nMy Personal Experience\u2026\n\nI have a friend who\u2019s done really well in business. He started with a Lamborghini, and then he upgraded to a more expensive one, and then another, and another.\n\nHe\u2019s still not happy.\n\nBecause he\u2019s constantly comparing himself to others, always wanting more.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just about material things.\n\nI see it in the gym too.\n\nWhen I first started working out, I\u2019d look at other guys and wonder why I wasn\u2019t as big or as strong as them. It took me a year just to bench press 135 pounds, while my friend was hitting the 300-pound club. I felt good about my progress, but then I\u2019d see him and feel like I wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nThe Enemy Of Happiness\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2013 comparison is the enemy of happiness.\n\nIt drains you of joy and motivation, and it prevents you from appreciating what you have.\n\nSo instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own progress. As long as you\u2019re moving forward, that\u2019s all that matters.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy.\n\nWith social media, it\u2019s harder than ever to avoid comparing ourselves to others.\n\nBut remember, you never know the full story behind someone\u2019s posts. That friend who seems to have it all might be miserable on the inside.\n\nSo here\u2019s my challenge to you \u2013 stop comparing yourself to others.\n\nInstead, focus on your own journey and celebrate your progress, no matter how small.\n\nAnd remember, happiness isn\u2019t about reaching some arbitrary goal \u2013 it\u2019s about finding contentment in the present moment.\n\nI hope this message resonates with you. If it does, share it with someone who needs to hear it.\n\nAnd remember to be kind to yourself and those around you. Positivity breeds positivity, so let\u2019s spread some joy today.\n\nThanks for reading, and here\u2019s to a happy and healthy day.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/sexual-health/how-big-is-the-average-penis-size/",
    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is \u201cHow big is the average penis size\u201d?\n\nBefore I start, a while back I did a video about how to grow your penis. It came with an entirely free course on everything you need to know about having a larger, better-performing penis\u2026 at any age.\n\nSince that video, I\u2019ve gotten hundreds of questions from guys about the penis\u2026 most of them in private messages and emails.\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a topic I want to keep talking about, since I think there are much bigger health concerns than penis size.\n\nHowever, this blog is about YOU and if so many guys keep asking about \u201cpenis topics\u201d, then I\u2019m going to do my best to help you and give you more clarity and hopefully, a lot more confidence at the end of it all.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, I think guys care way more about their penis than women do.\n\nSo, today\u2019s topic is going to be about the average penis size and the newest research for 2025.\n\nFor future videos, I\u2019ll also discuss other \u201cpenis\u201d related topics such as:\n\nDoes size really matter to women, what does the research say?\n\nHow to accurately measure your penis.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important, length or width?\n\nWhat do women REALLY want? (based on anonymous surveys, so you\u2019ll get the REAL answers, not politically correct ones)\n\nAnd finally, can you really grow your penis, and if yes, by how much (based on REAL world results).\n\nOkay, so let\u2019s get started\u2026\n\nBased on a 2020 review of research on penis size, the results showed that the average erect penis is between 5.1 \u2013 5.5 inches. If measuring in centimeters, that is between 13-14 cm.\n\nBefore I dig deeper into the research and discuss other interesting numbers and facts\u2026\n\nIf you think about it, 5 \u2013 5.5 inches isn\u2019t super big.\n\nYet, if you ask most guys what the average penis length is, they\u2019ll say is about 6 or 6.5 inches. As you can see, this is way off.\n\nSo, 5 to 5.5 inches is certainly not what you see in porn or what guys typically brag about.\n\nOr what women will say about some \u201cbig\u201d guy she\u2019s been with in the past since they don\u2019t know how to measure anything.\n\nHeck, I remember a couple of women I had dated, telling me their previous boyfriend was like 10 inches. I\u2019d think to myself, \u201cWhat the hell\u2026 that\u2019s huge\u201d and I\u2019d feel self-conscious.\n\nBut later on, I realized that women don\u2019t know how to measure and they overestimate by a lot. So, keep that in mind.\n\nAnd that\u2019s one major problem with all of this \u2013 most people compare their penis to what they see in porn.\n\nYou need to remember, the guys in porn, especially these days, are the \u201cbest of the best\u201d. These guys are naturally larger than the average. With some of them being way larger.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve known and consulted porn guys in the past.\n\nThey got into the business and were given the opportunity because of their genetically \u201cwell-endowed\u201d larger penis. No other reason.\n\nIt\u2019s like working out. No matter how much you lift weights, how much you eat, or many steroids you take, you\u2019ll never be as big as professional bodybuilders. Not even from 50 years ago like Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nRemember \u2013 You can always improve. You can get bigger.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t have the genetics, you\u2019ll never be \u201csuper big\u201d. Not in bodybuilding and have 20-inch arms. Nor with your penis and have 8-10 inches.\n\nSome Interesting Numbers\n\nSo\u2026 let\u2019s continue with the rest of the research and some of the interesting numbers.\n\nWhen it comes to girth, the average is 3.66 inches (9.3 cm) for a flaccid penis and 4.59 inches (11.7 cm) for an erect penis.\n\nAround 85 percent of people with penises overestimate what the average penis size actually is.\n\nMany people with penises are under the impression that the average package is over 6 inches long \u2014 a notion that researchers partially attribute to studies that were based on self-reported measurements\u2026 Basically, people either lied or didn\u2019t measure correctly.\n\nBased on various reports, 45 percent of people with penises wish they had a larger penis, including those who have average-sized ones.\n\nFor some perspective, an erect penis of 6.3 inches (16 cm) falls into the 95 percentile, meaning that only 5 out of 100 people would have a penis longer than 6.3 inches.\n\nLikewise, an erect penis of 3.94 inches is in the 5 percentile, meaning that only 5 out of 100 would have a penis shorter than 3.94 inches.\n\nAround 95 percent of penises do fall into the average range\n\nSo to recap, research says the average penis size is a lot smaller than what most people believe it is and usually looks nothing like what you see in porn.\n\nIf you\u2019re between 5 to 5.5 inches, you\u2019re average. You\u2019re like everyone else.\n\nNow, if you are smaller and want a larger penis. Or, if you are average and want an \u201cabove\u201d average penis size, then I\u2019ve got a video for you to watch, as well as a free email course on everything you need to know and do to have a bigger, fuller, healthier, and better-performing penis.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0092623X.2020.1787279\n\nhttps://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bju.13010\n\nhttps://go.skimresources.com/?id=41977X1601025&isjs=1&jv=15.3.0-stackpath\n\nhttps://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bju.13010\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/318023027_A_Structured_Review_and_Critical_Analysis_of_Male_Perceptions_of_the_Penis_A_Comparison_between_Heterosexual_Men_and_Men_Who_Have_Sex_with_Men_MSM\n\nhttps://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-09081-001",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness/my-personal-experience-with-cbd-oil/",
    "content": "As you may know or have seen lately, the topic of CBD oil is becoming very popular. In fact, marijuana is a hot topic this past couple of years because it\u2019s been legalized in a few states.\n\nI see AND smell people smoking and vaping pot a lot these days because I live in Los Angeles and it\u2019s legal here. Plus, living close to Venice Beach, it\u2019s just part of the culture.\n\nIn just the past year or two, it seems that everyone is selling CBD oil because it has so many *potential* health claims.\n\nBut, this is true with anything new. Lots of over-the-top health claims, never any negative side effects, and then as more and more people use it over time, the feedback starts to build up and the REAL results come in.\n\nAnyway, I bring up all of this because I\u2019ve had a lot of people asking me about my personal thoughts on CBD and CBD oil.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll discuss today.\n\nMy Personal Background With Drugs\n\nFirst, I\u2019ve never smoked anything. Simply because at age 14, I had asthma and even when I tried to be \u201ccool\u201d and smoke cigarettes or marijuana, I couldn\u2019t.\n\nAt that same time, I got into working out at that same age and I wanted to be healthy, eat right, take supplements, and so forth \u2013 so, I just never got into drugs. I didn\u2019t want to take anything that would have a negative effect on my body and my health goals.\n\nNow, I have no issue or judgment with anyone doing drugs except for 3 important criteria:\n\nDon\u2019t do it, if it\u2019s going to hurt other people. This means, don\u2019t get high or drunk and then go driving or do something stupid, which could harm someone else.\n\nDon\u2019t do it if you can\u2019t afford it and have other responsibilities \u2013 like family, kids, and so forth. Grow up and get your priorities straight.\n\nDon\u2019t throw up near me or in my car!\n\nAnd I mention all of this because after all is said and done and all the years of me saying \u201cno to drugs\u201d and not having any desire, the past year I decided to give CBD oil a try.\n\nI\u2019ve had 3 major CBD companies ask me to be on their board of advisors and as a medical advisor. But, I declined all of them because I have no experience with it and thus, I\u2019m not going to lie or deceive people.\n\nHowever, I did want to see what all the hype is about.\n\nPeople have listed many benefits, such as:\n\nPain relief and healthy inflammatory response\n\nReducing anxiety & depression\n\nAlleviating cancer-related symptoms\n\nFor me, I wanted to give it a try for the sleeping properties.\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated in the past, I\u2019ve NEVER been a good sleeper. Even as a child. I\u2019m a super light sleeper. My brain is always on and I\u2019m thinking about things.\n\nMy Favorite Sleep Formula\n\nSo for years, my favorite sleep formula was:\n\nAnd 3-4 pills of ProVanax \u2013 which helps you relax, improve your mood, increase serotonin, GABA, and has lots of other emotional health benefits.\n\nWhat I like about the mixture of these 3 supplements is that I sleep well and most importantly, I wake up energized and NOT tired or groggy, unlike most sleeping products, pills, and drugs.\n\nBut I don\u2019t do this every night. I do it about 4-5x a week. Like, 2 on and 1 off to prevent my body from adapting and the effects stop working.\n\nSo, I had a couple of friends tell me to use CBD oil to help me sleep and that\u2019s what I did.\n\nThe stuff was expensive since I got the really good stuff.\n\nI took the recommended dose, waited an hour, and felt nothing. Then I took the same dose again and felt nothing. Tripled the dose and still, I felt nothing.\n\nI gave up and took my magnesium, melatonin, and ProVanax combo and finally fell asleep.\n\nBut I tried CBD oil again the next night at a much higher dose. Still nothing. I then took 10x the dose and I finally felt more relaxed and tired. But, I did wake up slow and sluggish in the morning.\n\nTest CBD Oil Yourself\n\nSo for me, it didn\u2019t work. I experimented with different doses and I got a good brand that others liked and swore by.\n\nHowever, it may work for you.\n\nAs with everything, you need to test it out on YOU.\n\nFor example, some people say they get amazing pain relief and others say, they feel nothing.\n\nOf course, there are also placebo effects.\n\nHowever, the bottom line is IF you feel better, then take it. If you don\u2019t, then stop.\n\nThe good thing about CBD oil is that it doesn\u2019t have many negative effects.1 The most common are\n\nStomach problems, such as diarrhea\n\nIncrease in appetite and weight gain\n\nFatigue and just feeling slower and more tired\n\nSo, it\u2019s worth giving it a test drive and seeing what benefits you may get out of it since the negatives are very minor.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/",

    "content": "So today, I\u2019m going to talk about a topic that I never thought I\u2019d talk about and that\u2019s how you can get shorter and decrease your height. Is it even possible and why would someone want to do this?\n\nThe irony is I did an article about \u201cthe secret to getting taller\u201d and that\u2019s well-received.\n\nWhich makes sense. Most people, especially guys, want to get taller.\n\nSo, why have I gotten dozens of questions about how to get shorter?\n\nBut, this blog is for YOU, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to talk about today.\n\nReason to Get Shorter\n\nNow, if you\u2019re a tall woman, I can for sure understand why you would want to get shorter.\n\nWomen want their guys to be taller than them. In fact, statistics show that only about 1% of women marry a person shorter than them.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re super tall\u2026 like over 6 feet or 6\u20195\u2019\u2019, women, you have lower odds of finding a guy that\u2019s taller than you and that you also are attracted to \u2013 physically and emotionally.\n\nSo, you\u2019ll end up \u201csettling\u201d for someone shorter.\n\nNow comes the big question, can you get shorter?\n\nWell, the truth is that we all shrink in size as we get older. But, who cares what your height is when you\u2019re 65, right?\u2026\n\nUnfortunately, the answer is NO, you can\u2019t get shorter. You can\u2019t decrease your height.\n\nHowever, there are things you can do, to not appear as tall and certainly, not taller than you are.\n\nThe first is you must wear flats.\n\nLadies, no high heels.\n\nLook at the popular show, the Big Bang Theory.\n\nThe female actress, Kaley Cuoco, who plays Penny is almost always wearing flat shoes on the show.\n\nOr she\u2019s barefoot or wearing flip-flops.\n\nThis isn\u2019t by accident. This is because she\u2019s 5\u20196\u201d while her co-star and boyfriend on the show, Johnny Galecki who plays Leonard, is 5\u20195\u201d.\n\nShe\u2019s an inch taller than him.\n\nThus, they don\u2019t bring attention to the height issue by her wearing high heels.\n\nThis is the same with Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man.\n\nWhen they are together, she is barefoot.\n\nThis is because they are both the same height, 5\u20199\u201d\n\nSecondly, don\u2019t wear your hair up to give you extra height.\n\nThis is a great tactic if you\u2019re short, but not if you want to not look as tall.\n\nLastly, since there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, stop thinking about it. Stop seeing it as a negative. Stop wasting valuable time worrying about it.\n\nI always tell people, to spend their time and energy on things they CAN control \u2013 not other people, the past, or the future.",

    "content": "On the surface, both drugs are similar in the sense that they both treat patients who have a dependency on opioids or certain drug additions. Interestingly enough, both suboxone and methadone are opioid drugs as well. Suboxone is known as a partial opiate agonist or one that has limited effects even when taken in larger doses. Methadone however is a full opiate which means that the more you take, the greater the effects will be.\n\nThe history of methadone does back to 1947 when it was first introduced to the public. Methadone was the standard for treatment until the emergence of suboxone in 2002. Up until that point, the issues with methadone in terms of addiction were very well known and there were searches for alternatives that provided the same effectiveness as methadone without the addictive aspects. Suboxone arguably is that alternative, although it is also not totally free of addictive qualities.\n\nSimilarities and Differences\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between the drugs is that suboxone is far harder to abuse than methadone. This is one reason why suboxone is a drug that is often prescribed over methadone in that it reduces the chances of addiction to another drug. Methadone can be abused rather readily which is why in many cases the drug itself is not prescribed for the patient to take home, but rather to go to the clinic or hospital to take there instead. After a time if no addictive effects are reported, then the methadone is allowed to be prescribed for home use.\n\nHowever, while suboxone is less addictive in nature than methadone, it is also less effective against people who have a serious addiction. Those with heavy opiate habits already are hard pressed to have suboxone have any real effect on them. Methadone is far better at reaching them thanks to its inherent strength, but that also runs the danger of becoming addicted to methadone as well.\n\nSuboxone does excel in the fact that the withdrawal symptoms during the detox period are far less than methadone which makes it more suitable for patients who are not looking forward to that part of their treatment. However, the biggest advantage that suboxone offers is that the risk of a fatal overdose is far less than methadone which does make it safer to use as an at-home prescription.\n\nMethadone however may be more effective than suboxone in what it is trying to accomplish, but its qualities are such that it can also be quite dangerous when abused. Interestingly enough, methadone is cheaper than suboxone and generics are available as well which makes it even more affordable.\n\nOverall, suboxone is the drug preferred because it does have far fewer addicting qualities and is much harder to abuse that methadone. However, for the hard-core drug user suboxone just may not be enough and they may be forced to use methadone instead from their doctor\u2019s office. The bottom line is that you will need to talk to your doctor about which one may work best for your needs.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Antidepressants are a common medication that is prescribed for those who are suffering from the effects of depression. They may be particularly useful in treated moderate to severe cases of depression where life is dramatically impacted in a negative way without medication. Most doctors will go over the pros and cons of a antidepressant prescription during the treatment process, but there are some advantages and disadvantages you may not have known about with this medication.\n\nWhat Are the Pros of Antidepressants?\n\n1. All Antidepressants Are Equally Effective There is no evidence to say that one brand of antidepressants is better than another brand. People may react differently to different antidepressants, however, which is why one may be recommended over another. If one antidepressant causes weight gain and the other does not, that\u2019s an important reason to take one over the other.\n\n2. It Is An Incredibly Cost-Effective Treatment Option Generic versions of some antidepressants can be obtained for about $1 per day. For those who are on tight budget or may not have access to comprehensive prescription drug insurance, it allows for effective treatment options to be received without too much budgetary damage.\n\n3. They Can Create Better Intimate Experiences For men who struggle in the intimacy department, especially when length of time is being considered, antidepressants can prolong how long guys are able to last.\n\n4. They May Help to Relieve Fibromyalgia Symptoms One of the unique features about the older antidepressants that are on the market today is that they have certain anti-inflammatory qualities to them. It allows people to go through the day with less pain, sleep better at night, and still be able to retain a positive mood. Two out of the three drugs approved for American use in the treatment of fibromyalgia are antidepressants.\n\nWhat Are the Cons of Antidepressants?\n\n1. It Could Completely Eliminate Sexual Desire Some people, but mostly guys, have found that antidepressants have caused a permanent decrease in their overall libido. Other issues, including sensitivity and even total dysfunction have also been noted. The assumption is that these problems resolve themselves after the antidepressants are no longer taken, but that hasn\u2019t always been the case.\n\n2. It Could Affect Fertility Men who have taken antidepressants and were completely healthy were found to have fragmented DNA within their sperm in just 4 weeks. Fertility issues did resolve themselves in about a month after stopping the antidepressants, but the issue could make it difficult for a couple to become pregnant.\n\n3. It Could Affect Overall Bone Density Although no studies have definitely confirmed this, there is the potential for higher levels of bone fractures, particularly hip fractures, in those who are regularly taking antidepressants.\n\nAntidepressants have shown to be helpful in a number of circumstances, but there are some disadvantages that should be considered as well. By evaluating all of the pros and cons of what antidepressants can do, everyone can make the right choice about taking them during a conversation with their doctor.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "Pristiq is an antidepressant that has gotten a great deal of attention recently thanks to the large advertising campaign for this product. This particular drug is one that is prescribed for people who have depression and the marketing push indicates that the drug itself works on both norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitters which put it into a unique class of drug. Prozac for example only works on the serotonin aspect, so Pristiq seems to be a far more comprehensive approach.\n\nHowever, the same company that produces Pristiq also makes Effexor which is virtually the same type of drug. Effexor has recently become available as a generic which also makes it more affordable, so what are the similarities and differences between these two drugs?\n\nSimilarities and Differences\n\nIt certainly seems at first that the similarities are such that any differences would be very minor indeed. Because they both come from the same chemical compound, a person who takes Effexor will actually have their body break down the product into Pristiq along with some other chemicals. So in practical terms if you take Effexor, it will become Pristiq in the body at some point.\n\nSo, if they are both essentially the same, then why do they both exist? Perhaps because the patent on Pristiq is running out and creating Effexor is a way for a company to extend the patent itself and probably keep their profit margins up. However, there are some differences that exist between the drugs as well.\n\nJust because both will metabolize in roughly the same way does not mean that they are identical in nature. This is because Effexor has other chemicals attached that the body will absorb as well which creates a different effect. However, the extra chemicals of Effexor mean that Pristiq actually has fewer known side effects in general because it contains fewer compounds. For those who might have a reaction to Effexor, Pristiq may be a better alternative.\n\nIn fact, Effexor has been known to generate more side effects in those who take the product than those who use Pristiq instead. The extra compounds in Effexor are the main difference and they are a substantial one for those who are suffering. If you are currently taking Pristiq and it is working, then there is no real reason to switch to Effexor unless you can save a considerable amount of money. However, the opposite is true as well for those who are taking Effexor if they are not suffering any side effects and can save money as well, then taking Pristiq is really not a viable option.\n\nOverall, it might be said that the differences are so slight that choosing one over the other may not make much of a difference. So, you might go with Effexor first if only because it is less expensive in its generic form. If you suffer from unwanted side effects, then switching to Pristiq may be the answer. Otherwise, the differences between the two drugs are very slight as your body does break both down in a very similar fashion.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "The genes in your body are part of the blueprint for your size, health and physical condition. While everyone has a few defective genes in their body, most people are not aware of them until they start causing a genetic disease.\n\nPreventing this type of disease from occurring is rather difficult unless the gene itself can be directly treated. Gene therapy is a relatively recent type of treatment that goes after the very genes which can cause many serious, hereditary diseases from occurring.\n\nWhat is Gene Therapy?\n\nGenes are the basic unit of heredity and include base sequences that create instructions for the production of proteins in the body. The proteins will perform many of the life functions and help form the cellular structures as well. If a gene is altered in some fashion so that it does not properly encode the proteins, then they will malfunction and a genetic disorder may result.\n\nGene therapy is the technique used to correct these mutated genes so that they will function correctly and then get rid of the root cause of the disease. Over the past few years there have been a number of breakthroughs which have resulted in a number of new treatments.\n\nWhat Are the Pros of Gene Therapy?\n\nThe most obvious positive of gene therapy is that when it is successful, the genetic disease which has been afflicting the body can now be more easily eradicated since it is no longer being produced. In addition, the therapy can prevent the mutated genes from being passed on to the next generation which means that many hereditary diseases can be stopped in their tracks long before they can begin.\n\nFor many, the benefits outweigh any risk any of the potential complications as there are few at least in terms of physical effects. When done correctly, gene therapy has no side effects as only the defective gene is addressed.\n\nWhat Are the Cons of Gene Therapy?\n\nCurrently, the development of gene therapy is still in the early stages so there is techniques that still being tried to perfect the approach. However, given the number of advances that have happened in recent years, it seems likely that such techniques will be perfected soon before they are used on the general public.\n\nHowever, despite the relative lack of medical side effects when gene therapy is performed correctly, there are other matters that many people have questions about before it is put into full effect.\n\nThere is the ethical question of whether genes that are not defective can be changed by this type of therapy. If so, then can scientist create a super race through this form of therapy? While this is currently not the goal of most scientists, it cannot be ruled out that some may go beyond proper ethics and morals to create a race of humans that fit their particular vision.\n\nIn the long run, if the proper controls are used then gene therapy will have a profound effect on the health of millions of people as defective genes are removed from the population and not passed down to their children.",

    "content": "One of the most exciting developments in the medical field is the advancement of genetic testing. Before the advent of this form of testing, the only way to predict hereditary diseases was by family history which could be erratic since sometimes the diseases or conditions skip generations. However, the mapping of the genome combined with the identification of defective genes has allowed doctors access to vital information that makes predicting the development of a genetic condition much more viable\n\nThe Pros of Genetic Testing\n\nThere are a number of benefits to the use of genetic testing which has led to many thousands of people lowering and even avoiding their risk of contracting certain types of diseases.\n\nLower Risk of Contracting Diseases: The main benefit of this form of testing is that doctors can now combine different information to make predictions of what might develop in your body and subsequently take preventative action. This is especially true of cancer which is often caused by abnormal genes which starts the progress of the disease.\n\nGreater Focus on Prevention: For those who are genetically tested at an early age, risks that might develop in their later years can be predicted on a more accurate basis so that a person can come back for more frequent examinations. In the case of breast cancer for example , mammograms can be held more frequently to spot the disease in its early stages when it is nearly 100% curable.\n\nPreventative Measures: In some cases, preventative action can be taken to dramatically lower the chances of developing certain diseases. The removal of breast tissue and the ovaries for example can help greatly lower the risk of developing these particular forms of cancer.\n\nThe Cons of Genetic Testing\n\nDespite the great strides that genetic testing has brought to the medical profession, it is not a \u201ccure-all\u201d for those who may suffer from disease in the future.\n\nIndecision About Taking Action: Arguably the biggest downside is that while identifying potential illnesses and diseases is now easier, the difficult part is selecting which action should be taken. From taking medications to the removal of the tissue, the effectiveness of the preventative actions is such that it does not mean that the disease will not occur.\n\nLower, but Not Eliminate Risk: The removal of the breasts for example does not actually prevent the development of breast cancer because there are still breast cells that remain. So, while the chances of developing certain forms of cancer are greatly lowered, they are not 100% preventable just because most of the tissue is removed.\n\nOverlook Abnormal Genes: A test result that comes back indicating all healthy genes does not mean that the chances for developing diseases are gone. In fact, there are many cases of breast cancer that occurred in patients who had repeatedly come back with clean genetic testing results.\n\nEssentially, this means that the genetic testing process is really still in its early stages and is not the final word in prevention. However, it does offer another tool that can be used in the prevention of certain diseases and particularly cancers from forming.",

Not only are the names rather unfamiliar and similar in certain respects, but they are both brands of inhalers which have no generic equivalent to them. This means that for those with asthma and some who have COPD, each of these inhalers have different attributes as well as their own set of side effects. You can wind up paying different prices as well for the products depending in large part on what your doctor wants to prescribe.\n\nAlbuterol HFA inhalers will have brand names such as ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA and Ventolin HFA while Xopenex HFA is the same as levalbuterol HFA. The Albuterol HFA inhalers have a basic strength of 108mcg/actuation while the Xopenex has about 45mcg/actuation, so the Albuterol is stronger.\n\nSimilarities and Differences\n\nBoth brands are considered rescue inhalers that are designed to be fast-acting and used to correct a short term breathing issue that is usually brought upon by an asthma attack. Both types will help open up airwaves and help improve the breathing for individuals who suffer from asthma or similar conditions.\n\nOne advantage of Xopenex is that it generally has fewer side effects than Albuterol thanks in part to its lower dosage and other attributes. Albuterol may increase the heart rate, so patients who have heart issues, high blood pressure or coronary artery disease will need to be cautious when using the product.\n\nThe price comparison is fairly similar between both brands you can find each of them between $50 to $70 depending on where you shop. When breaking down each brand of inhaler shows off some minor differences, there are plenty of variables when it comes to which one to purchase. While Ventolin HFA is arguably the cheapest, it is not by much and the price itself will depend on the retailer and the prescription that your doctor authorizes for you condition.\n\nIt is interesting comparing both Xopenex vs. Albuterol as each of them have their own attributes and side effects. Choosing between them can be difficult because there are so many unknown factors which are based on the physiology of the patient and the unique types of side effects that may result. Both are safe to use and offer benefits in terms of effectiveness as a rescue inhaler. However, there is relatively little difference in price that may make choosing between them more difficult.\n\nOverall, the differences between the brands come down to the strength of the product, the price you can find it at and the side effects that come with each type. In any case, you should consult with your doctor when it comes to the brand that works best for your needs. You may be able to try both brands in order to see which one works best for your needs. However, keep in mind that if you have a heart condition, Xopenex is arguably better because it has fewer side effects and may be the safer choice.",

    "title": "Juvederm Versus Restylane | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health-se/juvederm-versus-restylane/",
    "content": "When considering a lift, there are two basic injections that are often considered: Juvederm and Restylane. Fillers are a non-invasive treatment to correct certain conditions when someone wished to avoid surgery. These two products are remarkably the same, which makes choosing between them a little difficult for some people.\n\nHere\u2019s why there is such difficulty. Both are manufactured in Europe. They both are fillers that are based on hyaluronic acid. Both are often offered by a treatment provider for use around the lips and for fine lines and wrinkles. Juvederm and Restylane even have similar side effects, such as over-augmentation and lumps that can form. Because they are both made from hyaluronic acid, the results of both products can be neutralized with one injection of a counteragent.\n\nWith so many similarities between the two products, how can the debate of Juvederm vs. Restylane be resolved? Here are the factors to consider if you\u2019re thinking about choosing one product over the other.\n\n1. How Easy Is It To Inject The Product?\n\nIn this instance, Juvederm has a slight edge over Restylane. The filler is just a little smoother and injects a little easier. This makes Juvederm easier to manipulate when it comes to difficult injection sites like the eyelids. It also provides an advantage when working with extremely fine lines that must be altered in order to receive a consistent aesthetic appearance.\n\nIt is important to ask who will be making the injections. Many providers will delegate this task away from the cosmetic surgeon and this is something that you do not want. The person who will be injecting the filler should be Board Certified. If they are not, then you will want to find a different treatment provider for either product.\n\n2. What About Deeper Wrinkles And Lines?\n\nRestylane has an advantage when it comes to deeper lines and wrinkles that need correction. While Juvederm tends to disperse immediately into the tissues, Restylane stays more cohesive and will congregate around the injection point. This requires the provider to using molding techniques with the filler to create the desired results. That cohesiveness, when properly applied, helps to smooth out the deeper wrinkles and lines that form more effectively.\n\nMany providers typically recommend Restylane when there are hollow areas underneath the eyes as well. The problem with this type of application, however, is that lumps may form easily with an inexperienced injector and must be actively sculpted to prevent a problematic appearance.\n\n3. How Long Can The Products Endure?\n\nWhen comparing the length of time the fillers maintain their appearance, Restylane has a slight edge over Juvederm. This is because of its overall cohesiveness. Juvederm remains active for about the same length of time, around 12 months, but because it disperses, the lift results tend to flatten out more in Juvederm when compared to Restylane.\n\n4. What About Concentration Levels?\n\nJuvederm has a higher concentration of hyaluronic acid when compared to Restylane, which may be beneficial for some patients. Both products have a similar cost, however, and both tend to use a full syringe of filler for the application points in question. Because the filler is less cohesive, however, Juvederm tends to settle after being injected and although this creates less of a risk for lumps, it also creates less of a lift effect in some patients.\n\nWhich Product Is Right For You?\n\nIt is important to consider treatment provider bias when evaluating the differences between Juvederm and Restylane. Both manufacturers offer treatment providers incentives for selling their products to patients. This may create a local bias towards one product over the other because a sales quota may need to be met. With enough filler sold, treatment providers may receive product discounts and other referral advantages.\n\nThe one disadvantage is that Restylane has a higher risk of forming lumps than Juvederm. In reality, this tends to be dependent on the skills of the injector. A highly experienced treatment provider will create the lift a patient wants without lumps, but problems are easily corrected with a neutralizing injection.\n\nBoth products, however, create similar results for a similar price. It\u2019s a lot like trying to choose between your favorite brand names of cola. It all depends on personal preference and what need must be met. Restylane is slightly more cohesive, so it can fill in areas a little better. That really is the main difference between the two products. You an receive good results with either product.",

When shopping for a premium bicycle, you will find that many come equipped with the Ultegra or Shimano 105 components, but not both.\n\nThe first thing to note about the differences between the Shimano 105 and the Ultegra is that Shimano updates their components every four years. In 2015, the 105 is going to be updated, while the Ultegra was updated in 2014. Each cycle has better components than the previous one, so 2014 Ultegra components are going to be better than the 2011 105 components.\n\nWhat Is the Benefit of Using Ultegra Components?\n\nFor those who plan to use their bicycle for racing, Ultegra components tend to be the best option. This is because they are lighter than the 105 components, so it is easier to achieve a maximum speed. The lighter components also make it easier to use the bike for climbing. The weight difference isn\u2019t much. When directly compared, a full Ultegra group set will weigh about 0.5 pounds less than the 105 group.\n\nUltegra components also have less flexibility than their 105 counterparts, giving the bicycle a stiffer feeling. This provides a certain sturdiness for users who have hard pedaling needs while on the bicycle. This prevents energy waste and allows for a better energy flow for consistent speeds.\n\nUltegra also benefits from a wider crankset design, while allows the frame of the bicycle to be outfitted with wider brackets on the bottom. This adds another level of stiffness to the frame that prevents energy loss through flexibility as well. The range of gears is better in the high and low range when compared to the 105 as well, making it easier to maintain speeds while climbing or descending a graded path.\n\nFor those who are training to race competitively, whether in a triathalon or over a long-distance road coarse, the Ultegra groupset provides many of the options of the Dura-Ace groupset, but without the same price. Shifting and braking are especially smooth and it is very easy to just focus on the ride when this is equipped to the bike.\n\nWhat Is the Benefit of the Shimano 105?\n\nOn most bicycles, the Shimano 105 gruppo is going to be cheaper than the Ultegra components. It may be a little heavier, but it is highly suited to those who need a bike for casual riding instead of racing. Although Ultegra components tend to keep their resale value better, recreational riders tend to prefer the 105 because of the lower entry cost and similar riding experience.\n\nUsers can improve the 105 experience by swapping out the cables on the bicycle every 1,000 miles or so to keep them operating in a smooth fashion. The climbing gears aren\u2019t as low, but that doesn\u2019t tend to be problematic unless there are several hills around a home that need regular climbing or it is a racing event. The Ultegra can save the legs for a final sprint, but the 105 can provide consistent flat course results.\n\nUltimately the 105 is geared toward cyclists who want to have a consistent result from their equipment, but don\u2019t want to spend the extra cash to upgrade to the Ultegra. You can pretty much fir the 105 and then forget it. It\u2019s a no-nonsense gruppo that gets the job done.\n\nWhy Choose the Shimano Gruppos?\n\nWhether you choose the 105 or the Ultegra, Shimano has one distinct advantage: their policy of tricke-down technology. The new groupsets aren\u2019t introduced to the general riding public first like other manufacturers tend to do. They are first issued to professional riders to test out the product. As their capabilities become known, the technology comes down into the bikes for everyone after the technology has been tweaked so that it is virtually perfect. You will get value for your investment into the Shimano name.\n\nThe bottom line for the comparison between the 105 and the Ultegra, however, is this: invest into the Ultegra if you can afford to do so. Although it may be an additional $450+ to get the Ultegra gruppo, the benefits of better gears, better resale value, and better climbing and descending. Some might not see the half pound advantage and the gear shape as an advantage and that\u2019s where the 105 becomes a better option.",

    "content": "Growing up, I used to get zits \u2013 like any teenager. It seemed impossible to eliminate acne or get rid of pimples.\n\nHowever, I remember this one time when I got this massive mountain of a pimple on the crease of my nose.\n\nThe real problem was that the girl I liked, pointed to it in front of other girls and said \u201cgeez Sam, what the hell is that on your nose, that\u2019s disgusting!\u2026\u201d or something like that.\n\nEveryone laughed and I played it cool and kinda laughed as well, but it hurt. It was embarrassing.\n\nI remember going to the drug store the next day and getting like half a dozen \u201canti-acne\u201d products to put on my face. It was a mess and all it did was then dry out my skin and aggravate things even more.\n\nI tell you this story because, in the end, I did put in a lot of time and effort trying to figure out how to have really good, clean, healthy skin.\n\nAfter all, your skin is your biggest organ.\n\nHealthy skin means a healthy body.\n\nHealthy skin is also very attractive.\n\nIf you\u2019re getting pimples on your body or zits on your face, then that means there\u2019s an imbalance in your body. And as usual, the primary cause is HORMONES!\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to quickly give the causes of acne and then, proven solutions.\n\nAnd trust me, what I\u2019ll share with you today WORKS and it works almost every single time.\n\nJust be patient and you\u2019ll see the results.\n\nFirst of all, there\u2019s never a \u201csingle cause\u201d for anything in the body \u2013 acne is no exception to this rule. However, the 5 primary reasons are:\n\nHormones \u2013 the most important factor.\n\nBacteria \u2013 these are skin bacteria (hygiene), as well as GUT bacteria, which again \u2013 affect hormones.\n\nStress (emotional, mental & physical) \u2013 this again, affects your hormones.\n\nYour Diet \u2013 yup, affects hormones.\n\nThere might be some other causes, such as drugs \u2013 but these are the top 5 and most important ones for you to fix.\n\nAnd just to let you know, the reason you get a pimple is because hair follicles become clogged by a combination of dead skin and oils/sebum from your sebaceous glands.\n\nNow, sometimes a person will say \u201cbut I got a zit on my forehead, there\u2019s no hair there\u201d. Yes, there is hair on your forehead. You have hair all over your body. It\u2019s just that in some places it\u2019s large and you can see it and in other places like your forehead, it\u2019s tiny and can only be seen with a magnifying glass.\n\nSo, with that said, let\u2019s address each problem and the solutions, so you can have clear skin and feel more confident and attractive.\n\nGenetics plays a role in everything. And yes, some people just don\u2019t have the best of skin genetics.\n\nHOWEVER, that does NOT mean that you can\u2019t have great skin. You just have to make improvements in your lifestyle, with what I\u2019m sharing today \u2013 so you can actually turn OFF your \u201cacne-causing genes\u201d.\n\nYes, many genes can be turned on or off \u2013 so, you\u2019re not doomed.\n\nHormonal Pimple Party\n\nHormones always play a role in everything.\n\nIn the pimple party on your face and body, the primary hormones are:\n\nThis is primarily the male hormone, but women have it too.\n\nHOWEVER, testosterone is good. It doesn\u2019t really cause zits. What testosterone CONVERTS to, is the real problem and that\u2019s:\n\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT):\n\nThis is a known cause of acne, hair growth on the body, and hair loss on the head. Men have more of this, but women have a higher % of it than men.\n\nA simple way to lower excess amounts of it, WITHOUT negatively affecting your sex drive, is to take Zinc.\n\nTake about 30 mgs daily of Zinc Picolinate or a mixture. This will improve your hormones and reduce pimples.\n\nThen we have estrogen, the REAL problem. In men, high estrogen coupled with high male hormones (testosterone and DHT) is probably the BIGGEST cause of zits in guys. But not so much in women.\n\nSo, you want to lower estrogen to a low/normal range. Taking supplements such as DIM and White Button Mushroom extract will help.\n\nAlso, avoid soy and other proteins that are not \u201cnatural\u201d because they are full of hormones. So, eat fresh, natural, pasture-raised, grass-fed proteins.\n\nIn a minute I\u2019ll tell you about more foods to avoid.\n\nCortisol is your stress hormone. And stress comes in many different forms \u2014 mental, emotional, physical, etc. When stress hormones go up, a lot of other hormones go down.\n\nTaking herbs such as Phosphatidylserine, Ashwagandha, and high doses of Vit C will help lower excess cortisol.\n\nMake sure to get enough rest, sunshine, and think positive thoughts. Negative, angry thoughts release a lot of stress hormones the entire day and if you\u2019re sensitive to zits, you\u2019ll get them right away.\n\nInsulin is a hormone and this goes up, in order to lower high blood sugar levels.\n\nThis means stay away from junky carbohydrates such as sugars, sodas, bread, pastries and packaged foods.\n\nOh, and make sure you stay away from DAIRY \u2013 it\u2019s one of the worst foods for causing acne. And it\u2019s because it\u2019s very insulinogenic and also full of hormones!\n\nBacteria is a major cause of pimples as well. You have bacteria on your skin. This means you need to keep your skin CLEAN.\n\nExfoliate and wash daily. Don\u2019t over-dry your skin either. Use clean, simple, and natural cleansers.\n\nClean your face with Witch Hazel \u2013 it\u2019s super inexpensive and works great. Do this twice daily.\n\nThen you have gut bacteria, which affects everything in your body.\n\nAgain, eat healthy foods, take lots of fiber, eat vegetables, and make sure you take pre and probiotics, in addition to caprylic acid \u2013 which comes in a pill or just have coconut oil.\n\nI already covered stress. Your MINDSET is so important to your health, including causing pimples.\n\nMake sure you get enough rest. Also, if you\u2019re taking a lot of stimulants, such as caffeine, (yup, that means coffee and energy drinks) then cut them out or reduce them. They burn out your adrenal glands and cause higher stress hormones.\n\nYes, diet always matters because what you eat or don\u2019t eat, affects your hormones. I\u2019ve already gone through a bunch of suggestions.\n\nOne thing I will mention again is that DAIRY is a huge cause of acne. Remove ALL dairy. No milk, no yogurt, definitely no cheese, and read all ingredients \u2013 because they put dairy in a lot of things.\n\nBy the way, this also means no whey protein. Most protein powders are dairy \u2013 not healthy, especially for your skin if you want to not have zits.\n\nAnother trick I\u2019ve got for eliminating acne is to take Pantethine (B5) 750 mg with 250 mg of L Carnitine each, three times per day.\n\nSummary \u2013 Eliminate Acne Today\n\nI\u2019ve given you a lot of suggestions here because there\u2019s never a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d, especially for those that are very sensitive to acne.\n\nPlease read this article again, since I covered a lot. Take action on what I\u2019ve suggested, even on a couple of things.\n\nFor example, eliminate all dairy, take pre and probiotics, and take Pantethine (B5) 750 mg with 250 mg of L Carnitine three times per day. This is a simple and very effective start.\n\nIf you\u2019re a man, make sure you optimize your hormones.\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman, you tend to have more fluctuations in stress hormones, which can cause anxiety, panic attacks, even depression. So, make sure you optimize your stress hormones.\n\nBe patient. It takes time. But beautiful, acne-free skin is so worth it.\n\nPlus, all of these suggestions reduce wrinkles too.",
