You can slow it down and maintain high hormone levels naturally into your 60s and beyond.\n\nFor women and menopause, hormonal assistance is usually needed.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss/why-are-italians-skinny-if-they-eat-lots-of-carbs-fats/",
    "content": "I got an interesting question the other day:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam, I\u2019m curious to know why people in Italy are so skinny even though they eat lots of carbohydrates, fats, and creams like pasta, bread, pizza, cheese, wine, and so forth? Is it their genetics, hormones, or something else? I really wish I could eat pizza, pasta, and bread all day long. So what\u2019s the secret? =)\u201d\n\nWell, since I am part French and Italian and have also lived in Italy, I can give you some insight.\n\nFirst off, people in Italy are not \u201cso skinny\u201d. There are plenty of overweight people there and that could simply be because of the modern society we all live in.\n\nAnd also, so much of the Western world and lifestyle has now been adopted by almost all other countries, including Italy.\n\nHowever, I do know what you mean or what you\u2019re trying to say here \u2013 how can people in Italy, eat all of these yummy foods and yet, look healthy, not be super overweight, and so forth?\u2026\n\nAs with everything, there\u2019s never one specific answer. However, allow me to share some things about Italian culture and food.\n\nFood In Italy Is Different Than US\n\nFirst, the type of foods people eat in Italy is way different than in the US.\n\nFor example, pizza in Italy is different. It has a thinner crust, less cheese, less meat, more vegetables, herbs, and so forth. Thus, it has fewer calories.\n\nHowever, in the US, the pizza crust is super high in calories \u2013 with a TON of cheese crammed into every inch of the pizza, topped with lots of horrible meat like sausages, pepperoni, and so forth.\n\nObviously, it tastes great, but the calorie content and type of ingredients are very different.\n\nDifferent Type of Milk\n\nContinuing with our pizza example, since it\u2019s my favorite food\u2026\n\nIn the US, we use horrible milk that\u2019s loaded with casein type 1, while in Italy and other parts of the world like France, they have casein type 2 milk. What\u2019s the difference?\u2026\n\nThe milk in America, Casein type 1, causes stomach problems, gas, bloat, and thus, a lot of inflammation.\n\nAnd, inflammation causes fat gain and negative changes in your hormones. It increases cortisol, your stress hormone.\n\nIn fact, years ago I used to think it was the lactose that was the problem, the milk sugar. However, I can have goat\u2019s milk and I\u2019m fine. That\u2019s made of casein type 2, not 1.\n\nAnd the same with the smaller, less milk-producing cows in other countries \u2013 they are type 2 casein, while in the US, it\u2019s the bad, type 1.\n\nThe US cows are also fed harmful corn, soy, and other junk. They\u2019re given lots of antibiotics and thus, all of this leads to inferior, harmful milk that shouldn\u2019t be eaten.\n\nIt\u2019s also high in omega 6, which causes even more inflammation.\n\nWhile casein type 2 and grass-fed cows have more CLA \u2013 a fat that reduces inflammation and actually helps burn fat.\n\nIt\u2019s About Your Fat Burning Hormones\n\nThis is just ONE example of how the foods in Italy are different than the US and thus, your body reacts differently.\n\nThus, different foods produce different hormones in the body \u2013 either fat BURNING or fat PRODUCING hormones.\n\nLike I\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s all about your hormones.\n\nItalians also eat 3 main meals daily and take their time to eat. They eat slowly.\n\nThey enjoy their food and do so with friends and family. This produces positive hormones.\n\nWhile in America, we are eating on the run. We try to eat as much food, in as little time as possible. And many do so while watching TV.\n\nAll of this causes you to eat much more food and calories.\n\nIn Italy, people also walk a lot more, especially after a meal.\n\nI\u2019ve stated in my previous articles, that simply taking a 10-15 walk after each meal, will do wonders for weight loss, supporting healthy blood sugar, and reducing stress hormones.\n\nAgain, optimal hormonal balance = better fat loss because the foods get digested and absorbed better.\n\nThey\u2019re used for energy, fuel, and repair, rather than fat storage.\n\nDifferent Preparation Of Food\n\nItalian foods and the preparation of foods also have much fewer lectins, which again, cause inflammation and hormonal imbalances.\n\nSo, you want to avoid lectin-containing foods \u2013 which is the majority of the US diet.\n\nItalians have more olive oil and healthy fats, rather than soybean and corn oil, which are high in omega-6 fats.\n\nWhich again, causes inflammation and hormonal imbalance \u2013 leading to fat storage, rather than fat burning.\n\nItalians have lots of fresh vegetables and fruits with their meals. It\u2019s natural and full of healthy polyphenols, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nThus, their foods contain more nutrients, not just high in calories.\n\nIt\u2019s About What They Do NOT Eat\n\nAnd at the end of the day, it\u2019s not even about what foods they eat \u2013 but more so about the food, they do NOT eat or drink.\n\nThey aren\u2019t drinking soda, high fructose corn syrup, or other high-calorie drinks. It\u2019s mainly water, coffee, tea, some wine, and beer.\n\nThey don\u2019t have huge portion sizes as we do in the US, it\u2019s much smaller. Probably half the size or maybe even 1/4th.\n\nFoods in Italy also have far fewer preservatives, toxins, and so forth. All of which, again, improves hormones and gut health.\n\nIn fact, their government regulations are far stricter than we have in the US. Many countries are, especially in Europe.\n\nSo What Does This Mean For You?\n\nAt the end of the day, YOU can also eat lots of yummy foods, if you:\n\nDon\u2019t overeat, so watch your portion sizes and eat slowly.\n\nWalk after your meals.\n\nEat more naturally prepared foods \u2013 organic foods, lots of fresh vegetables, fruits, and healthy naturally occurring fats like Olive oil and avocados.\n\nAvoid eating bad, man-made, pre-packaged foods.\n\nDon\u2019t drink your calories, this is a big one for most people.\n\nThe bottom line is that it\u2019s all about optimizing your fat-burning hormones. By doing so, you can improve your genetics, the way a skinny person is.\n\nI have 2 very important links for you.\n\nOne reveals a formula for supporting your fat-burning hormones.\n\nAnd the seconds go to an article series revealing the Top 10 Weight Loss Myths.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "I think the internet is an amazing invention and has allowed all of us to \u201cgrow\u201d in so many ways. You have access to so much information and so many people \u2013 which is great.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the biggest problems with all of this extra information is that the majority of it is WRONG. There\u2019s just so much inaccurate and false information.\n\nAt best, you\u2019ll find partially correct information.\n\nAnd for me, this is a big frustration, especially when it comes to health.\n\nI have to spend (more like waste!) so much more time researching and digging around to get to the core facts of what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false.\n\nThe Biggest Weight Loss Myths\n\nAnd weight loss is no different.\n\nThere\u2019s just a lot of bad advice. Most of it is completely unproven or literally, proven to NOT work.\n\nSo I\u2019ve decided to list the Top 10 biggest myths and lies about weight loss because I know how important this topic is \u2013 if not for health reasons, certainly for vanity.\n\nHowever, instead of making one long article, I\u2019m going to make 10, smaller \u201cmini\u201d articles.\n\nThis makes it easy to absorb the information and allows you to implement the simple and proven solution the same day, so you get quick results.\n\nIt\u2019ll be easy and fun.\n\nOkay, so let\u2019s start with:\n\nMyth #1: All \u201cCalories\u201d Are Equal\n\nWhen it comes to weight loss, most experts focus on total calories you eat or calories your burn.\n\nFor example, if you eat 3000 calories daily, a dietician will say \u201ccut out 500 calories and eat 2500 calories daily, so you can lose a pound of fat each week\u201d.\n\nBut, this doesn\u2019t work in real life\u2026 certainly not over a longer time frame.\n\nDifferent foods, macronutrients and even combinations of foods, go through different metabolic pathways and can have vastly different effects on your digestion, nutrient partitioning, metabolism, hunger and the hormones that regulate your body WEIGHT and FAT percentage.\n\nDifferences In Calories\n\nFor example, a protein calorie is not the same as a fat calorie or a carb calorie.\n\nProteins and Carbohydrates have 4 calories per gram. While fats have 9 calories per gram, that\u2019s more than double the calories.\n\nHowever, this does NOT mean you should avoid fats because the right types of fats increase your metabolism by improving your hormones.\n\nOr if you increase your protein, while decreasing your carbs and/or fats, you\u2019ll boost your metabolism, and reduce appetite and cravings, while optimizing the function of some weight-regulating hormones. 1, 2, 3\n\nSolid Vs Liquid Foods\n\nSolid foods, that require you to chew and digest them, increase your metabolism far more than drinking your calories \u2014 even if it\u2019s the same amount of calories.\n\nAlso, calories from whole foods (like fruit) tend to be much more filling than calories from refined foods (like candy) because of the water, fiber and nutrient content.\n\nHere\u2019s The Most Important Think To Know\n\nThe most important thing I can tell you is that your body runs on NUTRIENTS, not calories.\n\nEmpty calories like pastries, sugars, processed foods and so forth do nothing to FEED your cells and thus, your body and brain become hungry an hour or two later.\n\nThe \u201cenergy\u201d doesn\u2019t last very long.\n\nIt\u2019s All About Your Hormones\n\nHowever, nutrient-dense foods such as proteins, healthy fats, healthy carbohydrates, and vegetables\u2026 give your cells what they need, to convert the food into energy, instead of being stored as fat.\n\nThey\u2019ll increase your metabolism by producing GOOD, youthful hormones.\n\nAnd when it comes to weight loss (MOST things in your body), it\u2019s all about your hormones!\n\nAnd in the next article, I\u2019ll give you shortcuts on how you can improve your hormones, so you\u2019ll have a\n\nfaster metabolism reduced cravings have more energy and less belly fat \u2026\n\nSimilar to people who have \u201cskinny/lean\u201d genetics.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25926512\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424378/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258944/",

    "content": "Most people would like to lose weight. And many people NEED to, for simple health reasons.\n\nAnd there are also many people who may not need to or want to lose weight, but they would love to lose just some fat \u2013 especially that stubborn belly fat and have super lean 6-pack abs.\n\nUnfortunately, the topic of weight loss is filled with so much misinformation or fad diets, that most people either never achieve their weight loss goals or simply can\u2019t even maintain them.\n\nThus, they go from one diet to the next.\n\nThey gain and lose the same weight over and over again and in the process, just end up losing muscle and gaining more fat, while screwing up their metabolisms and hormones.\n\nThe end result is frustration, hopelessness, and the feeling of failure.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to keep it super simple and short and reveal the top 5 biggest weight loss myths.\n\nThere are many others, but I feel these tend to be repeated over and over again.\n\nPlus, I\u2019ll give you links to more detailed articles about each of today\u2019s myths, so you can get specifics and the dos and don\u2019ts.\n\n#1 \u2013 All Calories Are Equal\n\nThis means that people think at the end of the day, it\u2019s just about how many calories you take in. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s protein, fat, or carbs \u2026 or even what TYPE of protein, fat, or carbs.\n\nNo, all calories are not the same and each produces different metabolic and hormonal changes in your body, resulting in different body composition.\n\nFaster or slower metabolism\n\nBuilding or losing muscle\n\nDifferent fat distribution (more or less belly fat or visceral fat)\n\n#2 \u2013 Carbs Make You Fat\n\nThese days, being on a ketogenic, NO-carb diet is a hot topic again. A diet that I first did in 1994.\n\nAgain, another fad and extreme diet stating how carbohydrates are the devil and they cause you to get fat because of high blood sugar and thus, higher insulin levels \u2013 the \u201cfat storage\u201d hormone.\n\nTrust me, there are LOTS of people on no-carb, high-fat ketogenic diets who are fat and in fact, getting even fatter with that type of diet.\n\nYou need carbohydrates, especially if you exercise and I think EVERYONE should be moving more and exercising daily.\n\nI don\u2019t know a single, healthy, and happy person who has been on a no-carb diet for months and years on end.\n\nNOT A SINGLE PERSON and I\u2019ve been doing this for over 3 DECADES.\n\nAs with everything, the wrong carbs and quantity will make you fat. As will eating the wrong types of fats make you fat.\n\nThere are good and bad carbs, just as there are good and bad fats and proteins as well.\n\nIt\u2019s all about making the right choices, based on the correct knowledge.\n\nPlease stop with the extreme diets \u2013 they NEVER work long-term and will only cause you more metabolic damage.\n\n#3 \u2013 Eat Less & Move More\n\nAnother simplistic view is that you simply need to eat fewer calories and/or move more to burn excess calories.\n\nThis simplistic diet strategy, like all diets, works initially\u2026\n\nBut then, your body quickly adapts and there are negative metabolic and hormonal changes because your body wants you to STOP losing weight.\n\nI think this is a good start, but WHAT you eat, HOW much, the correct ratios, and so forth,\n\nALL affect your hormones, your energy levels, appetite, and so forth \u2013 which matters the most.\n\n#4 \u2013 Losing Weight Is About Willpower\n\nThis one is really lame because willpower will only go so far, with anything and everything in life.\n\nYou need to select the right type of diet and food, based on YOUR goals, genetics, lifestyle, likes, and dislikes.\n\nAs a simple example \u2013 I think fish, especially salmon is a great source of protein and healthy fats \u2013 both being essential to fat loss.\n\nBut if you hate fish and can\u2019t stand it in any way, shape, or form \u2013 I\u2019m not going to yell at you and say \u201cYou have no willpower\u201d and force you to eat it, daily\u2026 right?\n\nHealthy, long-term weight loss should NEVER be about willpower or how much you suffer, or what you can tolerate.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t work with relationships, with making money, and it won\u2019t work with your body.\n\n#5 \u2013 Supplements Don\u2019t Work\n\nI\u2019ve been taking supplements for years and years. In fact, the older I get, the more I take.\n\nI remember how in the old days, so many people, especially physicians, would call them \u201cexpensive urine\u201d.\n\nAnd you know what, MOST (but not all) supplements and products are a waste of time and money.\n\nI would say that 95% of supplements contain junk ingredients, making false claims.\n\nHowever, the right form, dose, and extract \u2013 can be EXTREMELY effective for:\n\nincreasing your metabolism\n\ndecreasing your appetite\n\nboosting your energy levels\n\nand most importantly, improving your fat-burning hormones\n\nYou just have to make sure they are clinically validated ingredients and have a long, proven history of both effectiveness and safety.\n\nAnd below, I\u2019ve listed the best fat-burning ingredients and formulas. One with almost 2 decades of research.\n\nPlus, you\u2019ll discover how to turn on your fat-burning genes and why most diets and exercise plans don\u2019t work.\n\nThere are lots of weight loss myths, but these are some of the 5 biggest ones I wanted to discuss today.\n\nAt the end of the day, it all comes down to genetics and hormones. THAT\u2019S IT!\n\nAnyone who argues this point is either ignorant or just an idiot.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve stated before, you may not be able to change your genetics, but your lifestyle and mindset can definitely alter your hormones, which can trigger genes to go on or off, and express the good or bad ones.\n\nWhich is also called epigenetics.\n\nTrust me when I tell you that ALL of my clients get amazing results because of this one key factor \u2013 I work with their genetics and improve their hormones with diet, exercise, stress management, and supplements, that\u2019s it!\n\nA simple idea, yet a complex strategy to execute.\n\nAnd with that said, I\u2019ve got a few important links about more details about today\u2019s top 5 myths:\n\nSupplements Don\u2019t Work\n\nAll Calories Are Equal\n\nEating Fat Makes You Fat\n\nEat Less & Move More Is The Secret To Losing Weight\n\nAnd if you want to speed up your weight loss, with less effort and improve your \u201cfat-burning\u201d hormones at the same time \u2026 try this.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Welcome back to my 10 multi-part series about the \u201c10 Biggest Myths & Lies About Weight Loss.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Myth #7 is that Eating Less & Moving More Is The Secret To Losing Weight.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re joining me for the first time and you missed the first 6 weight loss myths, I suggest you check them out at some point after today\u2019s article.\n\nBody fat is simply stored energy (calories).\n\nMost \u201cexperts\u201d will tell you that something like a \u201cpound of fat is 3500 calories.\u201d And to lose weight or body fat, more calories need to be leaving your fat cells than entering them.\n\nIn other words, if there\u2019s a caloric deficit (more out, than in), fat loss occurs.\n\nFor this reason, it seems only logical that \u201ceating less and moving more\u201d would cause weight loss. It works on both sides of the calorie equation.\n\nHowever, this advice usually doesn\u2019t work. It for sure doesn\u2019t work for people who are very overweight (50+ lbs). And for the rest of the people who want to erase some of the belly fat, get healthier and look more attractive \u2013 this formula backfires in the long-run.\n\nMost people who follow this advice end up gaining the weight back, and there are physiological, psychological and biochemical reasons for this.1\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve stated over and over again, how you look and feel is based on your genetics and your genetics are controlled by all the various different hormones, enzymes and so forth.\n\nSo you can\u2019t change your DNA, but you CAN and MUST make improvements in your hormones\u2026 especially as you get older.\n\nIn fact, you see this quickly in women who hit menopause. All of a sudden, they gain weight in their stomach and lose it in their breast and face. The fat distribution becomes more like a man\u2019s and this is because of the lowering of female hormones, thyroid, and other hormonal changes.\n\nDiet and exercise are a big part of this. So is stress management and utilizing specific herbs, vitamins and minerals that are clinically proven to turn on your \u201cfat-burning hormones.\u201d\n\nIn fact, I can have you eat the same amount of calories, but by changing the type of foods you eat, what kind of exercises you do and when you do them, managing your stress hormones, and optimizing your fat-burning hormones with natural herbal extracts \u2013 you can lose fat and gain muscle at the same time.\n\nWITHOUT reducing any calories at all. And, you\u2019ll have more energy in the process.\n\nAgain, it all has to do with your hormones.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve tried to \u201ceat less and move more\u201d and it hasn\u2019t worked out for you, now you know why.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Welcome back to my 10 multi-part series about the \u201c10 Biggest Myths & Lies About Weight Loss.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Myth #8 is that Losing Weight Is About Will Power\n\nAnd if you\u2019re joining me for the first time and you missed the first 7 weight loss myths, I suggest you check them out at some point after today\u2019s article.\n\nNow, the other day I was having lunch with a client who is one of these fitness models and actors with great genetics. He\u2019s actually very well-known, but I\u2019m not going to name him.\n\nAnyway, there was someone eating lunch at the table next to us and they were overweight.\n\nMy \u201cfitness model/actor\u201d friend then made a stupid, insensitive, and yet, a very common comment which was \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this person just control what they eat. They are obviously lazy and have no willpower. Just eat less and exercise more \u2013 it\u2019s not rocket science\u201d.\n\nI then said \u201cyes, you\u2019re right \u2026 it\u2019s not rocket science, it\u2019s much more complicated!\u201d\n\nYou see, obesity is a very complex disorder with dozens, if not hundreds of contributing factors.\n\nThere are numerous genetic variables that have been shown to be associated with obesity, and various medical conditions (hypothyroidism, PCOS, depression) that can increase the risk of weight gain, and making weight loss so much more difficult.\n\nThe body also has numerous hormones and biological pathways that are supposed to regulate body weight. These tend to be dysfunctional in people with obesity, making it much harder to lose weight and keep it off.\n\nNot only are there various hormones and peptides \u2013 such as thyroids, sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, etc.), GH, IGF, Insulin, etc\u2026 there are hundreds of enzymatic pathways \u2026 NOT to mention, receptor sensitivity, fat cell sizes, quantity, the type of fat your body has (brown vs white) and so on and so forth.\n\nGenetics plays a major role and your lifestyle can actually turn ON or OFF or magnify or minify these genetic factors.\n\nFor example, being resistant to the hormone leptin is a major cause of obesity.\n\nThe leptin signal is supposed to tell your brain that it has enough fat stored. When the leptin isn\u2019t managing to deliver its signal, the brain thinks that you are starving.\n\nTrying to exert \u201cwillpower\u201d and consciously eating less in the face of the leptin-driven starvation signal is extremely difficult, if not impossible for many people.\n\nThere are even infants that are obese. How can anyone blame that on personal responsibility or a lack of willpower? It is very clear that there are biological factors at play.\n\nEating is driven by behavior, and behavior is driven by physiology and biochemistry. That is an undeniable fact.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean that people should just give up and accept their genetic fate. Losing weight is still possible, it is just much harder for some people.\n\nThey need to put in the extra effort with what they eat and drink, the type of exercise and duration, managing their stress levels and optimizing their fat-burning hormones.\n\nNow, you can never change your genetics, but you CAN turn on your \u201cfat-burning\u201d genes, so it makes it easier for you to lose fat, reduce your appetite, increase your metabolism and keep the weight off, long-term.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading and have a happy and healthy day!\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Whether it\u2019s for vanity or health reasons, most of us want to lose weight\u2026\n\nEspecially those stubborn areas like belly fat and \u201clove handles\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, most of us seem to make one excuse after another as to why we haven\u2019t achieved our weight loss goals\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the TIME\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the ENERGY\u201d\u2026\n\nOf course, there are dozens of ways to lose weight, and almost every diet or exercise program works, if you stick to it long enough.\n\nYes, some are more effective than others. And some are easier than others.\n\nThe good news is that today I\u2019m going to give you super simple, easy, and very effective tips that are proven to increase your metabolism and burn stubborn fat areas for fast weight loss.\n\nAnd it\u2019s everything you can do at home, so you have no excuses.\n\nRemember, the simple formula for weight loss is to burn MORE calories than you eat/drink.\n\nSo let\u2019s start with what you eat and eliminate \u201chidden\u201d calories and addictive foods, which cause cravings.\n\nDon\u2019t DRINK your calories! This means no soda, juice, alcohol, or any other beverage that contains calories, such as coffee drinks. They just have too many calories and are high in sugar. Instead, have water, tea, and black coffee.\n\nNO sauces! Salad dressings, BBQ sauce, ketchup, etc. They have a lot of calories, sugars, and fats. Instead, have vinegar, lemon juice, and mustard. Use salt and pepper for additional seasoning and taste.\n\nNO packaged foods! They\u2019re loaded with sugars, fats, carbs, etc. They also have lots of additives that cause food addictions and cravings. The food industry is worse than the pharmaceutical companies.\n\nReducing and eliminating these 3 types of foods will go a LONG way in reducing your calories, improving your fat-burning hormones, and eliminating foods that have no nutrients, just empty calories.\n\nTrying to lose weight with diet alone is a bad idea. It\u2019ll take twice as long and it\u2019ll be twice as hard.\n\nSo let\u2019s burn MORE calories with some simple exercises you can do at home.\n\nWalking \u2014 Try to take a brisk walk every day. It can be first thing in the morning around your neighborhood. Or during your lunch break at work. Or in the evening when you get home.Your initial goal should be at least 15-20 minutes, 3x weekly. Work up to 30-45 minutes, 5-7x weekly. You can also break it up into multiple smaller sessions. Like 20 min in the morning and 20 minutes at night.It\u2019s relaxing. It\u2019s easy. It can be done anywhere and it\u2019s great for your hormones.\n\nLift Weights \u2014 The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn.If you can\u2019t go to the gym, you can always get some weights or cables at home. Or just use your own body weight.There are lots of bodyweight exercises and workouts you can do. Squats, lunges, pushups, pullups, situps, etc. YouTube has lots of videos. You don\u2019t need much. Just 15-20 minutes, 3x weekly is plenty to start with. Later you can work up to 30 minutes, 3-4x weekly. You don\u2019t need any more than that.\n\nIf you want to accelerate your progress and get faster results, you can also take specific supplements, herbs, and vitamins that can safely\n\nincrease your metabolism\n\nreduce your cravings and appetite\n\nThe correct \u201cformula\u201d can actually \u201cturn ON\u201d your fat-burning genes, similar to a \u201cskinny\u201d person.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to first get rid of those hidden calories and make sure you do some form of exercise daily.\n\nThe secret is to just get started TODAY. Don\u2019t overcomplicate it because then you won\u2019t take action.\n\nThat\u2019s why I kept this article short with a few simple action plans that are proven to work and that you can apply right now and start seeing results quickly.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

They think a \u201ccarb\u201d is a \u201c4 letter word\u201d.\n\nYet, the irony is that people\u2019s weights have been going UP, despite all of the \u201cketogenic\u201d or \u201clow carb\u201d diets.\n\nYou need carbs for a variety of reasons \u2013 mainly for maintaining optimal fat-burning hormones\u2026 such as\n\nlowering cortisol levels (stress hormone)\n\nand optimizing your thyroid hormones (faster metabolism).\n\nHOWEVER, what type or kind of carbs you eat, the amount, when you eat them and what you eat it WITH all matter.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s all about optimizing your fat-burning, youth hormones.\n\nNow, in today\u2019s article, I\u2019m going to list the 7 best carbs for losing belly fat and increasing your energy levels.\n\nIn a future article, I\u2019ll give you some cool tips on when to eat them, what to mix them with and so forth for additional fat-burning, hormone-optimizing benefits.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s start with the 7 best carbs and I put them in order of importance.\n\nVegetables are a great source of carbohydrates.\n\nThey\u2019re low in calories, don\u2019t raise your blood sugar levels, help alkalize your body, digest your foods and are high in fiber.\n\nEat as much as you want. Eat a variety of colors. I suggest you steam them, add in a little bit of sea salt and lemon juice for taste.\n\nAnd eat them FIRST, at the beginning of your meal to help fill you up.\n\nBroccoli is one of the best vegetables. High in protein. But most vegetables are good.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d avoid or reduce \u201cnightshade\u201d vegetables because many people are sensitive to them and don\u2019t digest them well. These are typically potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant and peppers.\n\nI\u2019d also suggest you avoid some forms of mushrooms because they are a fungus.\n\nA great alternative to pasta and noodles, Konjac is a vegetable and not really even a carb. Also known as \u2018slim pasta\u2019 it is essentially all fiber, therefore contains no fat, no sugar and no carbs.\n\nDoesn\u2019t raise blood sugar and it\u2019s gluten-free.\n\nAnd it\u2019s less than 10 calories per 100 grams.\n\nPerfect if you\u2019re dieting.\n\nYams / Sweet Potatoes\n\nYams and sweet potatoes are very similar. Most of the time yams are what you can purchase.\n\nThey are healthier than regular potatoes. Lower blood sugar response. High in antioxidants.\n\nThey are also very sweet, which is helpful if you have a \u201csweet tooth\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve made articles about this already\u2026\n\nWhite rice is very healthy, and I think better than brown rice.\n\nAnd if you cook it a special way, you can instantly cut the calories by 50% for the SAME amount of rice.\n\nOats are naturally gluten-free, but when cross-contaminated with Rye, Barley and Wheat in farming or processing equipment, these grains become gluten-sensitive food.\n\nSo, look for \u201cgluten-free\u201d on the package.\n\nOats digest slowly, are high in fiber, don\u2019t raise your blood sugar much, and have lots of vitamins and minerals.\n\nQuinoa is a seed and is considered a complete protein because it contains all eight essential amino acids.\n\nMost grains are lacking in at least one amino acid, therefore this makes it a great protein source for vegans or vegetarians.\n\nQuinoa is also high in fiber, very low blood sugar response, and can actually help reduce your appetite.\n\nBeans and lentils are very good for you.\n\nSuper high in fiber, very low blood sugar response, and slow to digest \u2014 which all means that you\u2019re full for a very long time.\n\nIt\u2019s also high in protein.\n\nUnfortunately, beans are hard to digest for many people and also contain Lectins, which aren\u2019t good for some people.\n\nHowever, if you cook them in a pressure cooker, this removes the lectins and makes them much healthier for you.\n\nSo, if you want to lose fat and have more energy, do your best to eat more:\n\nRemember, the point with all of this is to increase your fat-burning hormones, like when you were younger and to turn ON your \u201cfat-burning\u201d genes.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I recently had a subscriber ask me if intermittent fasting will slow down his metabolism?\u2026 It\u2019s a good question since intermittent fasting is a popular topic these days \u2014 AGAIN.\n\nI say \u201cagain\u201d because, like any fad diet, it shows up every decade or so, then disappears, and then, reappears\u2026 over and over again.\n\nJust like most people\u2019s weight loss attempts \u2014 they keep losing the same weight, OVER AND OVER again.\n\nPersonally, I think intermittent fasting, just like a ketogenic diet, has some health benefits \u2013 IF it\u2019s done correctly. Unfortunately, most do it all wrong.\n\nYES, they get benefits at the beginning. But ALL diets work in the beginning. That\u2019s easy.\n\nThe hard part is to continue and to have long-term FAT loss.\n\nAnd the keyword here is FAT LOSS, not \u201cweight loss\u201d which is usually valuable muscle.\n\nThis is because as your body adapts, fat loss slows down, stops, and then reverses.\n\nSome will say \u201cI\u2019m still losing weight\u201d, which is true \u2013 but now they are losing a lot more valuable muscle, instead of fat.\n\nThis is how your body survives.\n\nIts only goal is to adapt.\n\nAnd, in the process, your metabolism slows down in order for you to survive and not keep losing weight forever.\n\nTwo Popular Intermittent Fasting Protocols\n\nThere are two popular types of intermittent fasting.\n\nThere\u2019s the weekly 5:2, which is eating normally for 5 days and then fasting for 2.\n\nThen there\u2019s the daily 16:8. Which is fasting for 16 hours and eating for 8.\n\nAnd people do lose fat and weight because of this and the primary reason for many is the fact that they are simply eating less calories, which is great.\n\nYes, intermittent fasting has beneficial hormonal changes \u2013 such as higher growth hormone, testosterone, lower insulin levels, and so forth\u2026 initially, at the beginning.\n\nBut all of that stops working after a few weeks and months. However, the improved insulin sensitivity continues.\n\nAnd I know this because, after 30 years, I\u2019ve seen hundreds of blood tests with all sorts of various diets. Not just after a few weeks, but long-term, such as 6 and 12 months and 2 years later, when the REAL problems start to show up.\n\nWhen people\u2019s metabolisms, hormones, thyroid, and so forth have really shut down. When they\u2019re barely eating anything and still can\u2019t lose any weight.\n\nThey ALL Slow Down Your Metabolism\n\nSimply stated, any diet that restricts calories too much, too fast and for too long, will slow down your metabolism.\n\nI know of a few experts and doctors who eat just ONE meal a day and they brag about how much weight they\u2019ve lost. But they\u2019re barely eating 1000 calories.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to consume enough required protein in ONE meal.\n\nTRUST ME, their metabolisms have slowed down, along with their hormones.\n\nAnd it shows since they just look skinny-fat. The more weight they lose, the more MUSCLE loss it is.\n\nIf you want to do intermittent fasting and still optimize your hormones, I suggest you CYCLE it.\n\nEvery 6-12 weeks, take 3-7 days off and eat normally and increase your calories by 10-20%. This will jump-start your hormones, and reboot your system.\n\nIf you feel the fat loss has stopped for a couple of weeks, that\u2019s a clue to stop, consume extra calories and then start again with the diet.\n\nFor some, this happens faster and sooner than others.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s all about your hormones. Your body will adapt by turning off your fat-burning, muscle-growing hormones.\n\nIT will sense mild starvation and will do its best to preserve fat and start burning muscle slowly.\n\nIt will for sure, increase cortisol levels and other stress hormones, which TRUMPS all other hormones \u2014 growth hormone, testosterone, insulin, IGF, etc.\n\nSo, there you have it \u2013 cycle this and any diet for long-term, healthy fat loss.\n\nIf you want to speed up fat-loss results and have more energy at the same time, regardless of what diet you follow \u2014 try this 24+ year proven formula.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Burn Fat & Increase Metabolism Click HERE & Continue \u00bb It\u2019s 2025 and almost everyone wants to lose weight at some point in our lives.\n\nAnd if not \u201cweight\u201d, for sure a little bit of that stubborn fat\u2026 Such as belly fat or leg, butt or arm fat for women.\n\nAnd the older we get, the bigger this problem becomes\u2026 especially for women.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that statistics show that about 97% of dieters gain the weight back within 18 months1 and 71% gain back even MORE!\n\nI\u2019ve Been There, Done That!\n\nOver the past 3 decades, I\u2019ve become a \u201cfat loss\u201d expert because I\u2019ve had professional athletes and celebrities as clients who demand fast results.\n\nI\u2019ve helped hundreds of thousands of \u201ceveryday\u201d people lose the fat and KEEP it off.\n\nMost importantly, I\u2019ve personally been on some kind of a \u201cdiet\u201d since age 11, in the 6th grade.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d and have tried it all. In fact, under this article I have a special link where I reveal the \u201cbig weight loss scam\u201d and why 93% of diet and exercise programs fail.\n\nYou Should NEVER Do This!\u2026\n\nHowever, today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss the one thing you should NEVER do if you want to lose fat and keep it off and that\u2019s trying to \u201cdo it all\u201d using only ONE form of weight loss tactic.\n\nAnd by that I mean that you should NEVER try to lose weight ONLY with dieting or exercise or pills, alone. You\u2019ll end up doing MORE work and getting LESS results.\n\nThis is because your body\u2019s only purpose is the survive and it does this by ADAPTING. Your body wants \u201chomeostasis\u201d, which means that your body doesn\u2019t like change and wants to maintain equilibrium.\n\nSo here\u2019s how it works.\n\nThe Problem With DIET Only\n\nIf you try to lose weight primarily by dieting and eating less calories, your body will quickly begin to \u201cadapt\u201d2 by\n\nIncreasing your appetite, so you eat more food and stop losing weight\n\nDecreasing your metabolism, so you burn less calories and stop losing weight\n\nAt this point you\u2019ll plateau, stop seeing results and will be forced to reduce calories some more.\n\nThen the same cycle starts again and your metabolism continues slow down more and more3\u2026 To the point that you\u2019re eventually BARELY eating anything and yet, you\u2019re still not losing much weight.\n\nAnd the weight you did lose, is a lot more valuable muscle than fat. So you end up looking \u201cskinny/fat\u201d. You look older, feel tired and drained all the time.\n\nThe Problem With EXERCISE Only\n\nNow, if you try to lose weight primarily by exercising all the time, it\u2019s a lot more work because you can run for an hour and you\u2019ll end up only burning about 500 calories. That\u2019s just one slice of pizza.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot more work. It\u2019s just too easy to eat more calories than it is to burn it through exercise alone.\n\nAnd if you exercise more and more, your stress hormone \u201ccortisol\u201d goes higher and higher. This means that again, your body will lose more valuable muscle and less fat.\n\nThis will decrease your metabolism and the same end results \u2013 you\u2019re tired and start looking and feeling old!\n\nThe Problem With PILLS Only\n\nAs far as pills and supplements. Most of them do NOT work6, so it\u2019s a waste of your money.\n\nHowever, there are some very powerful and safe herbs that when mixed together5, will cause dramatic fat loss by\n\nDecreasing your appetite\n\nIncreasing your metabolism\n\nUnfortunately, your body will adapt to these as well and you can\u2019t keep taking more and more pills.\n\nAnd Now You Know Why You Can\u2019t Lose Weight.\n\nThis is a primary reason people give up eventually and gain all the weight back.\n\nWe get frustrated with the lack of results because our body adapts and progress stops.\n\nBut here\u2019s the worst part of it all\u2026\n\nWhen people stop and go back to their old ways, they gain even MORE weight because now their metabolism is ultra slow.\n\nAnd the weight they gain back is even more fat and less muscle.\n\nIt\u2019s a horrible cycle which causes frustration and aging.\n\nYour BEST Solution \u2013 It\u2019s Clinically Proven\n\nTo prevent your body from adapting or at least delay it as long as possible, it\u2019s best to do a combination of all three4.\n\nSlowly reduce your calories and start with the \u201cjunk\u201d foods\n\nAdd in a little bit of exercise daily, or at least 3-4x weekly\n\nTake specific herbs and supplements that will optimize your \u201cfat-burning hormones\u201d\n\nThis combination creates a synergy and you\u2019ll get MORE results, faster and with less effort.\n\nThis also causes LESS STRESS on your body, so you\u2019ll lose more fat than muscle.\n\nThis is how my clients actually eat MORE food and have higher energy levels\u2026 while losing mainly fat and gaining valuable muscle.\n\nThe end result is you look and feel younger.\n\nYou won\u2019t feel deprived, hungry or tired.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "We all know that we should exercise more and eat less in order to lose weight. But, how do you eat less when you\u2019re hungry all the time?\n\nThe secret is to reduce your appetite and cravings, so you don\u2019t need pure willpower to eat less.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started with my favorite, top 10 clinically proven ways to dramatically reduce your appetite and cravings.\n\nEating more protein increases feelings of fullness, lowers hunger hormones, and even causes you to eat less at your next meal.\n\nAnd quality animal proteins would be red meat (cow or bison), chicken or turkey, fish, and small amounts of whole eggs and egg whites.\n\nCarbs fill you up, decrease your appetite, feed your muscles and brain, improve thyroid function and decrease stress levels.\n\nBut eat natural carbs \u2013 fruits, vegetables, yams, legumes, and maybe a little bit of rice and oats. Stay away from processed and packaged carbs.\n\nFat is very dense in calories and tastes good. It\u2019s easy to eat a few hundred calories or more in a few minutes.\n\nGet your essential fats such as 4 grams of fish oil, a tablespoon of olive oil, and then focus the rest on protein and healthy carbs.\n\nMost supplements and ingredients do not work when it comes to weight loss and appetite control.\n\nBut, there are a few selected supplements that are clinically proven to work and do so by optimizing your neurotransmitters and hormones.\n\nDrink Only Non-Calorie Liquids\n\nDid you know one sign of hunger is being dehydrated? Yup, simply drinking more water will reduce your appetite. Especially if you have a big glass of water 20-30 minutes before a meal.\n\nFiber has a ton of health benefits \u2013 one of them being reduced appetite and feeling full, for longer.\n\nEat more fiber-rich foods \u2013 such as vegetables, fruits, and legumes. At the very least, have fiber supplements.\n\nAnd yes, there are specific fibers that actually block sugars and fats from being absorbed, while also reducing your appetite.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, your brain tells your body to reduce your appetite.\n\nBy eating slower, you\u2019ll also chew your food better and feel full, for longer.\n\nSlower eating improves hormones that interact with your digestive system, hunger, insulin levels, and so forth.\n\nHaving smaller plates, spoons, and so forth, causes you to eat less. There are plenty of studies about this, but it just logically makes sense when you think about it.\n\nExercise decreases your appetite. You\u2019d think the opposite would happen \u2013 you\u2019re exercising, you\u2019re burning more calories and you\u2019d be hungrier. But, the opposite is true.\n\nHormones play a huge role in appetite control and sleep is when the majority of your hormones are optimized.\n\nMost people don\u2019t sleep enough. A couple of nights of poor sleep will mess up your fat-burning hormones.\n\nYou need to get better sleep. Luckily, there are vitamins and herbs that are proven to help you sleep better and longer.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

Just as testosterone is produced by your testicles and estrogen by the ovaries.\n\nIn this situation, the optimal balance would be:\n\nLower cortisol levels\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be writing about each of these hormones in the future.\n\nSo, please make sure to check my blog regularly so that you don\u2019t miss the articles when they are released.\n\nFat Loss Hormones Produced By Cells\n\nThere are other hormones associated with fat loss that recently people have been speaking about, such as:\n\nAdiponectin \u2013 this burns fat & lowers blood sugar\n\nGhrelin \u2013 This stimulates hunger, increases your appetite & stores fat\n\nLeptin \u2013 this lowers cravings, makes you feel full & burns fat\n\nIn this situation, the optimal balance would be:\n\nAnd these hormones are NOT produced by glands or organs but by your cells \u2013 primarily your fat cells.\n\nSadly, the more fat cells and the higher your body fat, the more unbalanced these hormones are.\n\nThis is why the fatter you get, the harder it is to lose the fat.\n\nThus, you have even more reason to lose fat so you can stay lean and get ripped year-round.\n\nBy the way, you can actually improve all of these hormones by taking one pill that contains natural ingredients, herbs, and amino acids.\n\nYou can get all the details below at the end of the article.\n\nBut, don\u2019t go there yet\u2026\n\nFat Loss Hormones Produced By Your Gut\n\nAnd now we arrive at today\u2019s main topic \u2013 fat loss hormones produced by your gut.\n\nMore specifically, two hidden fat loss hormones that rarely any scientist or doctor speaks about and certainly not the average \u201cfitness expert\u201d and that\u2019s GLP and GIP.\n\nGLP stands for Glucagon-like Peptide GIP stands for Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Peptide\n\n\u2026. And now we will end the boring, science stuff.\n\nAll you need to know is that when these two hormones are correctly balanced, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in a minute, they can:\n\nreduce your appetite and cravings\n\ndecrease muscle breakdown, which means MORE muscle (this is important for people lifting weights, as well as just aging)\n\nImprove insulin sensitivity and help support healthy blood sugar\n\nIncrease fat burning, especially belly fat\n\nThe end result is that not only do you eat less food but the foods and calories you DO eat, get utilized for energy and muscle and tissue building, rather than fat storage.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking, \u201cYeah baby, this is awesome\u201d and it is!\n\nIt\u2019s All About Your Hormones\n\nThis is why some people eat whatever they want and don\u2019t get fat. It\u2019s genetics and hormones.\n\nFat loss isn\u2019t a simple matter of calorie math or calories in and calories out, but a rather complex interaction of hormonal biochemistry and genetics.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t change your genetics, but we CAN improve your hormones\u2026 at any age, male or female.\n\nAnd you can do this with a natural pill, which I stated earlier, and the link to that at the end of the article.\n\nHowever, you can also do it with food as well.\n\nNever Do This Addictive Combination\n\nOne of the simplest ways to accomplish this proper balance between GIP and GLP is to NOT eat a meal that\u2019s both high in carbs and fats.\n\nUnfortunately, this is what most people do and all the tasty foods have this combination.\n\nPizza, one of my favorite foods is specifically this \u2013 primarily high fat and carbs.\n\nAll snack foods \u2013 chips, donuts, pastries, and so forth \u2013 are primarily fat combined with carbs.\n\nIce cream is another one of my favorites \u2013 sugar and fat.\n\nBread and butter, or cream cheese \u2013 again, another favorite of mine \u2013 it\u2019s high fat + carbs.\n\nIn fact, the combination of sugar + fat is highly addictive to BOTH your brain and your body \u2026 And the food industry knows this and this is why so many foods have this combination.\n\nTo get you addicted to eating more, buying more, and getting fatter and this horrible cycle goes on and on.\n\nWhat you want is a meal that\u2019s primarily protein + fats \u2026 or \u2026 proteins + carbs.\n\nBut never primarily carbs + fats.\n\nFor example, you can have salmon with vegetables. That\u2019s protein + fat and small amounts of carbs.\n\nOr, you can have grass-fed bison + yams or white rice. That\u2019s mainly protein + carbs, and small amounts of fat.\n\nYes, you will still have small amounts of fat and carbs with these other meals. There\u2019s no way around it and that\u2019s fine.\n\nThe best times to eat your higher-carb meals would be before and after your workouts and before bed.\n\nFor the rest of the day, your meals should be primarily protein and fat.\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nIf you want to lose fat, get ripped, get muscular, live longer, have more energy, and look super sexy, improve your fat-burning hormones.\n\nOne important way is with your diet and that\u2019s to not eat a meal that\u2019s high in both carbs and fats.\n\nYou can also take specific natural supplements that will help accomplish this goal.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a rush and want faster and easier results, then combine the two methods \u2013 diet + a natural supplement.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal to you the \u201cFat GAIN Formula\u201d. And in a minute, you\u2019ll know how to reverse this formula to lose fat, instead of gaining it.\n\nNow, one \u201cweight loss\u201d formula that most people typically agree on, is that you need to either eat fewer calories or burn more calories to lose fat.\n\nThus, creating a calorie deficit, which will eventually lead to weight loss.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t always true and it\u2019s not so \u201csimple\u201d.\n\nFor example, when you\u2019re sleep deprived or chronically stressed \u2013 you\u2019ll get fatter, even if you don\u2019t eat more calories.\n\nAnd women deal with this every month because of their menstrual cycles. You\u2019ll gain and lose weight and it\u2019s not just water weight. Your cravings, mood, and metabolism all change.\n\nAnd no, it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with \u201cwillpower\u201d either. And I say this because one too many times I\u2019ve heard someone say something rude about how fat or overweight people are \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cgluttonous\u201d.\n\nNot only is this insulting, but it\u2019s also not true.\n\nThe REAL Cause Of Weight Gain\n\nSo what\u2019s the cause of weight gain, especially when you aren\u2019t eating more calories?\u2026\n\nWell, genetics aside \u2014 it\u2019s your hormones.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve read my articles or know anything about me, you\u2019ve read me say that the way you act, look, and feel IS dictated by your genetics. Additionally, your hormones can turn ON or OFF your genetics\u2026\n\nAnd, your lifestyle \u2014 diet, exercise, stress management, supplements, etc. \u2014 affects your hormones.\n\nThus, you DO have some control over your genetics, or which genetics get \u201cexpressed\u201d.\n\nSo, \u201cfat gain\u201d and \u201cweight loss\u201d can be complex and it\u2019s not as simple as \u201ceat less and exercise more\u201d. It involves understanding individual genetics, unique metabolic expressions, psychological sensitivities, and even personal preferences.\n\nHowever, there does appear to be a common theme and this is where the Fat Gain Formula comes in. And here it is: (F + S) x ST = Fat Gain\n\nHigh fat (F) along with high sugar/carbs (S) combined with stress (ST), is the recipe for fat gain.\n\nA high fat + high sugar combination has been shown in mammals to completely disrupt the normal metabolic regulation that occurs\u2026 more so than either high fat or high sugar diets.\n\nThus, COMBINATION is much worse and it\u2019s the real problem.\n\nIt changes hormones & peptides.\n\nIt increases cravings for more high-fat, high-sugar foods.\n\nIt alters brain chemistry in a way that disrupts the natural ability to self-regulate calorie intake.\n\nIt increases hunger and basically sabotages willpower.\n\nNow, there\u2019s been studies done on this with rats and humans \u2013 the same outcome every time. So, I won\u2019t bore you with the science jargon.\n\nSo, I covered the first part of the formula for, Fats (F) + Sugars (S). What about the Stress (ST) part of the formula?\u2026 (F + S) x ST = Fat Gain\n\nWell, when you\u2019re under stress \u2013 physical and/or emotional \u2013 your body starts producing various hormones and chemicals, such as cortisol, catecholamines, and NPY.\n\nAgain, I won\u2019t bore you with the science jargon.\n\nJust know that when you add stress into the formula, it\u2019s like adding gasoline to the fire \u2014 the fat-gaining effects are multiplied and greatly intensified.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Solution?\n\nWell, we can\u2019t always control stress. However, you can manage how you DEAL with stress, that\u2019s something I think we all need to work on more.\n\nAs for the Fat + Sugar part\u2026 You need to NOT mix these two types of foods in the same meal.\n\nThus, you should eat meals consisting of a combination of:\n\nProtein + Fats (little or no carbs/sugars) \u2014 This might be a chicken salad with greens and avocado or olive oil Proteins + Carbs (little or no fat) \u2014 This might be chicken with white rice or yams and broccoli\n\nBut do NOT combine \u201cfats + carbs\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, all the good-tasting foods are \u201cfats + carbs\u201d\u2026 pastries, chips, donuts, pizza, french fries, ice cream, hamburgers, so on and so forth.\n\nThese types of foods and processed foods that come in a \u201cbox\u201d are designed to increase your cravings. Unfortunately, they also screw up your hormones causing you to gain weight.\n\nSo it\u2019s not about calories, but the TYPE of calories and COMBINATION.\n\nNow, we can\u2019t always eat like this, especially when going out to restaurants, parties, family events, holidays, and so forth.\n\nYou want to enjoy yourself and the party and that also includes enjoying some of the yummy foods \u2013 the \u201cFats + Sugars\u201d foods.\n\nIn these situations, go ahead and indulge a little bit and have fun. Then make sure you\u2019re back to your healthy diet the next day.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re the type of person that eats out often, or is social and still wants to enjoy these types of foods, you CAN take some \u201cfat + sugar\u201d blocking herbs.\n\nYes, such a supplement exists. Yes, it really works. Yes, you can still enjoy some of your favorite foods and NOT feel guilty.\n\nThus, you can finally \u201chave your cake and eat it too\u201d.\n\nOf course, only in moderation.\n\nBut you can get all the details about this, in my next article. Click on this link and discover the \u201cFat + Sugar\u201d BLOCKING Formula.\n\nImportant \"Carb, Sugar & Fat BLOCKING\" Shortcut\n\nOne of the biggest problems with \"dieting\" is the fact you can't eat some of your favorite foods.\n\nThis is especially difficult when you go out - such as restaurants, parties, the holidays, date-night and other social events.\n\nHowever, the great news is that there's a special way that you can actually BLOCK those \"bad\" calories (sugars, carbs and fats) from your favorite foods from being absorbed.\n\nThe end result is \"you can have your cake and eat it too\"... And STILL lose weight! It's utilizing ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss-se/pros-and-cons-of-diet-soda/",
    "content": "Diet soda is a multi-billion dollar business around the world. The promise of diet soda is that it will provide all the taste of regular soda without the processed sugar which promotes weight gain. However, while many diet sodas have little to no calories and do not possess any processed sugar, they are associated with some health issues if too much is consumed on a daily basis.\n\nThe Advantages of Diet Soda\n\nNo Processed Sugar: Because processed sugar is one of the primary ways people gain weight and excess fat, the lack of it in diet sodas means fewer ways for people to add the pounds. This is certainly one of the biggest reasons why people choose diet soda and the artificial sweeteners help make the product taste good.\n\nFew to No Calories: Because there are so few calories in diet soda, you are certainly not adding unnecessary calories to your diet. In fact, consuming 0 to 10 calories that most diet sodas have will have no direct impact on your weight and theoretically should help subtract from your current weight even if you make no other changes to your diet.\n\nPositive Hydration: Diet sodas are an excellent source of hydration if you like your water to have taste. In fact, many people prefer them to plain water and while the taste may not quite be as good as standard sodas, they do not have the disadvantages of drinking processed sugar.\n\nThe Disadvantages of Diet Soda\n\nNo Nutritional Benefit: Put simply, you are not gaining any nutritional benefits from consuming diet sodas apart from the hydration. This means that low calorie fruit juices may arguably be a better source if you do not like consuming water.\n\nIncreased Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: While the research on heart attack and strokes have proven so far to be inconclusive. There are studies which show an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes from drinking large amounts of diet soda. Considering that diet sodas do not contain sugar this is a surprising result, but one that is being verified by other studies.\n\nIncreased Risk of Weight Gain: In one of the most surprising findings, diet soda is now actually being linked to weight gain. Long term studies have shown that people who consume diet sodas were actually more likely to be heavier and even gain weight. This is probably due to the artificial sweeteners which actually confuses the body\u2019s ability to manage calories because people taste sweetness in the diet soda. The result is that people tend to eat more sweet foods and actually gain weight.\n\nOverall, diet sodas should be consumed in moderation so that their effects on weight gain and developing diabetes can be minimized. Mixing your consumption of diet sodas with fruit drinks and regular water will help in keeping the negative effects to a minimum.\n\nFor many, diet sodas are a daily drink that many people consume too much which may be contributing to the very conditions that they had hoped to avoid when switching away from regular sodas. Be sure to moderate your consumption of diet soda so you can enjoy the taste while not suffering from the negative effects.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "The HCG Diet has certainly gained favor in recent years for promising to help a person lose weight at an amazing rate. However, is this the right diet for you and does it really deliver on its promises?\n\nHuman Chorionic Gonadotropin is a hormone that is actually found in the human body. It is produced by the pituitary gland and can be found in the urine of pregnant women. Also, there are certain tumors that product HCG as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s special about HCG is that the hormone allows the body to better access the fat at a faster rate than normal, especially while eating a low calorie diet. This means that instead of burning bone mass or muscle tissue, you actually burn away the fast instead.\n\nThe theory behind the diet program is to drastically cut down on the calories to help force your body to tap the fat cells for energy thanks to taking injections of HCG. Since increasing HCG in your system will reduce your appetite levels.\n\nThe diet promises to help you lose up to a pound or more a day as long as you are on the diet. The combination of calorie restriction and the HCG hormone is designed to facilitate the weight loss in a manner that is very quick and promises to burn away the fat as well.\n\nThe Pros of the HCG Diet\n\nFor certain people, especially those who only need to lose a few pounds then this crash diet just might work. Plus, the diet can be taken in pill or drop form instead of having the injections which means less pain.\n\nThe Cons of the HCG Diet\n\nThis particular type of diet is not approved by FDA and they warn of the health risks associated with this diet program. Because of the calorie restrictions which at 500 is very severe, the potential health risks are considerable with this particular program. The HCG hormone itself seems to have very little, if any effect since the calorie restriction alone will cause you to lose weight in an unhealthy manner.\n\nIn addition, there is not exercise regimen associated with the diet which would help build up muscle tissue. Plus, there are no long term studies that fully understand just what this diet could do to your body over time. There are also major health risks associated with this type of diet that makes it unsuitable for most people.\n\nThe promise of losing up to a pound or more per day can only be done if you lose fluids as fat simply cannot be burned away that quickly. This means that rebounding from the diet is a real possibility which removes it from consideration as a long range plan to deal with weight loss.\n\nBasically, the HCG diet offers a lot of promise but the truth is that for most people it has failed to deliver. For those who are really interested in losing weight, this is just not the program that will do it and in fact should be avoided because of the potential health risk.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Almost like clockwork right after the holiday season you can count on a number of fad diets to hit the airwaves. Some are in the form of special exercises while others are mostly about a new diet product. But whatever it is, they all promise the same thing.\n\nFad diets are as sure as the coming spring which is what they promise you\u2019ll be slim and trim for when it happens. These diets come in all shapes and sizes, but they all promise to reduce your shape considerably.\n\nThe easiest way to describe a fad diet is that it is the \u201clatest thing\u201d. In other words, this is the hottest diet that more people are going on at the moment. It might be low-carb, no grains, low-fat or some other type of \u201clow\u201d or \u201cno\u201d system that is designed to help you shed the excess fat quickly and easily.\n\nFad diets are quite numerous, but they mostly die a quick death once summer has arrived. By the following year just after New Year\u2019s Day you can count on another round of diets promising to be the end-all, be-all that will get rid of that excess flab.\n\nThe Pros of a Fad Diet\n\nThe truth is that some fad diets actually incorporate good, healthy eating principles that may actually work. In many cases, the people that have actually succeeded in losing weight are the ones who stuck to the good principles of the diet and made them part of their eating habits.\n\nAnother plus is that fad diets do help some people jump start to a healthier way of living. In essence, it is the indirect approach where someone sees a fad diet and does not jump on the bandwagon, but instead decides to eat healthier and exercise to lose the weight.\n\nThe Cons of a Fad Diet\n\nMost fad diets are simply too restrictive for people to follow for very long. Starting with the second or third week there is some cheating followed by a complete collapse as the diet itself simply does not allow enough food for a person to eat and still be comfortable. A rigid menu is a sure sign that the diet program will not work for very long.\n\nThe key problem is that it took time for you to gain the weight, so it will take time for you to lose the weight. A \u201cquick start\u201d program that helps you lose weight fast usually means water weight that will quickly come back once you start eating normally again.\n\nIt takes time, effort and commitment to lose the excess weight and keep it off. This means that you will need to eat healthy and exercise so that you can build up the muscle tissues that will help burn away the fat.\n\nFad diets are simply designed to fail because they are all about short term strategies that simply do not work in the long run. However, fad diets do serve the purpose of alerting and motivating us to lose the weight properly if we eat healthier and exercise.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Lauki juice, which comes from the bottle gourd, has long been part of traditional Indian cuisine. The rest of the world is beginning to enjoy what this waxy green vegetable can provide when juiced, however, because it is believed to provide a number of health benefits. It is a water vegetable, composed of 96% water, so it is perfect for juicing. It\u2019s also rich in Vitamin B and C, as well as iron and potassium.\n\nThat\u2019s just the start of the benefits that come with each glass of Lauki juice. It also promotes weight loss by curbing your appetite! Supplement the juice with some slices of fresh Lauki and you\u2019ll have an amazing weight loss journey. You\u2019ll also get to experience these additional 7 benefits.\n\n1. Digestion Regulation.\n\nLauki juice helps to create more internal regularity because of its high moisture and fiber content. It treats constipation very effectively with the added fiber and it reduces the bloated feeling that can come when you eat too many fruits or vegetables at one time.\n\nLauki juice also provides a cooling relief when your body is overheated. It\u2019s not just able to replenish hydration that is lost from sweat.

If you mix Lauki juice with cranberries, you\u2019ll be able to flush the bacteria out quickly that are causing the UTI. It generally takes 48-72 hours to find relief. A teaspoon of lime juice is nice to add as well.\n\n4. It Creates Deeper Sleep\n\nLauki juice has been known to help with chronic insomnia.

It Helps the Heart\n\nLauki juice also helps to regulate blood pressure, which can then reduce the chances of heart disease and other stress related elements over time. All it takes is one glass of juice in the morning to experience the benefits for the remainder of the day.\n\n7. It Reduces Inflammation\n\nWhether you\u2019ve had an injury or your liver is just tired of processing the alcohol you\u2019ve been giving it, the inflammation properties of Lauki juice are outstanding. If you drink 3 glasses of juice throughout the day, you can keep unwanted swelling at bay, feel better, and even have more energy to get through the toughest of days.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "When it comes to effective weight loss, there are a number of products on the market today that promise to help people lose the unwanted pounds and inches. Most of these products are taken internally to boost the metabolism, burn away the fat, prevent the body from absorbing as much fat and so forth.\n\nHowever, there are a special set of weight loss products that are used as a temporary tool to burn away the excess weight. Albolene is one such product, a topical cream that is applied to the areas of the body where there is excess water weight built up that needs to be reduced on a temporary basis. Albolene has been used by bodybuilders, athletes and others to present a better overall appearance.\n\nAlbolene is a topical cream that is designed to trap body heat where it is applies so that it in turn creates more perspiration. For example, when albolene is applied to the thighs, buttocks and torso areas, the cream will trap more of the heat that emanates from those particular locations which in turns causes the body to perspire at a higher rate.\n\nMore perspiration means that any excess water that was held by the fat cells and underlying tissues are perspired away which provides the appearance of a thinner, healthier looking body. It must be noted that this is a temporary effect as once the cream is removed or worn away over time these particular areas will once again put back on the excess water weight.\n\nThe Benefits of Using Albolene\n\nThe primary use of albolene is to reduce the excess water weight in a particular location of the body. In essence, it does not actually reduce the fat, only the water that is present. This means that it is not a diet supplement nor does it cause any permanent weight loss. Instead, it creates a better appearance that is used by bodybuilders and others who want to lose a few pounds around their waist, thighs and buttocks.\n\nFor what it is designed to do, albolene is quite effective. The additional heat is quite effective in helping the body to perspire in the areas where it is applied to create a thinner appearance. For many people, albolene is an effective, albeit temporary solution to what they want to achieve.\n\nThe Issues associated with Albolene\n\nIt must be noted that when albolene is used as directed, it offers a temporary reduction of inches and few unwanted side effects. However, it is not a weight loss product in the sense that it does not actually burn away the fat, only the excess water from the body.\n\nWhen used in excessive amounts, albolene can be a threat to the health of the body as it drains too much in terms of water weight. This can leave a person vulnerable to dehydration and create a dangerous condition in the body.\n\nHowever, when used as directed and for the purpose of temporarily losing a few extra pounds of water weight in the right places, albolene is a helpful product that produces a slimmer looking figure even if it is only temporary.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss-se/using-lipotropic-b12-injections-for-weight-loss/",
    "content": "There is no doubt that taking the required amount of vitamins each day will help the body function properly. However, there has been a recent movement in terms of Vitamin B12 in that supposedly helps the body lose excess fat. Today, there are a growing number of people who are now taking B12 injections to help the body burn away the excess fat.\n\nThere is no doubt that a connection exists between B12 and the use of excess fat in the body, but does taking injections of lipotropic B12 really result in weight loss? Moreover, if it does work is it worth the effort and financial commitment to lose excess fat in this fashion.\n\nHow Lipotropic B12 Works to Control Weight\n\nB12 is a very important vitamin that is part of the healthy functioning of the body. Its particular role is to help with the proper metabolism of the cells, the formation of blood and bolstering the central nervous system. For those who have difficulty absorbing B12 through normal sources, adding them into the diet through supplements is a common way to ensure they get what they need.\n\nHowever, when adding lipotropic elements to the B12 it helps to shift the emphasis more towards the burning of the fat cells. Basically, the lipotropic compounds are three amino acids that are geared towards helping the body shed the excess fat. While taking them orally is effective, direct injections means it bypasses the digestive system and will have a greater impact overall.\n\nWhat Happens when Not Enough B12 is Present in the Body\n\nEssentially, when the body does not have enough sources of B12, it can compromise the replication of DNA and RNA. When these elements are compromised, that may lead to a greater chance that cancer cells are formed. In addition, not having enough B12 will lead to a concentration of homocysteine in the body which is an amino acid that may lead to more heart attacks and strokes to occur.\n\nIn addition, a lack of B12 means that blood does not carry all the oxygen it should to the organs and tissues in the by which means a general lack of energy and feelings of being sluggish. This is especially true for those over 60 who often have trouble absorbing enough B12 from their food to feel energetic. Now, when combined with lipotropic amino acids the effect is such that the body tends to burn away more fat.\n\nDoes Lipotropic B12 Really Work?\n\nIt is a difficult question to answer because the effect of having B12 in the body is one that provides more natural energy. With more energy, the greater the ability to exercise and be more mobile which in turn adds to the weight loss. Adding in the proper amino acids with a direct injection is an obvious attempt to jump starts the body to help it burn away more fat.\n\nHowever, studies by the Mayo Clinic have not shown that this particular effort really works. In fact, it appears that taking B12 orally or through injections offers the same results. For those who are interested in shedding the extra pounds, having enough B12 and amino acids in the body is important for maximum efficiency. But there is no solid evidence to show that it actually burns away the fat on its own.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Weight loss is all about burning calories. If you reduce the amount of calories your body needs to store every day, then you\u2019re going to be able to start losing weight over time. It takes 3,500 calories per week to get burned off or cut out just to lose one pound, so any activity is going to be helpful. What some are choosing to do is to use a hula hoop to begin losing weight.\n\nHow effective is hula hooping for weight loss? Let\u2019s take a look how effective it could be for you.\n\nImagine Losing More Weight Than Jogging\u2026\n\nFirst of all, you\u2019re going to need a weight loss hula hoop to ultimately be successful. The toy hoops will work in a pinch, but they won\u2019t burn off the same amount of calories as the heavier workout versions will. They heavier ones are also easier to keep up in the air as you gyrate your hips back and forth. When someone gives it their all, they\u2019ll be able to burn up to 100 calories every 10 minutes, which is often better than jogging can provide.\n\nUsing a hula hoop for weight loss does more than just help you from a cardiovascular standpoint. Because you need to use your core muscles in order to keep the hoop up in the air, you\u2019ll be working out your ab muscles, including your obliques, consistently. The position that you stand in requires you to place weight on your thigh muscles as well, which helps to tone them up for you as well.\n\nBest of all, the exercise is low impact, so it isn\u2019t going to hurt your joints as you get your workout done. All you do is find enough space, slip on the hoop, and start going crazy.\n\nHow Can You Make Sure You\u2019re Hula Hooping in the Right Way?\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to lose weight or maintain your current weight through hula hooping, then it is important to stabilize your torso and legs. It is your midsection that will need to move and it is important to remember that only your ab muscles will be causing the hoop to rotate.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to scoop up that midsection as best as you can. Lift those core muscles up toward your ribcage and extend from your center on out. Keep your shoulders back as best you can and keep an upright position. With better posture, it is easier to keep your hoop up in the air. Hold the hoop to the floor in a parallel fashion as you start to spin. More speed at the beginning that you add with your arms will prevent wobbling.\n\nMost importantly, you\u2019ve got to stick with the practice of hula hooping in order for it to be effective. You might not experience a lot of benefits at first because you\u2019re struggling to keep the hoop up. That\u2019s ok. With more practice, your body gets used to the motions and the posture that are required, which ultimately means you\u2019ll be able to start losing more weight with this effective exercise.\n\nHula hooping is effective for weight loss when it is done correctly. Consider this exercise as an option for your next workout routine and you might just be amazed at the results you can achieve.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

This type of water has a higher pH level than standard water, so it is believed that it can give people more energy and even relieve certain illnesses or diseases. Alkaline water can be created from standard tap water with purifiers and filters that are available. Is consuming this drink something that could be beneficial to you? Decide on your own by checking out these pros and cons.\n\nThe Pros of Alkaline Water\n\n1. It May Encourage Easier Absorption Of Water Into The Body There are researchers who believe that alkaline water has the ability to be better absorbed by the cells of the body because of its higher pH levels. This allows the body to better flush out the different toxins that can build up in the various cells that people have and attain higher overall levels of hydration that can be sustained for longer periods of time.\n\n2. It Has A Higher Mineral Content The pH levels of alkaline water are higher because there is more overall mineral content in the water. As the cells absorb these minerals, it is able to provide the body with the nutrients it needs to stay healthy with less overall effort.\n\n3. Alkaline Environments Make It Impossible For Illnesses To Thrive A body that is in an alkaline state is naturally resistant to many different types of disease. By balancing out the total pH of the body with this fluid, some believe that the risk of having any disease can be prevented. Some have even claimed that cancer cannot exist in a body that is truly alkaline.\n\nThe Cons of Alkaline Water\n\n1. It Can Be Quite Expensive Special filters are needed to create the alkalinity levels in the water, so the costs of create alkaline water are tremendously high when compared to other waters. Products can come in drop from so that any water can become more alkaline, but when tap water is essentially free and alkaline water modifications are not, the costs can begin to add up.\n\n2. There\u2019s No Actual Evidence Official research has not been able to determine the validity of claims that alkaline water can be beneficial. It\u2019s a natural remedy that many people swear will work, but there is no independent proof of any of these claims.\n\n3. It May Unbalance The Human Body The whole purpose of drinking alkaline water is to balance the body, but anything that is consumed in excess will actually create more disharmony than balance. If too much alkaline water is consumed, there is the potential that more harm could be achieved than good.\n\nAlkaline water may help some people feel better every day. It may not help others in any way. Because of its expense and lack of tangible evidence, it is important to weigh all of the pros and cons of alkaline water before investing into it. These examples are just the beginning of the research you will want to do.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "It seems at the beginning of every year millions of people go on diets to lose that extra weight they packed on during the holidays. It also seems that every year there are new fad diets that are being offered as well which promise to shed the weight quickly and easily. The fad diet can rightfully be called an institution, especially in America where there seems to be an entire industry built around the idea that excess fat can be lost quickly and safely just for the price of the program.\n\nWhat is the Fad Diet?\n\nA fad diet does not describe the actual diet per say, but instead describes its popularity among the public. When a new diet program is introduced and gains recognition, it will almost always fade after a time in terms of its status. Thus the term \u201cfad\u201d diet to describe how it was once so popular, but now it is rather pass\u00e9.\n\nThere have been many different types of fad diets in terms of how they address losing weight, but practically all of them are built on the idea of losing excess fat very quickly, allowing someone to slim down in just a few months so that they can be ready for the summer. Generally speaking, they are not designed as a permanent eating plan, just one that will shed the fat until the person is ready to go back on a normal eating routine.\n\nThe Pros of Fad Diets\n\nDespite their short-lived nature and general reputation, there are some advantages to fad diets in which a certain section of the population may very well benefit.\n\nFast Weight Loss: When following directions, most fad diets will help you to lose weight especially early on. For those who are an extra few pounds overweight, this can be a simple, quick way to lose the excess fat.\n\nFocus on the Body: If anything, fad diets help people focus on their own health and well being even if the diet itself is not successful. For many, the failure of the fad diet causes them to reconsider their eating habits and change to a healthier eating lifestyle.\n\nThe Cons of Fad Diets\n\nDespite the fact that most fad diets will actually help people to lose weight, there are some significant issues with how they work.\n\nWater Weight: Most of the weight lost through fad diets is water weight and not body fat. This means that you will gain the weight back quickly after you switch back to a normal eating routine.\n\nThe Yo-Yo Cycle: Engaging in different fad diets over the years causes the body to \u201cyo-yo\u201d in weight which may be more dangerous to the health than simply being overweight. The strain put on the body from losing and gaining a significant amount of weight every year can be considerable.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you only need to lose five to ten pounds, then selecting a fad diet may be a good choice. However, if you have more weight to lose, then you should avoid fad diets and instead stick to a healthy eating plan that you can live with for the rest of your life.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Over the past decade, many people have proclaimed the benefits of coconut oil for many uses, particularly in food products as it provides many healthy ingredients. However, despite being an excellent natural product that has a great deal of uses, it is not without its disadvantages.\n\nWhat follows are the pros and cons of coconut oil so that you can make the best informed decision about how to use this product in your daily life.\n\nThe Pros of Coconut Oil\n\n1. Antioxidants Antioxidants fight the free radicals in the body that causes premature aging in the skin, hair, and nails as well as the rest of the body. Consuming plenty of antioxidants will help you look younger and may even protect the body from certain types of cancer as well.\n\n2. Helpful Fatty Acids Some studies suggest that coconut oil has some excellent short and medium chain fatty acids that may provide good health benefits for the heart and circulatory system when taken in moderation. However, more research is needed to confirm if this is really true.\n\n3. Overall Healthy Effects While arguably not the most nutritious substance. There are enough healthy factors in coconut oil that it can be used in moderation in the body. However, this is true of many natural oils such as extra virgin olive oil which has many healthy benefits. The key however is moderation as taking in too much may have detrimental effects as well.\n\nThe Cons of Coconut Oil\n\nDespite being a natural product and an excellent skin and hair oil that is used by women around the world, coconut oil has some definite shortcomings as a product that is to be consumed.\n\n1. Saturated Fat The amount of saturated fat in coconut oil is higher than butter and is considered a solid fat as well. Considering that there are no proteins or carbohydrates and just a few nutrients, coconut oil offers the body very little that it can use. Plus, the consumption of saturated fat will increase the risk of heart disease.\n\n2. LDL Cholesterol Studies have shown that coconut oil raises the LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol in the body thanks mostly to the saturated fats. For those who run the risk of heart disease, coconut oil is something to be avoided if at all possible.\n\n3. Expense Despite its widespread availability, coconut oils roughly twice as expensive as olive oil and does not have nearly the benefits. While extra virgin olive oil has many benefits to the body, coconut oil has very few and in most cases may only be consumed in small amounts in order to avoid causing negative effects to the body.\n\nOverall, coconut oil is actually one of the worst of the plant-based oils that you can consume considering the very high amount of saturated fat and low nutritional value. However, as a product that is used externally on the hair and skin, coconut oil has proven to be of great value and is considered a very good product when used in that manner.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss-se/high-protein-diet-pros-and-cons/",
    "content": "Of the many diets that have been popular in recent year, the emphasis on high proteins is one that has attracted many people for good reasons. Proteins are used by the body to build muscle tissue and does not cause the body to generate fat like sugars or carbohydrates. However, despite all the positives that proteins bring there are some negative factors as well.\n\nStill, there are many diets which emphasize proteins such as the Paleo version which is quite popular. For those who want to lose weight fast, there are a number of reasons why you should look at going on a high protein diet.\n\nThe Pros of a High Protein Diet\n\nFast Weight Loss: Studies have demonstrated that people who go on a high protein diet tend to lose the excess fat quite fast. This is because of the lack of sugars and carbohydrates which normally get turned into fat if the energy is not used and because protein protects the muscles which means the body has to go to other sources for energy and the stored fat is one of them.\n\nMotivation: One of the reasons why many diets fail is because when dieters do not see quick results they tend to give up. However, given the fast weight loss that accompanies most high protein diets they see the results very quickly which is an excellent motivator.\n\nLower Cholesterol: While this is more a side effect of losing the weight rather that the direct consumption of proteins, the speed in which the weight is lost means that those who have dangerous levels of cholesterol can get relief rather quickly by using this particular diet.\n\nBetter Hunger Satiation: Proteins take longer to digest than carbohydrates or fats so they remain in the stomach longer and help the person feel fuller and more satisfied for longer periods of time. For those tend to gorge on food, having more proteins can help curb this tendency.\n\nThe Cons of a High Protein Diet\n\nLDL Cholesterol Eventually Increases: While there is an initial drop of LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol initially because of the weight loss, it quickly returns because of the emphasis on protein-laden foods such as meats which tend to push the cholesterol back upwards again.\n\nHigh Saturated Fats: Many foods that have lots of protein are also loaded with saturated fats as well. This can lead to a very unhealthy situation especially when combined with the raising of the LDL cholesterol as well.\n\nHeadaches & Irritability: When the body is denied having enough carbohydrates for energy it goes into a state of ketosis which not only causes the rapid weight loss, but also can create headaches and irritability which makes being on the diet miserable for some.\n\nThe end result is that going on a high protein diet is one of the best ways to lose five to ten pounds very quickly. However, for longer term diets it is best to augment the increase of proteins with other foods such as fruits and vegetables to help avoid some of the drawbacks that this type of dieting brings.\n\nFurthermore, there are great sources of proteins such as lean meats and legumes or beans that offer the amount of protein needed without the risk of raising LDL cholesterol levels or consuming too much saturated fat.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "A junk food tax is designed to make unhealthy foods more expensive to purchase which in turn is suppose to decrease the growing obesity rate in the country. Plus, the proceeds from the tax would generally be used to promote healthy foods leading to a \u201cwin-win\u201d according to its proponents. However, there is a great deal of controversy with this type of tax and there are substantive arguments on both sides of the issue.\n\nIn general, the tax would be much like that on cigarettes or alcohol which enjoys great popularity, but such \u201csin\u201d taxes may be more for show than actual effect.\n\nPros of Junk Food Tax\n\nDecrease Consumption Rates: The best argument for a junk food tax is that would make people pay a cost for eating unhealthy foods. Rather than being lectured about the issues with unhealthy foods, the tax would act as a more passive means of discouraging their purchase. In addition, the money from the tax would be used to fight the effects of obesity which has been estimated to cost in the billions in terms of health care.\n\nGreater Risk of Obesity: Obesity causes a greater risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke and angina of which a junk food tax would help pay to offset in terms of the financial burdens. This includes the treatment, lost earning and even employment factors as those who are obese are roughly 25% less likely to be hired. While such a tax cannot pay for all of these costs, they can be used to help discourage people from becoming obese and encourage the consumption of health-friendly foods.\n\nEncourages Healthier Eating: Encouraging a healthier diet is at the core of the junk food tax and will also act to help food producers create a larger supply of foods that are lower in sugar and fat. Also, fast food outlets would be encouraged to provide healthier items on their menu as well. The revenues that are raised can be used for a number of purposes, but overall it does mean more money to address the issues of obesity in the country.\n\nWhen combined with other taxes, this form of taxation could avoid being regressive and impacting lower income families disproportionally as some critics have seen it.\n\nCons of Junk Food Tax\n\nDespite the many advantages that are listed, there are some serious issues associated with installing a junk food or \u201cfat\u201d tax on the public.\n\nApplication: Arguably the most controversial aspect is which foods will be taxed. For example, many cheeses are high in fat, yet such foods are not usually considered as \u201cjunk food\u201d despite their effects on obesity. Plus, consuming too many foods no matter how healthy they are will contribute to the obesity rate. So, there would be controversy over the application of the tax.\n\nOverestimate the Cost of Obesity: The estimates to how much obesity actually costs in terms of health care is subject to debate. Many people believe that other factors contribute to the health of an individual which means that being obese is not necessarily the only factor to consider.\n\nThere will be controversy on any junk food tax so the application of it will depend on a number of factors, including the size of the tax, what it covers and the communities that decide to enforce it.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "When it comes to liposuction, it has certainly revolutionized the medical field thanks to it being minimally invasive and comparatively safe in terms of removing excess fat. While traditional liposuction techniques pull or vacuum the fat out of the body, the laser liposuction method melts away the fat which is then drained from the body.\n\nThere are different types of lasers which are used in the procedure, but they all have relatively the same effect. It is important to understand all the advantages and disadvantages of the procedure before you make your decision. This is why consulting with your doctor is very important as all the health factors and risks can be taken into account.\n\nThe Pros of Laser Liposuction\n\nSmaller Cannulas: The cannulas is the instrument inserted into the body to remove the fat. The cannulas is smaller in laser liposuction units that traditional ones which means that the incision point will be smaller and less intrusive in the body.\n\nNo Scraping: Instead of the traditional scraping method which can leave muscles sore and cause a considerable amount of pain and swelling, the laser actually melts the fat away which is less painful.\n\nCollagen Production: This form of liposuction actually encourages the production of collagen in the skin so that it shrinks back normally. Traditional methods of liposuction did not always do that which meant that in some cases the skin didn\u2019t shrink after the fat was removed.\n\nLocal Anesthesia: This is far safer than using general anesthesia which in some patients may create complications. By using a local anesthesia, the patient can go home quickly and have minimal trauma caused by the procedure itself.\n\nLittle Scarring: Because sutures are not essential to the procedure, scarring is virtually invisible.\n\nThe Cons of Laser Liposuction\n\nHowever, despite all the advantages there are certain issues with laser liposuction that will need to be fully discussed with your physician.\n\nExpensive: Being relatively new, this procedure is still fairly expensive so it will only be available to those with the money to have it performed.\n\nInfection: There is always a slight chance of infection even when using the laser system. While not a large chance, it is still one that will need to be taken into account.\n\nUneven Results: If not performed correctly, you may wind up with some lumpiness in the fat that remains which results in an uneven and unnatural look. Aditionally, if you gain weight again you may need to repeat the liposuction process. However, you will not have to do so in the same area as the previous fat that has been removed. You will want to consult with your physician to see if this form of liposuction is right for you. Be sure to compare all the pros and cons, plus look at your own situation as this form of weight loss is generally not designed to remove large amounts of fat from the body.\n\nAll in all, laser liposuction is generally best for those who have small areas of stubborn fat that remains unaffected by traditional weight loss means.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Around the world there are millions of people who are overweight and some who are morbidly obese. For those people in particular, the option that a surgical procedure can help rectify their condition is certainly an attractive option.\n\nGastric bypass surgery has become quite popular in recent years thanks to the dramatic effects that it has had on the people who have undergone the procedure. It is a radical form of treatment that has caused thousands of people to shed their excess fat. However, it is not without complications and before a person goes ahead with the surgery, it is important to know what it is, what it does and the advantages as well as disadvantages that are present.\n\nWhat is Gastric Bypass Surgery?\n\nThis is a form of surgery that is fairly straightforward in nature. The stomach is reduced to the point where it can only hold a fraction of the food it once did. Because the stomach is restricted, the amount of food is greatly reduced and the person begins to shed the excess fat. The most common type of surgery is called the Roux-en-Y and uses relatively tiny incisions to \u201cstaple\u201d the stomach so that its volume is reduced significantly.\n\nThe Pros of Gastric Bypass Surgery\n\nThere are a number of advantages to this type of surgery as it is fairly quick and the patient can start eating solid foods within a short time frame.\n\nEffective: Studies have shown that people who have this type of surgery drop the excess weight very quickly and will continue to lose the weight for up to two years afterwards as well. In addition, up to 70% of the people who have this type of surgery will keep the weight off for as long as 10 years, if not longer. This makes it one of the most effective forms of weight loss around.\n\nImproved Health: The long term loss of the weight means that the health complications associated with obesity such as diabetes, high blood pressure and sleep apnea to name a few are greatly reduced. The overall improvement in their health is dramatic when followed up with exercise and eating healthy.\n\nThe Cons of Gastric Bypass Surgery\n\nDespite all the advantages, there are certain risks to this form of surgery both in terms of the procedure and the effects it will have on the body.\n\nPermanent Changes: Basically, your diet and lifestyle will undergo a permanent change in terms of the foods that can be eaten. Without vitamin and mineral supplements, your body may become malnourished and suffer from the effects of anemia, low energy and run the risk of a lowered immune system as well.\n\nDumping Syndrome: This is a symptom caused when the person consumes foods high in sugar content that are simply passed through the stomach and they may experience nausea, acid reflux or diarrhea.\n\nAlthough the method is straightforward, gastric bypass is still major surgery and there may be risks and complications. So, it is very important that you talk with your doctor before undergoing this procedure. There are other, non-surgical choices out there which may be better for your particular condition.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "It may seem rather odd given all the reports and articles about the benefits of going organic that there are negative aspects to purchasing natural food. After all, until recently all the meat, fruits and vegetables that were available would be considered \u201corganic\u201d in nature.\n\nHowever, despite all the negative connotations, there are benefits to the artificially boosted food that we consume. Plus, the increased yields have allowed for farmers to produce more crops on the same amount of land as compared to fifty years ago. Given that, going organic does have its advantages that its many advocates will point out.\n\nWhat Are the Pros of Organic Food?\n\nEnvironmentally Friendly: There is no doubt that arguably the best advantage the organic foods offer is how friendly they are to the environment. When visiting an organic farm, you will notice the diversity of plants beyond just the organic foods and the animals as well which makes up the eco-system of this type of farming.\n\nNo Hydrogenated Fat: Arguably one of the biggest health issues is the hydrogenated fat that is developed in animals that are part of current non-organic farming techniques. This type of fat has been linked to heart disease and other cardiovascular issues. Organic foods do not contain this type of fat and they are healthier for your heart and body.\n\nFewer Pesticides: It must be noted that organic foods are not necessarily free of pesticides, but there are generally a lesser amount that what you would find normally. In fact, even food that is treated with pesticides are generally washed and cleaned which makes most of the differences rather nominal.\n\nWhat Are the Cons of Organic Food?\n\nExpense: There is little doubt that organic foods are more expensive than their non-organic counterparts. For many, the expense is such that going all-organic can be very difficult with their respective budgets. There are many people however who selectively purchase their favorite types of organic foods while buying typical grocery store foods as well.\n\nShorter Shelf Life: Because they have fewer preservatives, organic foods will not last as long and will need to be consumed faster than their non-organic counterparts. This means that you will have to make more frequent purchases or find ways to preserve the organic foods at home.\n\nChemicals: Despite the common belief to the contrary, organic foods do have chemicals involved in their productions which are normally pesticides. To qualify as organic, the amount of pesticides used must fall under a certain amount.\n\nThe studies are certainly mixed when it comes to whether eating all organic foods is healthier than consuming their non-organic counterparts. Put simply, there is yet to be any real scientific evidence that eating organic foods will make you healthier or better off than if you simply stick to the same food provided in the grocery stores.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

Liposuction itself is the direct removal of fat from the body, although the exact methods may differ according to the equipment that is used. While some forms of liposuction scrape the fat from inside the body, laser liposuction actually melts the fat as it is being removed.\n\nWhat Are the Pros of Liposuction?\n\nThere are a number of benefits to using the liposuction procedure and in many cases they do outweigh the disadvantages.\n\nImmediate Results: This particular procedure has an immediate impact because it removes the fat directly. This means that you\u2019ll see the difference as soon as the procedure is complete in the areas where it was used. In addition, when the swelling from the liposuction goes down, the improvements will become even more dramatic. Compared to traditional methods of weight loss, this is arguably the quickest form that you can find.\n\nSafe & Quick: Liposuction is a time-tested method that has been used on many thousands of people. Over that time, there have been relatively few complications that have resulted from this procedure. In addition, there is far less downtime to this form of fat removal as compared to other methods. This makes it the preferred way to surgically remove the fat.\n\nBecause the fat removal is permanent, eating right and exercising will meant that you will retain your leaner appearance.\n\nWhat Are the Cons of Liposuction?\n\nHowever, while the procedure is has many advantages, there are a few disadvantages that you will need to consider before undergoing the surgery. Be sure to take to your physician before making your decision about whether this is best for you.\n\nGeneral Anesthesia: While mostly safe, it is not as safe as being under local anesthesia, yet traditional liposuction requires the patient to be under general anesthesia which does offer some complications to a small number of people.\n\nConstant Maintenance: In order to prevent the fat cells from coming back to the area which they were removed, the person has to maintain a healthy diet and exercise routine. Otherwise, the area will fill up and may even look worse that before.\n\nComplications: There are a number of complications that may result from the traditional liposuction method, including the following:\n\nDelayed healing, wound separation and scarring.\n\nOne or more of these complications may occur when you undergo a liposuction procedure. Even when the proper care is taken, that may not prevent complications from occurring.\n\nPain and Discomfort: Traditional liposuction may involve a painful recovery period as the body recovers from the surgery, incisions, swelling and other adjustments that have to be made.\n\nLiposuction is really designed as a cosmetic procedure to address a single area of the body and not one that is designed to lose weight on a permanent basis. For those who have a small area of their bodies were the fat does not easily burn away, then liposuction may be the perfect treatment.

    "content": "The tummy tuck is a common surgical procedure which is especially designed for women who have undergone either several pregnancies or have endured great fluctuations in weight that has caused an excess of skin to develop over their mid-section. The condition may happen in men as well if they lost a dramatic amount of weight quickly which has now allows the skin to properly contract.\n\nThe tummy tuck itself is really just a means of getting rid of the excess skin. However, there are procedures that will actually shore up the abdominal section as well. The real question is whether the tummy tuck is suitable for everyone as there are benefits and complications that those who choose the operation will need to consider.\n\nWhat Are the Pros of a Tummy Tuck?\n\nExercise: Once your doctor approves, you can augment your new appearance with vigorous exercise that will strengthen the mid-section even more and create a very flattering appearance. For many, it is much easier to start an exercise program where the starting point is so much closer to the desired result.\n\nConfidence Improvement: Arguably the biggest benefit from a tummy tuck is the boost in confidence you will receive when sporting your new look. By getting rid of the excess skin, you will certain be more confident in appearance. While the surgery will take some time to properly heal, you will still see almost instant results from the procedure. Your skin is tighter, the cellulite and stretch marks are virtually gone and even if some scarring shows, it will usually not be as noticeable or considered as unattractive the condition that you had before the procedure.\n\nWhat Are the Cons of a Tummy Tuck?\n\nAs with any surgical procedure there is the small risk of something going wrong during the surgery itself. However, there are other issues that you will need to consider as well.\n\nScarring: Depending on the extent of the tummy tuck, the scarring may be minimal or quite noticeable. What is certain is that there will be a scar from the operation, it will just depend in large part on its location and how discreet it can be made. For example, a scar that runs across the abdomen may remain below the line where swimsuits reach so a bikini is still possible to wear. However, other types of scars may be more prominent and less likely to remain hidden.\n\nPrice: As with any cosmetic or elective surgery, these tend to become rather expensive and will range between $3,000 up to $10,000 depending on just how extensive the surgery turns out to be. The good news is that many surgeons have financing options that will help you pay for the procedure, but it still is rather expensive as it costs as much as a decent used vehicle.\n\nOverall, the tummy tuck is a surgical procedure that offers a tighter, more attractive mid-section that gets rid of the flabby, unattractive appearance of stretch marks and excess skin. For many, it is the type of procedure that offers many benefits that outweigh the potential risks.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

However, it must be stated that being a little overweight is better than being a little underweight, though obesity is really too much weight for the body to naturally handle.\n\nStill, for those who are obese there are a few benefits that they will enjoy for a short time at least before the negative heath effects kick in.\n\nFirst and foremost, you do not have to worry about becoming fat because you are already there. Although, to get even fatter will mean risking morbid obesity which can cause sudden death, a subject that you probably do not want to breach.\n\nMore Insulation: Your body now has an extra layer of protection from the cold as well as having more to sweat off in the summer heat.\n\nMore Identifiable: Being recognizably obese means that you are harder to kidnap as well as having someone use your stolen identity if they know you.\n\nMore Stores: Today, there are more retail clothing stores dedicated to your size which means that your choices of clothing are probably better today than ever.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these advantages mean much compared to the impact on your health. To get back down to a healthy weight should be your top priority.\n\nHeart Disease: Being obese means that your heart and circulatory system are under more pressure which creates greater vulnerabilities when it comes to suffering from heart attacks and strokes. Just the sheer pressure of carrying around the extra weight may lead to considerable damage to your circulatory system.\n\nDiabetes: For those suffering from diabetes, being obese can lead to the loss of limbs, blindness and death. Losing the weight becomes imperative if you have contracted diabetes because the longer you remain overweight, the more damage that might occur. However, for those with Type 2 diabetes, losing all of the excess weight may mean not having to use insulin injections.\n\nArthritis: Obesity means more weight and pressure on the joints which in turn creates greater stress which makes it difficult enough to move around. When you add to that suffering from arthritis it can really add to the pain and suffering. For those who have arthritis, it can be very difficult to lose the excess weight which means more immobility and pain.\n\nShame: Whether it is politically correct or not, obese people are still judged by many as being lazy or unwilling to control their own diet. Studies have shown that obesity is a barrier to employment and advancement opportunities in the workplace, making it that much harder to get by.\n\nOverall, being obese has too many health risks for it to be considered the best way to live. Again, while being a little overweight is fine and maybe even beneficial in certain regards, being obese is a condition that must be addressed if you want to live a long, healthy life.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Losing weight is never fun and for most of us, it\u2019s not easy \u2013 especially as we get older. The good news is after 25 years of consulting, I have a great \u201cblue-print\u201d for losing stubborn fat \u2026 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to share with you today.\n\nThe \u201cAnti-Depressant\u201d Challenge\n\nLosing weight is difficult as it is, but it\u2019s an even bigger challenge when you\u2019re taking antidepressants. And the reason is due to your change in hormones.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve discovered TWO main reasons for the weight gain from use of antidepressants.\n\nFIRST \u2013 The most commonly prescribe antidepressants, SSRIs such as Prozac, Lexapro, Paxil and Zoloft \u2013 they work by increasing serotonin, which helps regulate your appetite. So typically, antidepressant users start eating more because their appetite has increased, which is the initial and primary cause of weight gain.\n\nSECOND \u2013 Another phenomenon that I\u2019ve noticed over the years is with people who swear they aren\u2019t eating more and yet, they still gain weight. After doing lots of different blood work, I\u2019ve noticed a change in metabolic markers, one of them being lowered thyroid production, as well as a change adrenal function \u2013 such as higher cortisol levels (stress hormone) and lower adrenal production. Both leading to a slower metabolism and faster weight gain.\n\nIt\u2019s All About The Hormones\n\nAs you can see, hormones really do control everything. Throw in aging and now things get a bit more challenging.\n\nToday I\u2019m going to give you some great suggestions which will help reduce your appetite and maximize your fat loss. But we\u2019ll ALSO be optimizing your fat burning hormones \u2013 which means a faster metabolism, more energy and healthier fat loss \u2013 especially in those stubborn fat areas.\n\nSo, don\u2019t worry \u2013 it\u2019s not your fault. There is hope, I\u2019ve got the solution and you CAN do it!\n\nBefore Getting Started\n\nSo before I reveal some \"shortcuts\" to stripping off that ugly fat, I'd like to get a couple things out of the way:\n\nNO Drugs - Even though there are specific drugs you can take that'll speed up the fat loss, unfortunately they're loaded with side-effects and later, you'll eventually gain all the weight back when you get off of the drug. But, don't worry... I'll show you an all-natural solution that works great, with fast results.\n\nNO \"Weight Loss\" - The other thing is you want to lose FAT, not just \"weight\", which is usually valuable muscle loss. Unfortunately, most weight loss programs cause the wrong type of weight loss. Today I'll show you how to decrease the inches in those stubborn areas like your belly, arms, hips and legs for the ladies.\n\nOkay, so let's get started with the...\n\n3 Best Methods To Lose Fat Quickly\n\nThere are really 3 main keys to healthy, long-term fat loss and I'm going to simplify it for you.\n\nDiet - this is one of the most important, since you can easily consume more calories than you can burn.\n\nExercise - by doing the right form of exercise you'll burn more calories, which will allow you to eat more food or not diet as hard.\n\nSupplements - the right kind will improve your \"fat burning genes\" by up-regulating key fat burning hormones, which means faster fat loss.\n\nThe most important aspect of fat loss is your diet because you can easily consume MORE calories than you can burn. It's just so easy and that's why we have to watch what you eat. So, here are a few \"fast result\" diet tips.\n\nLet's first start with the things you should NOT do because these will quickly sabotage any weight loss goals you'll ever have.\n\nDo NOT Eat Carbohydrates I started with the hardest one, but that's because most carbohydrates (grains, breads, pastas, rice, etc.) are very calorie dense and make you retain lots of water weight. Another major problem is that they easily convert to fat due to the high blood sugar response. IF you're going to have them, do so only after an exercise session.\n\nDo NOT Drink Your Calories There is no point in drinking any calories since that takes seconds to consume. This means no soda, fruit juice, blended coffee drinks or protein shakes and smoothies. Oh yeah, no alcohol either =(\n\nDo NOT Eat Sauces This is easier for most people, but don't consume any sauces, syrups, salad dressings, etc. Too calorie dense and either loaded with sugar and/or fats. Instead, have lemon juice and vinegar on your salad.\n\nLet's move on to the things you CAN and should do...\n\nDO Eat Carbohydrates Okay, I know I just told you not to, but carbs are very good for your metabolism because they improve your thyroid production. You just need to eat the right kinds and that's primarily from unlimited vegetables, some fruits, legumes and occasionally some sweet potatoes if you want a \"treat\".\n\nDO Drink Unlimited water and green tea. Mix in lemon juice and sweeten with natural Stevia and you have a great tasting and healthy drink that will also curb your appetite.\n\nDO Eat Protein You should have some protein, but limit it to fish, chicken and lean meats. No more than 4 oz daily and do NOT fry the meats or cook with oils.\n\nThe second most important formula for fat loss success is exercise.\n\nIdeally you should do BOTH aerobic AND anaerobic exercise.\n\nThis means cardiovascular - like walking, running, treadmill, etc.\n\nAnd also lifting weights to increase muscle mass - using free weights, machines and cables. In fact, the weight lifting is more important for FAT loss because the extra muscle burns fat all day long and helps give shape to your body.\n\nYou may lose less \"weight\" on the scale because of the extra muscle size, but you'll lose more UGLY FAT in those stubborn areas, which matters most.\n\nAnyway, just try to do something daily. For faster results, try exercising 2x daily.\n\nFor example, you can walk in the morning for 20-30 minutes and do weights in the afternoon for 20-30 minutes. This is the BEST case scenario... I wouldn't expect you to start here, unless you're super motivated or you want faster results.\n\nBut just try to do a minimum of 20-30 minutes, 3x weekly of any form of exercise to begin with.\n\nTaking specific herbs, vitamins and minerals that are scientifically proven to help lose \"weight\" is useful if you want to:\n\nspeed up your fat loss results (especially stubborn fat areas)\n\nincrease your metabolism (like when you were younger)\n\nreduce your appetite (especially for sugars and carbohydrates)\n\nWe all know of people who can eat whatever they want, not exercise and they don't really gain much weight. This has to do with genetics and hormones.\n\nThis is why when women are menstruating or they're menopausal, they gain weight - in all the wrong places - HORMONES.\n\nLean Optimizer\u2122 helps promote healthy fat burning hormones and enzymes, naturally.\n\nSummary & Bottom Line\n\nYou need to eat better and exercise daily - these should be your primary goals.\n\nBy utilizing Lean Optimizer with the right diet and exercise program, means healthy fat loss, for long-term results.\n\nOne major reason Lean Optimizer\u2122 is better than other options is because it's doctor formulated and scientifically tested to work.\n\nThe feedback has been is really great and since the product has been around for 22+ years, you know it works!\n\nAnyways, take a look Lean Optimizer\u2122 ... how it works, benefits, reviews, ingredients, etc...",

Many smokers turn to food to satisfy this need for \u201coral gratification.\u201d\n\nMy suggestion is to use chewing gum initially and I\u2019ll also discuss some natural appetite suppressants as well.\n\nFinally, Nicotine also helps increase your thyroid levels, while decreasing your estrogen \u2013 this means better fat burning due to a change in your hormones.\n\nIt\u2019s All About The Hormones\n\nAs you can see, hormones really do control everything. Throw in aging and now things get a bit more challenging.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to give you some great options which will help decrease your appetite and maximize your fat loss. But we\u2019ll ALSO be optimizing your fat burning hormones \u2013 which means a faster metabolism, more energy and healthier fat loss \u2013 especially in those stubborn fat areas.\n\nSo, don\u2019t worry \u2013 it\u2019s not your fault. There is hope, I\u2019ve got the solution and you CAN do it!\n\nBefore Getting Started\n\nSo before I reveal some \"shortcuts\" to stripping off that ugly fat, I'd like to get a couple things out of the way:\n\nNO Drugs - Even though there are specific drugs you can take that'll speed up the fat loss, unfortunately they're loaded with side-effects and later, you'll eventually gain all the weight back when you get off of the drug. But, don't worry... I'll show you an all-natural solution that works great, with fast results.\n\nNO \"Weight Loss\" - The other thing is you want to lose FAT, not just \"weight\", which is usually valuable muscle loss. Unfortunately, most weight loss programs cause the wrong type of weight loss. Today I'll show you how to decrease the inches in those stubborn areas like your belly, arms, hips and legs for the ladies.\n\nOkay, so let's get started with the...\n\n3 Best Methods To Lose Fat Quickly\n\nThere are really 3 main keys to healthy, long-term fat loss and I'm going to simplify it for you.\n\nDiet - this is one of the most important, since you can easily consume more calories than you can burn.\n\nExercise - by doing the right form of exercise you'll burn more calories, which will allow you to eat more food or not diet as hard.\n\nSupplements - the right kind will improve your \"fat burning genes\" by up-regulating key fat burning hormones, which means faster fat loss.\n\nThe most important aspect of fat loss is your diet because you can easily consume MORE calories than you can burn. It's just so easy and that's why we have to watch what you eat. So, here are a few \"fast result\" diet tips.\n\nLet's first start with the things you should NOT do because these will quickly sabotage any weight loss goals you'll ever have.\n\nDo NOT Eat Carbohydrates I started with the hardest one, but that's because most carbohydrates (grains, breads, pastas, rice, etc.) are very calorie dense and make you retain lots of water weight. Another major problem is that they easily convert to fat due to the high blood sugar response. IF you're going to have them, do so only after an exercise session.\n\nDo NOT Drink Your Calories There is no point in drinking any calories since that takes seconds to consume. This means no soda, fruit juice, blended coffee drinks or protein shakes and smoothies. Oh yeah, no alcohol either =(\n\nDo NOT Eat Sauces This is easier for most people, but don't consume any sauces, syrups, salad dressings, etc. Too calorie dense and either loaded with sugar and/or fats. Instead, have lemon juice and vinegar on your salad.\n\nLet's move on to the things you CAN and should do...\n\nDO Eat Carbohydrates Okay, I know I just told you not to, but carbs are very good for your metabolism because they improve your thyroid production. You just need to eat the right kinds and that's primarily from unlimited vegetables, some fruits, legumes and occasionally some sweet potatoes if you want a \"treat\".\n\nDO Drink Unlimited water and green tea. Mix in lemon juice and sweeten with natural Stevia and you have a great tasting and healthy drink that will also curb your appetite.\n\nDO Eat Protein You should have some protein, but limit it to fish, chicken and lean meats. No more than 4 oz daily and do NOT fry the meats or cook with oils.\n\nThe second most important formula for fat loss success is exercise.\n\nIdeally you should do BOTH aerobic AND anaerobic exercise.\n\nThis means cardiovascular - like walking, running, treadmill, etc.\n\nAnd also lifting weights to increase muscle mass - using free weights, machines and cables. In fact, the weight lifting is more important for FAT loss because the extra muscle burns fat all day long and helps give shape to your body.\n\nYou may lose less \"weight\" on the scale because of the extra muscle size, but you'll lose more UGLY FAT in those stubborn areas, which matters most.\n\nAnyway, just try to do something daily. For faster results, try exercising 2x daily.\n\nFor example, you can walk in the morning for 20-30 minutes and do weights in the afternoon for 20-30 minutes. This is the BEST case scenario... I wouldn't expect you to start here, unless you're super motivated or you want faster results.\n\nBut just try to do a minimum of 20-30 minutes, 3x weekly of any form of exercise to begin with.\n\nTaking specific herbs, vitamins and minerals that are scientifically proven to help lose \"weight\" is useful if you want to:\n\nspeed up your fat loss results (especially stubborn fat areas)\n\nincrease your metabolism (like when you were younger)\n\nreduce your appetite (especially for sugars and carbohydrates)\n\nWe all know of people who can eat whatever they want, not exercise and they don't really gain much weight. This has to do with genetics and hormones.\n\nThis is why when women are menstruating or they're menopausal, they gain weight - in all the wrong places - HORMONES.\n\nLean Optimizer\u2122 helps promote healthy fat burning hormones and enzymes, naturally.\n\nSummary & Bottom Line\n\nYou need to eat better and exercise daily - these should be your primary goals.\n\nBy utilizing Lean Optimizer with the right diet and exercise program, means healthy fat loss, for long-term results.\n\nOne major reason Lean Optimizer\u2122 is better than other options is because it's doctor formulated and scientifically tested to work.\n\nThe feedback has been is really great and since the product has been around for 22+ years, you know it works!\n\nAnyways, take a look Lean Optimizer\u2122 ... how it works, benefits, reviews, ingredients, etc...",

The good news is after 25 years of consulting, I have a great \u201cblue-print\u201d for losing stubborn fat \u2026 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to share with you today.\n\nThe \u201cThyroidectomy\u201d Challenge\n\nLosing weight is difficult as it is, but it\u2019s an even bigger challenge after you\u2019ve had a Thyroidectomy \u2013 which is a removal of your thyroid gland. And the reason is due to a slower metabolism because of a change in hormones.\n\nIn fact, both my dad and my aunt have had a thyroidectomy, so I\u2019m very familiar with what happens during and after, so I can surely help you today.\n\nWhether you\u2019ve had a partial or full thyroidectomy, most likely you\u2019ll need to be on thyroid replacement medication. The main difference with a partial thyroidectomy is you sill have SOME of your thyroid gland and thus, you\u2019ll need a lower dose of thyroid medication.\n\nNow, the main problem is that most doctors only prescribe T4 thyroid and that\u2019s usually not enough to boost your metabolism.\n\nA better approach would be to ALSO take T3 thyroid, combined with T4 \u2013 which is a more natural combination.\n\nIn fact, T3 thyroid is the ACTIVE hormone which does all the fat burning and controls your metabolism.\n\nThe problem with taking only T4 thyroid is that your life-style (diet, exercise, stress level, etc.) can influence how much T4, converts to the active T3. And the less conversion to T3, the slower your metabolism and the harder it is to lose weight.\n\nIt\u2019s All About The Hormones\n\nAs you can see, hormones really do control everything. Throw in aging and stress\u2026 and now things get a bit more challenging.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to give you some great suggestions which will help improve your thyroid conversion to the active T3 and maximize your fat loss.

Your body is very efficient and doesn\u2019t burn calories very much because of your hormones \u2013 such as lower thyroid, elevated insulin, decreased leptin and so forth.\n\nSo, you have to be extra careful with your diet, put in more time into your exercise program and utilize more fat-burning supplements and nutrients.\n\nIt\u2019s All About The Hormones\n\nAs you can see, hormones really do control everything.

Instead, have lemon juice and vinegar on your salad.\n\nLet's move on to the things you CAN and should do...\n\nDO Eat Carbohydrates Okay, I know I just told you not to, but carbs are very good for your metabolism because they improve your thyroid production. You just need to eat the right kinds and that's primarily from unlimited vegetables, some fruits, legumes and occasionally some sweet potatoes if you want a \"treat\".\n\nDO Drink Unlimited water and green tea. Mix in lemon juice and sweeten with natural Stevia and you have a great tasting and healthy drink that will also curb your appetite.\n\nDO Eat Protein You should have some protein, but limit it to fish, chicken and lean meats. No more than 4 oz daily and do NOT fry the meats or cook with oils.\n\nThe second most important formula for fat loss success is exercise.\n\nIdeally you should do BOTH aerobic AND anaerobic exercise.\n\nThis means cardiovascular - like walking, running, treadmill, etc.\n\nAnd also lifting weights to increase muscle mass - using free weights, machines and cables. In fact, the weight lifting is more important for FAT loss because the extra muscle burns fat all day long and helps give shape to your body.\n\nYou may lose less \"weight\" on the scale because of the extra muscle size, but you'll lose more UGLY FAT in those stubborn areas, which matters most.\n\nAnyway, just try to do something daily. For faster results, try exercising 2x daily.\n\nFor example, you can walk in the morning for 20-30 minutes and do weights in the afternoon for 20-30 minutes. This is the BEST case scenario... I wouldn't expect you to start here, unless you're super motivated or you want faster results.\n\nBut just try to do a minimum of 20-30 minutes, 3x weekly of any form of exercise to begin with.\n\nTaking specific herbs, vitamins and minerals that are scientifically proven to help lose \"weight\" is useful if you want to:\n\nspeed up your fat loss results (especially stubborn fat areas)\n\nincrease your metabolism (like when you were younger)\n\nreduce your appetite (especially for sugars and carbohydrates)\n\nWe all know of people who can eat whatever they want, not exercise and they don't really gain much weight. This has to do with genetics and hormones.\n\nThis is why when women are menstruating or they're menopausal, they gain weight - in all the wrong places - HORMONES.\n\nLean Optimizer\u2122 helps promote healthy fat burning hormones and enzymes, naturally.\n\nSummary & Bottom Line\n\nYou need to eat better and exercise daily - these should be your primary goals.\n\nBy utilizing Lean Optimizer with the right diet and exercise program, means healthy fat loss, for long-term results.\n\nOne major reason Lean Optimizer\u2122 is better than other options is because it's doctor formulated and scientifically tested to work.\n\nThe feedback has been is really great and since the product has been around for 22+ years, you know it works!\n\nAnyways, take a look Lean Optimizer\u2122 ... how it works, benefits, reviews, ingredients, etc...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness-se/using-marinol-for-anxiety/",
    "content": "There are many different types of drugs used for the treatment of anxiety. One of the more interesting started as a way to help AIDS victims eat more food to prevent weight loss. Today, marinol is considered one of the more prescribed drugs in the fight against anxiety.\n\nBasically, marinol is a man-made form of cannabis that was developed for use to treat people who sustained a loss of appetite which caused weight loss due to having AIDS. In addition, it is also used to treat people who suffer from nausea and vomiting that is caused by chemotherapy which is a common treatment for cancer. In these particular cases, marinol is considered a last resort after other drugs have been tried and failed.\n\nAs with many different drugs, the use of marinol was expanded to include those who suffer from anxiety because of its recorded effects on patients who were using marinol for other illnesses. Because it did have a calming effect on people, marinol was rather quickly used for those who suffer from general anxiety.\n\nThe Potential Side Effects of Marinol\n\nFor those who take marinol, it is important to remember to not mix it with any other drugs that might affect the central nervous system. Otherwise, the potential reaction may be very serious and require immediate medical treatment. This includes any form of stimulants, diet pills, pain and cold medicines, muscle relaxers, mental illness and even other drugs used in the treatment of anxiety.\n\nThere are also a number of conditions where marinol should not be used. Your doctor will have a complete list and it is vital that you report any medical condition that you have before taking marinol to avoid any potential reaction.\n\nAs part of the cannabis family, marinol may be habit forming especially if taken over the long term. However, for the most part marinol does not produce any serious side effects for most people. In certain cases it may cause the following to occur.\n\nConfusion or delusions or hallucinations\n\nFeelings of unreality\n\nIn certain circumstances, marinol may actually cause what it has been prescribed to prevent. However, these particular cases are generally rare. In even fewer cases, people have reported becoming dizzy, having chills, blurred vision, sweating and feelings of weakness.\n\nOverall, most people will find marinol effective in treating their anxiety as it provides a calming feeling similar to that of people who use cannabis where the drug is derived. However, the most important side effect that people should be wary of is potential addiction. Much like cannabis, marinol may become a habit that is hard to kick if taken over a long period of time. For those who feel that this product may cause such a habit to form, there are other drugs that can take the place of marinol instead. Be sure to discuss with your doctor all the alternatives available before taking marinol.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss/8-clinically-proven-ways-to-lose-belly-fat-build-muscle-look-10-years-younger/",
    "content": "Most people want to lose weight \u2013 whether it\u2019s on the scale \u2026 maybe you want to lose 5 or 10 or 25 lbs. Or maybe in specific body parts or areas\u2026 such as the stomach for most people, especially men. And legs, butt, and maybe arms for women.\n\nAnd most of us want to do it for vanity reasons \u2013 we just want to look better and feel more confident.\n\nAnd of course, there are good reasons to lose unwanted fat for longevity and better health, especially belly fat \u2013 which is the unhealthiest of all fats because it surrounds all of your organs.1\n\nUnfortunately, most people do all the wrong things when it comes to losing weight and the end result is a slower metabolism, muscle loss, wrinkles, and low energy levels.\n\nThe worst part is they end up screwing up their hormones long-term, which inevitably causes them to gain all the weight back and usually, some more.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to make things super simple and easy for you.\n\nI\u2019ll reveal 8 clinically proven ways that will allow you to lose unwanted weight, decrease unhealthy belly fat, build muscle, and tone up in the process \u2026 with the end result being that you\u2019ll look and feel younger.\n\nAnd the best part is that you\u2019ll be able to maintain the positive results long-term because you\u2019ll have a faster metabolism and better \u201cfat-burning\u201d hormones.\n\n1 \u2013 Don\u2019t Drink Your Calories\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get rid of hidden calories is to not DRINK your calories. This means no shakes, smoothies, sodas, Alcohol, fruit juices, coffee with \u201cstuff\u201d in there, or anything else.\n\nThe main problem is that all of these drinks have sugar in them and part of this sugar is made up of fructose\u2026. Which is found in fruit and table sugar.\n\nThe main issue with fructose is that your body can only store a limited amount and the rest gets converted to fat, especially belly fat.2,3\n\nJust remember that all sugar causes blood sugar problems and insulin resistance, which causes weight gain and muscle loss.3\n\nSo this basically means you drink primarily water, tea, black coffee, and maybe low-calorie \u201cgreen drinks\u201d that contain no sugar.\n\n2 \u2013 Eat The RIGHT Carbs\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with carbohydrates, IF you eat the right ones. Most \u201cman-made\u201d carbohydrates shoot up your blood sugar and store the calories as fat, instead of getting used up for energy.\n\nThe good news is that there are many healthy carbs that actually increase your metabolism and burn fat, plus they taste good too\u2026. Such as yams, sweet potatoes, millet, white rice, and others.\n\nI\u2019ll discuss them in detail in a future article and also reveal the best time to eat carbs and how much, to maximize your energy levels and NOT get them stored as fat!\n\n3 \u2013 Eat The RIGHT Protein\n\nWe all need to eat protein, they are essential to health. Protein increases your metabolism, reduces cravings, improves hormones, burns belly fat, and helps maintain muscle.4,5,6\n\nUnfortunately, most people eat too much of the wrong proteins \u2014 which actually ends up causing more health issues.\n\nLimit your protein to about 25-30 grams per meal, so it\u2019s better digested and puts less stress on your liver and kidneys.5\n\nIn my next article, I\u2019ll let you know all the good and bad protein sources. The ones that increase and decrease your metabolism and which ones are the best for your health \u2014 for REDUCING disease, rather than increasing it.\n\nEating vegetables is very important, especially when you eat protein. This is because protein is acidic and you want to vegetables to help alkalize your body and reduce inflammation.7\n\nAdditionally, vegetables have lots of fiber \u2013 which speeds up weight loss and keeps you full8\n\nUnfortunately, most people just don\u2019t eat enough vegetables, or they prepare them incorrectly or unknowingly, eat vegetables that actually cause health issues such as inflammation, allergies, and colon problems.\n\nI\u2019ll discuss all of this in detail in a future article. However, do your best to eat some vegetables with all of your meals \u2013 raw or steamed. Try to get a variety of colors, but the emphasis should be on the green ones.\n\nMost people are afraid of fats. They think that eating fat makes you fat. This is not true. In fact, certain fats help increase your metabolism, improve your hormones, and burn more fat in stubborn areas.\n\nUnfortunately, most people are not getting enough of the good fats and are getting too much of the wrong, unhealthy fats\u2026. Those that cause inflammation and actually slow down your metabolism.\n\nPeople mistakenly believe that \u201cvegetable\u201d or \u201cseed\u201d oils such as canola, sesame, soybean, sunflower, corn, and similar \u201csupermarket\u201d oils are good for them. But, they aren\u2019t because they\u2019re high in Omega 6 fats, which cause inflammation, insulin resistance, and the slowing of your metabolism.\n\nBetter to eat macadamia nut, grapeseed, specific forms of extra virgin olive oil, and raw nuts.\n\nI\u2019ll get into more details in the future, including what foods to avoid eating fats with and the best times of the day to fat.\n\nOne of the best tips I can give for better overall health is for you to sleep better. This is because quality sleep improves all of your hormones \u2013 by improving your fat burning, and youth hormones while reducing your stress hormones.\n\nSleep also heals and detoxifies your body \u2013 which is needed for you to get rid of unwanted fat.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll notice I didn\u2019t say sleep \u201cmore\u201d\u2026 I said sleep BETTER.\n\nMost people don\u2019t sleep enough and if they do, it\u2019s the poor quality which means your body never fully repairs itself. And I\u2019ll get deeper into this in the future.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and try to at least go to bed 30-60 minutes earlier each night, this alone will improve the quality of your sleep.\n\nThe right form of exercise is vital for improving your metabolism, burning stubborn fat, and most importantly, maintaining and building muscle.9,10\n\nRemember, the more muscle you have, the faster your metabolism and the more calories you\u2019ll burn doing nothing. 9,10\n\nIn fact, one of the primary reasons for gaining fat as you age is because you\u2019re also losing muscle each year.\n\nOf course, as with anything \u2013 there are good and wrong forms of exercise. For example, running is a \u201cbad\u201d form of exercise and I\u2019ll get into the details about this in my next article.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is that you lift weights \u2013 machines, cables, free weights, or even your own body weight.9\n\n8 \u2013 Taking Specific Nutrients\n\nDid you know that if your body is lacking specific nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and herbs, you\u2019ll constantly crave food, especially carbohydrates? Your thyroid and metabolism will slow down, as well as the production of important fat-burning hormones.\n\nThis is why I put so much emphasis on what you eat \u2013 to make sure you get these specific nutrients that 99% of us are lacking.\n\nSadly, because of genetics and aging, most of us aren\u2019t able to absorb these nutrients as well as we did when we were younger or people who have \u201cskinny\u201d genetics.\n\nSo by taking specific nutrients and herbs, you can literally turn on your \u201cfat-burning\u201d genes, reduce your appetite AND increase your energy levels\u2026 all day long.\n\nSo there you have it. I\u2019ve given you 8 clinically proven ways to lose stubborn fat, gain muscle, and increase your metabolism, so you can look and feel younger.\n\nPlease start implementing at least one of the solutions that you\u2019ve learned today. You don\u2019t have to do them all at once. Pick the easiest one for you, take action, and keep making improvements every day.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/artificial-sweeteners-cause-weight-gain-cancer-brain-death/",
    "content": "Today I want to quickly talk about an ingredient that\u2019s found in over 5000+ different products. Something that\u2019s used primarily in \u201chealth\u201d products, but ironically \u2013 it\u2019s horrible for your health and that\u2019s artificial sweeteners.\n\nThese \u201cfake sugars\u201d are:\n\nLinked to serious health problems\n\nNeurotoxins to your brain\n\nIronically, they increase your appetite and sugar cravings\n\nSerious Health Problems\n\nOver the past few decades and years, artificial sweeteners have been linked to various serious health problems.\n\nThe first artificial sweetener, Saccharin \u2013 was invented in 1879 by accident. Yet, it took almost 100 years (1970) before it was revealed that Saccharin was linked to bladder problems.1,3 With more research, scientists discovered that it also caused urinary, lung, stomach, and reproductive tumors.4,5\n\nThen came along Aspartame (e.g., NutraSweet\u00ae and Equal\u00ae), which was linked to blood and brain problems.1,6\n\nAnd a few years ago (2002) Sucralose (known as Splenda\u00ae) was invented. It took over all the other artificial sweeteners because it tasted better, it was heatable, and \u201csafe\u201d. Unfortunately, new research shows that it\u2019s been linked to blood problems.2\n\nOf course, there are studies that also show no correlations to using these artificial ingredients to health problems, but this always seems to be the case.\n\nThen years later, almost 100 years later in the case of Saccharin, it\u2019s confirmed and it\u2019s usually worse than we thought.\n\nSo it\u2019s up to you, but I wouldn\u2019t want to gamble with my health when over and over again it\u2019s been proven that these artificial ingredients will cause health problems and irreversible damage to your body and mind!\n\nNow, if you don\u2019t care about health, maybe you care about gaining weight since after all, that\u2019s the primary reason people take these fake sugars \u2013 to lose weight.\n\nIt\u2019s found in diet foods, drinks, snacks, and candy.\n\nBut ironically, 8 years of scientific research and data has shown that people who consume these fake sugars, especially in diet drinks, gain weight!8\n\nIn another study it also showed that the longer you use these ingredients, the more weight you gain.\n\nBut there were additional problems \u2014 larger waist circumference, as well as a higher incidence of heart problems, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular events.9\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly why.\n\nSome speculate that it could be because these fake sugars actually increase your appetite and sugar cravings. Or the fact that they increase your insulin levels, even though you\u2019re not taking in any \u201ccalories\u201d. Or because they confuse your metabolism and cause disruptions with various hormones and neurotransmitters such as Leptin (appetite control) and Dopamine (pleasure).\n\nFinally, artificial sweeteners are linked to neurological side effects. They are \u201cneurotoxins\u201d. They cause brain and memory problems. 10 This happens because they disrupt serotonin and dopamine production, as well as receptor sites in your nervous system.11\n\nSo my suggestion is that you limit, or best of all, avoid any of these artificial sweeteners. If you want something sweet, try a NATURAL sweetener called Stevia. It\u2019s an herbal extract that\u2019s been used safely in Japan for decades and now it\u2019s gaining a lot of popularity in the US.\n\nYou can also try \u201csugar alcohols\u201d. These end in \u201col\u201d, such as xylitol glucitol, sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, glycerol, and lactitol.\n\nThey have minimal calories but they do cause stomach discomfort in many people, especially at higher dosages.\n\nOr, if you just want to sweeten your coffee or tea or something, a little bit of regular sugar is just fine.\n\nRemember, nature already has the answers!\n\nhttps://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/artificial-sweeteners-fact-sheet\n\nhttps://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/03/30/artificial-sweeteners-cause-cancer.aspx\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2016/01/18/health/where-do-we-stand-artificial-sweeteners/index.html\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1637197/pdf/envhper00482-0170.pdf\n\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/167/3921/1131.short\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8939194?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttp://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/14/1072.full?ijkey=d05b78fb773375ea28e192274713dbb74f25a8ec&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.13376/abstract\n\nJournal of the Canadian Medical Association; July\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7936222\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8373935",

Please take just a few minutes to read this article as I\u2019ve done my best to really keep it short and just get to the point and state the facts.\n\nOne last comment before I start. I know there are MANY people who eat soy and think it\u2019s great because in many ways, they have been \u201cbrain washed\u201d. So, I DO understand that you\u2019ve been told differently and the information in this article may go against everything you\u2019ve ever heard or read about soy.\n\nBut I don\u2019t have an agenda with this.

Chances are they were.\n\nI\u2019m just reporting the FACTS below with the THOUSANDS of REAL life clients we\u2019ve had for the past decade who have ALL benefited by getting OFF of soy products.\n\nSoy Puts Your Body In \u201cEmergency Mode\u201d\n\nA few paragraphs below, I\u2019ve listed a few of the diseases attributed to soy intake, but the most important one (for most of us anyway), is the fact that excess soy in the diet pretty much KILLS your thyroid gland (which means \u2026 yes, you guessed it \u2013 EXCESS body fat !)\n\nThe Committee on Toxicity in Foods and the Environment in Great Britain reports that soy phytoestrogens \u201cmodulate thyroid hormone synthesis\u201d. They also say: \u201csoy phytoestrogens disrupt the pituitary-gonadal axis\u201d.\n\nThis basically means \u2013 CASTRATION!\n\nSo you have these power glands \u2013 the pituitary, the adrenals, and the sex glands \u2013 harnessed together, and if one of them is suppressed, the others react, sending the system into \u201cemergency mode\u201d. And that can make you very sick.\n\nSoy definitely suppresses the pituitary, leading to a decrease in thyroid hormone (thyroxin) production, which can cause narcolepsy, infertility, obesity, learning disabilities, constipation, hair loss, and stunted growth. And that is only the shortlist.\n\nBelow are some of the other medical conditions possibly attributable to soy consumption:\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome\n\nPremature or delayed puberty\n\nThyroid conditions: Graves\u2019 or Hashimoto\u2019s disease, Goiter, Hypothyroidism,\n\nThe Real SCAM About Soy\n\nBefore I go any further \u2026 do you even know why soy became popular all of a sudden a few years ago? There was an EXCESS in soy production worldwide! And, they had to figure out a way to \u201cget rid of it\u201d basically.\n\nThat my friend, is the basic truth. I know this to be FACT because I know very \u201cimportant\u201d people high up at the FDA and DEA. I knew about this years ago. But, as usual, it\u2019s all about the money.\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s continue \u2026.\n\nBig Problems For Women!\n\nOne of the biggest reasons soy became popular a few years ago was its supposed attributes in helping women \u201cfight off\u201d various cancers and menopause problems. Unfortunately, this hasn\u2019t turned out to be true.\n\nNOTE: If you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Or, if you are nursing, for sure stay away from ALL soy products. It screws up your hormones in a big way, as well as causes hormonal problems for your baby.\n\nFive recent studies have all shown that soy is worthless in treating the symptoms of menopause. These studies were performed at Monash University (Australia), Iowa State University, the University of Milan (Italy), and Helsinki University (Finland). Wouldn\u2019t you think that your gynecologist would be warning you of this, rather than prescribing artificial estrogen and progesterone, both of which have been proven to be carcinogenic, and thus adding to the problem of soy-induced disease?\n\nAnother study, this one out of the University of Pittsburgh, might be the most significant of the damning studies on soy. The researchers found that hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness improved in the placebo group, but NOT in the soy group!\n\nAllow me to summarize these remarkable studies that should blow the lid off the soy ploy (but probably won\u2019t):\n\nSoy does not improve menopausal symptoms compared to placebo.\n\nThere is no beneficial effect on frequency, duration, or severity of hot flashes or night sweats with soy.\n\nThe best soy could do was to have an equal reduction in symptoms compared to placebo in some studies.\n\nIn one of the studies, symptoms were relieved in the placebo group but not in the soy group.\n\nSoy causes insomnia in many patients.\n\nI know for a FACT that soy is horrible for both your thyroid and hormonal levels since I have done many blood tests on myself, friends and family. Now, I\u2019m not saying soy will kill you and maybe ONCE a week or so having some soy won\u2019t do anything bad at all.\n\nBut for those of you who are having soy daily, especially if it\u2019s 10% or more of your daily protein intake, STOP it as soon as possible!\n\nYou\u2019re going to get fatter, have muscle loss, get depressed, and have a much lower SEX drive. In fact, one of the reasons Lean Optimizer\u00ae works so well is because it reverses many of the thyroid-related problems of soy. Hence, users see AND feel results within the first few weeks, since their thyroids are normalizing for the first time in YEARS thanks to the active ingredients.\n\nAnd here\u2019s another interesting note \u2026 I realized just a few months ago that those who needed higher dosages of Lean Optimizer\u00ae to see results, were often people who ate soy. Just some \u201cfood for thought\u201d \u2026\n\nSummary: Soy has many BAD qualities. For many people, just a little bit of soy intake can shut down their thyroids and cause problems with other hormones (such as testosterone and estrogen). This can lead to increase fat, loss of muscle, depression, hair loss, always feeling cold, brittle nails, watery or swollen eyes, lethargy, sore bones and joints.\n\nUnfortunately, soy is used in many products these days \u2013 especially DIET products and low-carb foods. Please read the labels. Reduce ANY and ALL soy consumption. Personally, I think the most soy one should have is just once or maybe twice a week \u2013 MAXIMUM.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to eliminate it, but for sure MINIMIZE its consumption!\n\n\u201cSoy: Food, Not Pills,\u201d UC Berkeley Wellness Letter, 1/01\n\n\u201cDietary supplements of soya flour lower serum testosterone concentrations and improve markers of oxidative stress in men.\u201d Eur J Clin Nutr 2003; 57(1): 100-106\n\n\u201cPossible Legal Action On Medical Problems Caused By Soy,\u201d Weston A. Price Foundation (www.westonaprice.org), 3/30/04\n\n\u201cSoy: More studies,\u201d Weston A. Price Foundation (www.westonaprice.org), accessed 4/26/04",

They\u2019re a pivotal component of any diet aimed at improving your body composition and anti-aging, fat-burning hormones.\n\nYes, carbohydrates and fat are also important and provide many body composition benefits, but protein deserves special attention because\n\nIt raises your metabolism because it costs the body more calories to process protein than carbs or fat.

Can my body digest this food easily?\n\nIs this food nutrient-rich? Can my body digest this food easily?\n\nIs this food nutrient-rich? Can my body digest this food easily?\n\nIs this food nutrient-rich?\n\nCan my body digest this food easily?\n\nToday you\u2019ll discover the 5 most nutrient-rich, digestible protein sources and discuss how they can help you lose fat, build muscle and have more energy.\n\nPre Warning \u2014 One thing I\u2019d like to mention is that due to genetics, we all tolerate foods differently. So please pay attention to how YOUR body likes or dislikes any food source, including protein.\n\nEggs are a perfect source of protein, scoring highest on the scientific scale for protein quality because they provide a wealth of amino acids (l-leucine) that are used by your body to repair muscle tissue.\n\nEggs also contain powerful brain nutrients (choline) beneficial fats and vitamins (D, K) Antioxidants that reduce inflammation Improves insulin health and metabolism.\n\nEggs also contain powerful brain nutrients (choline) beneficial fats and vitamins (D, K) Antioxidants that reduce inflammation Improves insulin health and metabolism.\n\nEggs also contain powerful brain nutrients (choline) beneficial fats and vitamins (D, K) Antioxidants that reduce inflammation Improves insulin health and metabolism.\n\npowerful brain nutrients (choline)\n\nbeneficial fats and vitamins (D, K)\n\nAntioxidants that reduce inflammation\n\nImproves insulin health and metabolism.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201csuperfood\u201d that will keep you satisfied and promotes optimal body composition.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m referring to WHOLE eggs, not just the \u201cegg whites\u201d. Nature-made eggs perfect because it contains all the essential amino acids, with the yolk and white forming the perfect blend together.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about an increase in cholesterol, eggs do increase cholesterol \u2014 but the \u201cgood\u201d HDL. It\u2019s a myth that eggs are bad for you.\n\nJust make sure they\u2019re from cage-free, antibiotic-free, and pasture-raised chicken. The darker the yolk, the better the egg.\n\n#2: Whey Protein Isolate\n\nYou probably know that whey protein is the best \u201csports\u201d protein because it stimulates muscle-building \u201cprotein synthesis\u201d more than all other sources.\n\nWhey is highly digestible and contains the best amino acids that are involved in muscle building, metabolism, and immune function.\n\nWhey is great for fat loss and has been used in clinical settings to\n\nsupport healthy blood sugar levels\n\nstimulate mitochondrial activity (more energy)\n\nsupport healthy blood pressure\n\nprevent muscle loss in the elderly\n\nand support healthy blood flow, cholesterol levels, and bone health.\n\nThe BEST type of Whey protein is \u201crBHB/Soy Free, grass-fed ISOLATE\u201d, which contains NO hormones, antibiotics, or sugars. It\u2019s easy to digest and causes no bloat or stomach discomfort.\n\n#3: Grass-Fed, Grass-Finished Beef (BISON)\n\nBeef provides an excellent profile of essential amino acids and it performs well in metabolic studies.\n\nGrass-fed (versus grain-fed or conventional) beef is abundant in non-protein nutrients. It\u2019s high in\n\nomega-3 fats that are also found in fish\n\nglutamine (muscle builder, immune booster)\n\nglycine and glutathione (immune boosters)\n\nCLA (anti-inflammatory, fat loss).\n\nNow, I suggest Bison/Buffalo over beef (cow) because\n\nBetter for the environment\n\nThey are treated a LOT better than cows\n\nEverything about Bison is better than beef/cow meat.\n\nI think wild-caught, salmon is the best fish and probably one of the healthiest sources of protein.\n\nIt has all the correct amino acids and it\u2019s also high in omega 3 fats, which as you may know, is very good for inflammation, your body, skin, hair, eyes, brain and heart.\n\nSalmon is one of the safest fish and typically has the least contaminants and mercury out of all the cold-water fish.\n\nAnd as far as seafood is concerned, stay AWAY for all shellfish!\u2026 They\u2019re \u201cbottom feeders\u201d and cause more harm than good to your body!\n\n#5: Non-Traditional Protein Sources\n\nSome of my favorite and healthiest protein sources are vegetables, collagen, and bone broth. Now, these may not always have the \u201chighest quality\u201d of protein per gram, but in my opinion, they are one of the healthiest.\n\nBone Broth and Collagen proteins are amazing for your joints, skin, hair, muscles, and digestion.\n\nVegetable proteins are fantastic for overall health and longevity, let alone the environment and humanity. In fact, over half of my protein comes from these sources.\n\nAnd this is because there\u2019s a limit to how much \u201canimal\u201d protein you can or should have, especially for someone like me who carries a lot of muscle mass and requires a lot more calories and protein.\n\nSome of my favorite vegetable proteins come from pea, hemp, rice, and alfalfa protein, which is custom-made for me in a great-tasting protein powder.\n\nWhat About Chicken & Poultry?\u2026\n\nYou\u2019ll notice I didn\u2019t list chicken or Poultry because I think it\u2019s an unhealthy animals, especially the way they\u2019re raised and processed in today\u2019s society.\n\nFor one thing, poultry is the ONLY protein source that you can NOT eat \u201craw\u201d. You can with all the others, including beef.\n\nThis is because 98% of poultry is riddled with arsenic and bacteria, including salmonella and E. coli.\n\nBesides, chicken is FAKE these days\u2026 It\u2019s\n\nPlumped and filled with saline\n\nThey are genetically altered to have huge breasts, which means they can\u2019t even walk\n\nThere is almost no such thing as \u201cfree-range\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d. It\u2019s just a play on words that the FDA allows these farmers to get away with.\n\nBut if you\u2019re going to eat some chicken, make sure it\u2019s Kosher, antibiotic-free, and pasture-raised \u2014 which is the healthiest form of poultry.\n\nDon\u2019t eat the same protein source all the time, change it up and listen to your body. The most important aspect of eating protein and improving your body composition and health (less fat, more muscle) is because of the improvements in your hormones.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Burn Fat & Increase Metabolism Click HERE & Continue \u00bb Today\u2019s weight loss hack is one of my favorite drinks that I\u2019ve used for almost 20 years to reduce my appetite, kill my cravings, boost my immune system and dramatically improve my health at the same time.\n\nI\u2019ve had hundreds of my clients, models, athletes and actors on this drink and they\u2019ve ALL had great results.\n\nMost called it Dr. Sam\u2019s Anti-Aging & Weight Loss Lemonade\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s tasty, easy to make and has zero calories. It\u2019s all natural, nothing artificial.\n\nFirst we start with 16 oz of clean, purified water. You can make a liter or even a gallon of this stuff and drink it all day long, which a lot of my clients do.\n\nI prefer room temperature. But if the weather is cold, you can use warm water and if the weather is hot, you can use cold water.\n\nIf we\u2019re using 16 oz for today\u2019s demonstration, then add in about \u00bc to \u00bd of a teaspoon of L-glutamine into the water.\n\nL-Glutamine is a tasteless and odorless amino acid, which has a ton of health benefits.\n\nWhen your body is under stress, it quickly uses up this amino acid. So it\u2019s very important to make sure you\u2019re body has optimal levels of it because your body uses it in large amounts.\n\nSo in addition to fighting stress, L-glutamine also\n\nSupports healthy immune system.2\n\nBurns fat and builds muscle.5,6\n\nSupports healthy blood sugar levels.9\n\nPromotes better digestion, especially for those with \u201cleaky gut\u201d, IBS, ulcers, etc\u20261,2,4\n\nGood for your brain, memory, and focus.3\n\nReduces sugar cravings and even alcohol cravings.7\n\nSo as you can see, there are a TON of wonderful benefits to using L-glutamine and it\u2019s by far my favorite amino acid.\n\nNext, we\u2019re going to add in some lemon juice. I like about 2 tablespoons, but it\u2019s up to you how much you\u2019d like to add, based on your taste buds.\n\nNow, even though lemons are acidic (citrus fruit), they actually help alkalize your body.\n\nInside your body, when lemon juice has been fully metabolized and its minerals are dissociated in your bloodstream, its effect is alkalizing and therefore raises the pH of your body tissue (pH above 7 is alkaline).\n\nMost health problems are caused by inflammation and is acidic. The #1 cause of acidity is NOT your diet, but your mind and your stress levels.\n\nSo adding lemon juice to the water is great and has many health benefits.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t have the time or desire to get fresh lemons, cut, squeeze and clean it all up every day. So I buy organic lemon juice in a bottle.\n\nYes, fresh is best. But if it\u2019s going to be a hassle and you\u2019re not going to do it long-term, then it\u2019s best to pick something that\u2019s easy and convenient, right?\n\nNow, that\u2019s it\u2026 This is the entire drink \u2014 water, glutamine, and lemon juice.\n\nHowever, there are additional \u201chacks\u201d and additions I like to make.\n\nI like my drink sweetened just a little, so it tastes like lemonade. So I put in just a little bit of natural, organic GMO Stevia extract into my drink.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed it also helps further reduce my sugar cravings and I can have more of my \u201canti-aging, weight loss\u201d drink because it\u2019s too tart for me without Stevia.\n\nLastly, you can also add in some green powders into this drink. It\u2019s totally optional and obviously, they can only improve the health benefits.\n\nI typically add in about 1 teaspoon of Yaeyama Chlorella, Spirulina, and maybe some Organic Wheat Grass or Broccoli powder. They have a TON of benefits, taste okay, energize and alkalize your body.\n\nHowever, I only add in these 3 green ingredients first thing in the morning and/or before I exercise. The rest of the time, I only do glutamine, lemon, and stevia.\n\nThere are times when I\u2019m super hungry and I have this drink, within minutes my hunger is gone, and STAYS gone for at least an hour or two!\n\nSo there you have it, the exact formula to Dr. Sam\u2019s Anti-Aging, Weight Loss Lemonade! \u2026 A scientifically proven way to lose weight, keep it off, and stay healthy at the same time\n\nSimple, easy, convenient, tasty, and has no calories.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

Like a linear graph.\n\nSo they get on the scale daily or weekly expecting to always be losing weight. But, this doesn\u2019t happen in the real world.\n\nSome people have a \u201cfast beginning\u201d and you start losing a lot of weight at the beginning, it seems easy and effortless.\n\nBut then your body adapts and weight loss stops. You may even start to gain a little weight.\n\nDON\u2019T give up because if you keep doing all the right things, weight loss will start up again until you hit your next plateau\n\nAnd some people have a slow beginning. Where it seems like there\u2019s no progress at all the first few weeks. This is very frustrating. But then, all of a sudden you lose a big chunk of weight.\n\nAnd then you\u2019ll stop, maybe even gain some weight. Again, DON\u2019T give up, continue doing all the right things and then your body will once again, release a few more pounds almost overnight.\n\nSo sometimes it\u2019s like 2 steps forward, 1 step back\u2026 then 3 steps forward, 1 step back and then something goes wrong and it\u2019s like only 1 step forward and 3-4 steps BACK.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sure you get the point.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much weight you lose in a week. It matters how much weight you\u2019ll lose in a month and ultimately, the end of the year.\n\nAnd most importantly, what you KEEP off long-term. And the reason for all these ups and downs, are the changes in your hormones.\n\nThe \u201chormone\u201d issue affects women a lot more because of their menstrual cycles and water weight and so forth.\n\nBut stress, change in sleep patterns, changes in the types of foods you eat\u2026 or you start to exercise and you gain MUSCLE weight, which also adds additional water weight.\n\nLots of variables when it comes to hormones because they can cause you to gain muscle or lose fat or hold water weight and so many other factors.\n\nJust don\u2019t give up. Keep doing all the right things. Stay focused.\n\nPay MORE attention to how you FEEL and LOOK, not at the silly scale. Success with anything in life has to do patience and persistence\u2026 and executing correct, daily habits week after week, month after month, year after year.\n\nIt\u2019s all about consistency.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "For years and years, I get asked simple and common questions such as \u201cwhat\u2019s the best type of diet?\u201d or \u201cwhat foods should I eat to lose fat\u201d \u2026 Or if the person exercises and goes to the gym, \u201chow should I eat so I can gain some muscle and lose fat at the same time?.\u201d\n\nThese are simple questions, but the answer is complicated because there is no \u201cbest\u201d diet for everyone. This is because we all have different genetics, hormones, metabolic types, and also, BODY types.\n\nSo one question I ask someone if they were to email me such question is, \u201cwhat\u2019s your somatotype\u201d? \u2026\n\n99% of people have no idea what this means.\n\nSo then I ask, \u201cAre you an ectomorph, mesomorph or endomorph?.\u201d\n\nStill, most people (over 90%) still don\u2019t know the answer to this question and it\u2019s a shame, because it\u2019s a very important variable which can determine how much food you can or should eat, let alone the TYPES of foods and most importantly, the ratios of macronutrients \u2013 proteins, carbs, and fats.\n\nThis is why some people do very well on a high fat, low carb diet (ex: ketogenic) \u2013 they look and feel better. While someone else will have very little energy and lose lots of muscle and thus, they will do better on a higher carb, lower fat diet.\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve had a hard time losing fat and/or gaining muscle or basically improving your body composition \u2013 then it may not be your fault. You may be eating a healthy diet, but one that is not well suited for YOUR body type (somatotype).\n\nBecause of this, I\u2019ve created another short article about this topic that I want you to read right now. You can read all about it here: The Best Way To Lose Weight Based On Your Body Type [Clinically Proven].\n\nSo go ahead and do this now, while it\u2019s fresh on your mind.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "When I was younger, I tanned all the time. I mean, that\u2019s what you did in the 80s.\n\nWe\u2019d layout and put baby oil on us, to intensify the sun and get a really dark tan.\n\nNobody would ever use sunscreen.\n\nAnd in the winter, I\u2019d go to the tanning salon.\n\nI know, I know\u2026 I was \u201cyoung and dumb\u201d.\n\nBut not only did I look better with a tan, I also FELT so much better.\n\nBut these days, it\u2019s a different story.\n\nI\u2019m covered up most of the time and I wear a baseball cap when I\u2019m outside.\n\nPlus, these days we\u2019re typically indoors most of the time, especially during the winter. And, I no longer go to the tanning salon.\n\nSo, it\u2019s like the complete opposite\u2026 I barely get any sunlight.\n\nPlease keep in mind that there\u2019s nothing wrong with the sun and it has a million benefits. But you obviously don\u2019t want to overdo it and get a dark tan and you never want to to get a sunburn.\n\nNow, I bring up this topic because during the colder winter months, especially with less sunlight, I notice that I put on a few pounds every year.\n\nMy body fat percentage goes up.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s most people.\n\nGranted, many people will eat more food, they\u2019ll be less active, and so forth.\n\nBut not me, I\u2019m always on my diet, exercise, and supplement program \u2013 year round. I\u2019m like a machine.\n\nSo why the weight gain?\u2026\n\nWell, studies1,2 have shown that an unexpected cause for winter weight gain is the absence of sunlight.\n\nNot only do you gain weight, but it\u2019s mostly fat weight \u2013 the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) that you can grab with your hands. That ugly roll over your belly. The cellulite on the legs and butt.\n\nBasically, the researchers discovered that when the sun\u2019s light wavelengths penetrate our skin and reach the fat cells just beneath, lipid droplets reduce in size and are released out of the cell.\n\nIn other words, our cells don\u2019t store as much fat. They literally shrink in size and get smaller!\n\nThe researchers concluded by saying that, \u201cthe insufficient sunlight exposure we get 8 months of the year living in a northern climate may be promoting fat storage and contribute to the typical weight gain some of us have over winter.\u201d\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean the lack of sun is the ONLY reason. You still need to eat well, exercise, manage your stress, and take your supplements.\n\nSome other studies also state that the sun helps regulate important \u201cfat burning hormones\u201d, such as Cortisol, Ghrelin, Leptin, Thyroid, insulin, and Adiponectin.\n\nThese are very important hormones\u2026 and people with \u201cskinny genetics\u201d have better levels of these hormones. And, so do younger people.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not telling you to go to the tanning salon. Even though, when done correctly, there are many benefits to \u201cartificial sunlight\u201d, which I\u2019ll talk about in a future article.\n\nHowever, the point with today\u2019s topic is you should get outside more and get some sunlight, especially during the winter.\n\nNot only is it good for your health, it also burns fat. Plus, it\u2019s free!\n\nAll you need is about 15-20 minutes daily.\n\nIn fact, the best thing to do is go out for a 20 min walk and get some sun.\n\nNow you have a double fat burner and that\u2019ll also help you live a much longer and happier life.\n\nAnd if you want to burn fat year round, make sure you visit this special link so you can quickly optimize your primary burning hormones.\n\nDo this now while it\u2019s fresh on your mind.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16689-4#Sec7\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss/gluten-vs-lectins-whats-worse-for-your-health/",
    "content": "These days, most people are aware of gluten and that it can be bad for your health. Of course, not everyone is \u201cgluten intolerant\u201d, but many people are.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that lots of people who go on a \u201cgluten-free\u201d diet do, see, and feel an improvement in their health \u2013 but it\u2019s minor.\n\nGluten IS A Lectin?!!\n\nAnd the reason for this is that gluten is a mild form of a Lectin. And thus, the REAL problem is Lectins and that\u2019s what today\u2019s topic is going to be about.\n\nSo getting rid of gluten from your diet for better health is a nice start, but your REAL goal should be to reduce or eliminate lectins from your diet.\n\nDigestive Problems?\u2026 Inflammation?\u2026 Weight Loss?\u2026\n\nAnd just like gluten, not everyone has \u201clectin intolerance\u201d, however\u2026 many people do. And if you have any form of digestive problems, inflammation, autoimmune disease, or you\u2019re trying to lose weight, then make sure you read today\u2019s article because I\u2019ll quickly discuss:\n\nWhy they\u2019re bad for you\n\nAnd what you can and should eat for better health, fitness, and longevity\n\nI\u2019ll keep it short and simplify it all for you.\n\nMy Personal History With Lectins\n\nNow, I\u2019ve known about Lectins for over 25+ years.\n\nAnd the reason I\u2019ve been so knowledgeable about it is mainly through indirect reasons \u2014 primarily because of my involvement with professional and Olympic athletes.\n\nOver the decades, I discovered that when people ate certain Lectin-rich foods \u2013 they looked and felt worse. Slowly they lost muscle, gained fat, felt tired, had more aches and pains, and even their brain and cognition suffered as well.\n\nExcept, 25+ years ago, I and most experts, didn\u2019t know the specific reason was due to Lectins back then. We just knew to avoid specific foods that made us look and feel older! And these just happened to be foods high in Lectins.\n\nA lectin is a type of protein (susceptible to various diseases, bacteria, and viruses) that forces carbs (sugars, starches, and fibers) to clump together and attach to certain cells in your body when you eat them.\n\nThey\u2019re found in lots of different foods, seeds, grains, and the skin of certain vegetables and fruits.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a \u201cdefense\u201d mechanism of the plant or vegetable. If you eat it, you\u2019ll get sick and you won\u2019t eat that food again.\n\nThat\u2019s the simple overview.\n\nAlso, not all lectins are toxic. And not all people are lectin \u201cintolerant\u201d as I stated already.\n\nWhy Lectins Are Bad For You\n\nOn the surface, lectins can cause pain and physical discomfort such as:\n\nAnd other digestive problems\n\nHowever, things can get worse.\n\nLectins, which are also sometimes called \u201csticky proteins\u201d, get in the way of communication between cells. When that happens, the body\u2019s response is usually inflammation or some other type of reaction to toxicity, like nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting.1\n\nAlso, a break in cellular communication can result in symptoms like fatigue or forgetfulness.\n\nAdditionally, lectins can cause you to gain weight. This is the frustrating part for most people because the foods we think are \u201chealthy\u201d for us, also happen to be high in lectins and if you are intolerant, then you\u2019ll have all of the side-effects, INCLUDING WEIGHT GAIN!\n\nFoods High In Lectins\n\nSo here are some of the typical foods that are high in lectins:2-4\n\nGrains \u2014 wheat, quinoa, wheat germ, rice, oats\n\nNightshades \u2014 tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes, goji berries, peppers (unless you peel the skins and deseed them)\n\nBeans \u2014 lima, red kidney, split peas, lentils (unless you pressure cook them)\n\nOf course, now you\u2019re probably thinking that you can\u2019t eat anything.\n\nThis only really pertains to you if you happen to have a high intolerance to lectins. If you don\u2019t do well with Gluten, you for sure won\u2019t do well with Lectins.\n\nIf you want to have grains, white rice is best. And you can have beans, just cook them in a pressure cooker.\n\nFoods With No Lectins\n\nOf course, there are lots of foods you can eat, such as:\n\nPasture-raised, grass-fed meats and eggs\n\nWild-caught, low mercury seafood (Salmon, anchovies, haddock, sardines, and trout)\n\nFermented veggies, like kimchi and sauerkraut\n\nFruits (especially berries)\n\nDark, leafy vegetables (celery, kale, spinach, romaine lettuce)\n\nPressure-cooked legumes\n\nGood fats (olive oil, avocados, coconut, flaxseed, macadamia)\n\nYour goal should be to try and avoid the Lectin foods and eat the non-lectin foods, \u201cmost\u201d of the time. I\u2019m not here to tell you to NEVER eat this or that you \u201calways\u201d have to eat that food.\n\nIf you want to go have some food that\u2019s high in lectins, then go ahead. ENJOY the meal. Treat yourself.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel good afterward or have some digestive problems, just know that for next time and then get back to eating healthier foods.\n\nWhat\u2019s REALLY Important To Understand\n\nNow, there\u2019s one thing to all of this and that comes down to your genetics and hormones.\n\nYou can\u2019t change your genetics, but you CAN control your hormones with your lifestyle and your thoughts.\n\nMany people who are trying to lose weight and can\u2019t, blame it on their genetics. Yes, genetics does play a big role in everything.\n\nHowever, the foods you eat or don\u2019t eat can turn on or off the thousands of genetic \u201ctriggers\u201d you have in your body.\n\nFor example, IF you happen to be lectin intolerant and you eat foods that you think are \u201chealthy\u201d for you on a regular basis \u2026 but they are high in lectins, then they will trigger your \u201cfat gaining\u201d genetics to turn on.\n\nWhat you want to do is the opposite and to turn on your fat BURNING hormones and one simple way is to be mindful of today\u2019s information.\n\nHowever, if you want more details on how to turn on your fat burning genes and hormones, while also speeding up your metabolism like when you were younger, then read this article: How to Turn ON Your Fat Burning Genes.\n\nYou\u2019ll also discover why 93% of diet and exercise programs fail and how it\u2019s probably NOT your fault!\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss-se/protein-supplements-pros-and-cons/",
    "content": "Protein supplements have actually been around for decades, but until recently they were mostly thought of as added fuel for bodybuilders and top level athletes. Today, they are viewed by many as an excellent supplement to help build up muscle while being slow to digest which makes it excellent for dieting purposes.\n\nThere are many companies who have jumped on the protein supplement bandwagon and offer a wide variety of protein powders that taste far better today than in earlier times when the industry was mostly unregulated. Whey protein is the current rage in terms of supplements and they come in powder, isolates and concentrates.\n\nHowever, is the popular view of protein supplements the correct one? Actually, there are a lot of myths out there about how much protein to take and what form is the most effective.\n\nThe Pros of Protein Supplements\n\nThere are numerous benefits to adding protein to your diet as it provides the proper muscle building materials.\n\nEasy to Use: All your protein is in one bag in powder form. This means that you can mix it with milk or water for fast consumption or sprinkle the powder over your meals. Basically, you can use the powder how you see fit which makes it very convenient.\n\nQuick Absorption: When it comes to most protein supplements that can be consumed in powder or liquid form, the body will quickly absorb it through the digestive system. In fact, this is the perfect way to get in much needed protein after a workout.\n\nMore Calories: You can view this as a positive or negative, but essentially if you are interested in gaining muscle mass than the extra calories providing by the powder supplement will not be all that harmful. However, if you are actually try to lose weight and trim up then you\u2019ll need to be careful when it comes to including the excess calories in your overall diet.\n\nThe Cons of Protein Supplements\n\nAlthough it does seem like whey protein powder is particular offers very few disadvantages, there are a couple that you will need to consider starting with the extra calories that may not work for those who are strictly trying to lose weight.\n\nFiller: Many protein supplements may say \u201c100% whey protein\u201d for example, but you will want to read the ingredients to be sure. You may be surprised to find added artificial ingredients from flavoring to sweeteners and who knows what else.\n\nExpense: Most protein supplements are rather expensive for what they accomplish. It\u2019s common for many to cost upwards of $30 per pound which can really add up over time.\n\nNon-Paleo: For those who are on the Paleo diet, the powders can be considered \u201cprocessed\u201d since they use artificial sweeteners and other additives.\n\nWhether you choose to supplement your diet with protein powder will depend in large part on whether you want to spend the extra money and just how much you need the added protein. Remember that the body can only absorb so much protein at any given time so for those who only need a moderate boost, eating more lean meats, legumes or beans or even trail mix can provide you with more protein in your diet.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Burn Fat & Increase Metabolism Click HERE & Continue \u00bb Most topics on weight loss talk about the best foods to eat or avoid\u2026 or how many calories to eat and so forth.\n\nBut rarely does anyone discuss one of the most important aspects of weight loss and that\u2019s HOW you eat your food.\n\nLet me ask you something, the last time you ate anything, did you give any thought about how you CHEWED your food or how much time you spent chewing every bite?\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re like most people, including myself, probably not. And this is because chewing for most of us is done out of habit or an unconscious reflex. As soon as a piece of food enters your mouth, you chew and swallow.\n\nAnd for most of us, we chew far too quickly \u2013 especially since most of us are in a hurry to \u201ceat on the run\u201d or eat in front of the TV or computer.\n\nHowever, the way you chew your food \u2013 which is also known as \u201cmastication\u201d \u2013 and how long you spend chewing, is very important for your overall health, longevity, cravings and most importantly, WEIGHT LOSS! Simply by chewing your food longer, until it is basically a liquid in your mouth, you do three things that help your weight loss, health and longevity.\n\nThe first is that you will eat less.\n\nThe second is that you will digest and assimilate nutrients more effectively.\n\nThe third is that you will mitigate toxins and allergens from food, which are important to longevity and weight loss.\n\nChewing and Food Intake:\n\nRecent studies (Oita Medical School in Japan) show a direct relationship between chewing speed and the release of histamine from the brain. Chewing slower and longer causes the brain to release histamine, resulting in decreased food intake.\n\nThe speed at which you chew sends signals to your brain that control how much you eat.\n\nFurther, hormones such as leptin (ghrelin, cholestokinnen, etc.) that are involved in the sensation of fullness, do not reach peak expression until 20 to 40 minutes after food is ingested.\n\nChewing longer allows these hormones to work for you. You get the same sense of fullness on less food because you are giving these hormones time to work.\n\nSimply put, the more you chew, and the more slowly you chew, the less you eat. The less you eat at any given meal, the more and faster your weight loss.\n\nChewing and Digestion and Absorption\n\nEating the right foods gets you nowhere if you don\u2019t absorb them. Worse, eating the right foods takes you backwards if they turn into toxins.\n\nEating the right food is important, but eating the right food and properly digesting it is essential for lifelong and permanent weight loss.\n\nDigestion begins in your mouth, NOT in your stomach.\n\nSpecifically, saliva contains food metabolizing enzymes. Before any food you ingest even hits your stomach, it first begins breaking down in your mouth through these salivary digestive enzymes.\n\nAs you can guess, the key issue here is how long you chew your food. This is important for 2 reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that the more your chew, the more salivary digestive enzymes get released and thus, the better your food gets absorbed.\n\nRemember, at the end of the day it\u2019s all about the NUTRIENTS your body ABSORBS \u2013 nothing else!\n\nThe second reason is due to allergies. The more undigested food you have in your stomach, the more prone you are to getting food allergies.\n\nFood allergies hamper your weight loss and longevity because they cause\n\nInflammation higher blood sugar levels Gas Bloat Acidity increase in stress hormones such as cortisol etc., etc., etc.\n\nhigher blood sugar levels\n\nincrease in stress hormones such as cortisol\n\nMany people who have a difficult time with weight loss also have a difficult time with digestion and food allergies. Lack of adequate chewing is a principle reason why.\n\nIf you want faster, long-term weight loss and improved longevity, make sure you chew your food better and longer. The single most important thing you can do is to chew your food until it is basically a liquid in your mouth. By doing this you will eat less, reduce your appetite, absorb more nutrients and keep your physiology young longer by virtue of creating fewer toxins from digestion.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Burn Fat & Increase Metabolism Click HERE & Continue \u00bb Today I\u2019ve got a very important topic for anyone who has tried to lose \u201cweight\u201d and hasn\u2019t succeeded because you either:\n\nCouldn\u2019t lose the weight you wanted, no matter what you tried (it\u2019s not your fault!).\n\nYou couldn\u2019t KEEP the weight off and you gained it back eventually (and maybe MORE).\n\nYou DID lose the weight, but you did NOT end up looking the way you wanted.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve experienced any of these situations, I fully understand your confusion, frustration and even \u201canger\u201d about this because since the 6th grade (age 11), I\u2019ve been on some kind of \u201cweight loss program\u201d.\n\nDiet, exercise, supplements or \u201cweight loss fad\u201d \u2026 etc., etc.. You name it, I\u2019ve tried it (except for surgery)\n\nAnd thus, I know EXACTLY what works and more importantly, what doesn\u2019t!\n\nSo today I\u2019m just going to quickly focus on the best form of exercise for long-term and permanent fat loss and I\u2019m going to start with a recent email I received.\n\nNothing Works\u2026 I Look \u201cSkinny-Fat\u201d\n\nDr. Sam\u2026 I really need your help. I swear, I\u2019ve tried so many things to lose weight and I\u2019m so frustrated. Either nothing seems to really work long-term\u2026 Or, the end result is that I DO lose the weight, but I look sickly or way older. My friend calls me \u201cskinny-fat\u201d and I hate it! It\u2019s like I lose the weight in all the WRONG places?!!! I eat well and do at least an hour of cardio daily, what\u2019s the problem? PLEASE HELP ME!\n\nSo, this is typical because of all the MIS-information online these days.\n\nTo get right to the point and not waste your time, cardio is one of the WORST exercises to lose FAT and look good.\n\nFor example, take a look at the following images and tell me which you would rather look like:\n\nThe man on the left does lots of cardio, yet the man on the right does lots of sprinting and weightlifting.\n\nSame with the women\u2026 The left also uses weights, while on the right it\u2019s only cardio.\n\nHow To Look Younger, More Fit and Feel Healthier\n\nThe simple point of these pictures is to quickly illustrate that if you want to look better, younger and \u201cfirmer\u201d and feel healthier, it\u2019s best to FOCUS primarily on some form of \u201cresistance weight training\u201d, instead of cardio.\n\nSo here\u2019s the deal \u2013 Minute per minute, cardio indisputably burns more calories than strength training, which could explain why compared to strength trainers, aerobic exercisers lose more weight in less time, according to a recent Duke University study.\n\nLose FAT, Not \u201cWeight\u201d\n\nHowever, your goal is NOT to lose \u201cweight\u201d, you want to lose FAT!\n\nThe fact is that cardio doesn\u2019t do much for your muscles. In one Penn State study, dieters lost 21 pounds whether they performed cardio or strength training. But for the cardio group, 9 of those pounds came from valuable muscle, while the lifters lost almost pure fat and thus, gained muscle in the process.\n\nWhich means you end up looking more fit, healthier and younger. You look better in clothing, even better naked and you do NOT look \u201cskinny-fat\u201d.\n\n#1 Exercise For Building Muscle & Losing Fat\n\nAnd this is because strength training is the number-one way to build more muscle and lose fat.\n\nFor ever 1 lb of muscle you gain, you burn an extra 50 calories. If you gain 10 lbs of MUSCLE, you burn an extra 500 calories all day long, every day\u2026 even while you\u2019re sleeping.\n\nUnfortunately, cardio ONLY burns calories while you\u2019re doing the exercise. Once you stop or you miss workouts, you do NOT burn any calories.\n\nAnd without getting into all the details, cardio puts a lot of stress on your body and adrenal glands, causing NEGATIVE changing your hormones by decreasing your testosterone and growth hormones, while increasing your stress hormones, such as cortisol.\n\nThis is the OPPOSITE of what you want.\n\nIf you want to lose fat and keep the fat OFF and look even better naked, focus more on strength training and lifting weights, and LESS on cardio.\n\nPlus, if you exercise quickly with weights by keeping your rest periods to only 30-45 seconds between sets, you\u2019ll get even BETTER cardiovascular benefits for your heart and speed up fat loss.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Burn Fat & Increase Metabolism Click HERE & Continue \u00bb One of the biggest reasons people gain weight and/or can\u2019t lose it or keep it off, is because of their appetites!\n\nMany people, when they\u2019re under stress, their appetite increases due to changes in stress hormones such as cortisol. This leads to us to overeating and many times, foods that are high in sugars, carbs and fats\u2026 typically \u201cjunk\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d foods.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t your fault because these types of foods increase serotonin levels, which helps reduce stress hormones temporary.2\n\nAdditionally, Serotonin is a natural appetite suppressant.1\n\nNot Being Able To Lose Weight\n\nThis is also the same reason you can\u2019t lose weight and/or keep it off!\u2026\n\nAfter a couple weeks of dieting, your body first increases your appetite so you can EAT MORE, to prevent any further weight loss.\n\nAnd if this doesn\u2019t work, your body then slows down your metabolism to again, STOP any further weight loss.\n\nRemember, your body doesn\u2019t like change.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Point?\u2026\n\nThe point here is that it may NOT be your fault that you\u2019re unable to control your appetite at times.\n\nHowever, is it your responsibility to DO something about it and one of favorite \u201ctricks\u201d is to simply have some candy the next time you\u2019re hungry and you want to quickly kill your appetite and cravings.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not talking about eating a candybar, chocolate or Twizzlers.\n\nFor candy, I\u2019m referring to a small MINT and more specifically, it should be Peppermint flavored.\n\nAnd this because peppermint has many health benefits, but more specifically \u2013 it quickly reduces your appetite and calms your nerves and stomach pains.\n\nAnd by \u201csmall mint\u201d, I\u2019m talking about anything that\u2019s about 5 calories or less.\n\nAnd NOTHING with artificial sugars, unless it\u2019s Xylitol since it\u2019s fairly safe.\n\nHowever, I personally use something like an Altoid. One mint has only about 3 calories, less than 1 gram of sugar.\n\nIf I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019ll just slowly suck on a mint until it dissolves and that easily gives me at least an hour or two of no hunger.\n\nInstead of eating food which has many calories, this was only 5 calories. Even if you did this 10x a day, that\u2019s only 50 calories.\n\nMuch less than binging on junk food.\n\nWhat About Other Flavors Than Peppermint?\n\nIf you don\u2019t like peppermint, than other flavors can work as well. Try to stick to a \u201cmint\u201d, such as wintergreen or spearmint. Even Cinnamon flavor can work.\n\nWhat About Peppermint Gum?\n\nThe problem with gum is that the act of chewing causes an increase in stomach acids and that accelerates your hunger and increases your appetite. Maybe chewing for 5 minutes is fine, but anything over that and you\u2019ll get hungrier.\n\nPlus, most gum these days have artificial sweeteners, which is NOT good for your health and does NOT reduce your appetite the way the same amount of calories in REAL sugar does.\n\nThe next time you\u2019re hungry and want to quickly reduce your appetite and improve your stress levels, have a small peppermint Altoid. It\u2019ll prevent you from eating junk food and save you in thousands of unneeded calories, which means faster and easier weight loss.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

Otherwise, it\u2019s a total waste of space, makes you look and feel like heck and worst of all, it just seems to get worse and worse as we age.\n\nYes, some or most of it is GENETICS \u2026 but over the next few articles, I\u2019ll show you how you can work with and modify your genetics for life-long HEALTHY and PERMANENT fat loss!\n\nAnyway, I won\u2019t make much of an introduction in this first article \u2026 I know you basically want to get the \u201cshort cut secrets\u201d to losing fat, getting in shape and more importantly KEEPING the fat off, while staying healthy and happy and not deprived, fatigued or moody all the time.\n\nI\u2019ll first start off with some basic fat-loss rules with a short explanation as to HOW it works and WHY you should follow the rule. In future articles, I\u2019ll give more details for a better understanding, alternatives and a series of very useful Questions & Answers.\n\nBy the time we\u2019re done \u2026 you\u2019ll know how for 20+ years, how I\u2019ve been able to keep my private \u201ccelebrity\u201d clients and thousands of \u201cregular\u201d people in great shape, year round WITHOUT starving themselves, doing hours of grueling workouts or spending a fortune.\n\nAnyway \u2026 let\u2019s begin with the Dr. Sam\u2019s Fat Loss Rules:\n\nRule #1: Eat More OFTEN, To Burn More FAT!\n\nDon\u2019t go too long without eating something (preferably containing some protein). You should be eating every 3-4 waking hours. If you are having \u201chunger pains\u201d through out the day, chances are you aren\u2019t eating often enough.\n\nThe more often you eat, the faster your metabolism becomes because it has to WORK to digest your food. If it works 6x a day, versus only 2-3 times, you\u2019ll burn more calories and even more importantly, DIGEST your food better and hence, the calories will be directed more towards energy, repair, muscles, etc. \u2026 rather than the fat cells.\n\nAnother reason is if we wait too long to eat, most of us are so hungry that we\u2019ll pretty much eat anything in front of us that\u2019s fast and convenient and that usually translates to junk food. But by eating more often, you feel somewhat satisfied through out the day, you won\u2019t have cravings as much and when it\u2019s time to eat, you can logically choose healthier foods rather then turning into a wild animal and devouring everything in sight.\n\nAlso, when you don\u2019t eat for 5-6+ hours \u2026 your blood sugar drops and you become fatigued and can\u2019t think straight or concentrate. Then, when you begin to eat, there is a massive surge of insulin and there is a \u201crebound effect\u201d and you\u2019ll have very HIGH insulin levels, which means your food gets converted to FAT much more readily.\n\nIf you\u2019re usually only eating 2-3 meals a day, then start to add in a simple snack here and there and slowly train your body and mind to eat more often. A good snack would be something that contains both protein and carbohydrate \u2013 something like yogurt or cottage cheese or half a sandwich.\n\nOr, just cut your lunch in HALF and have one half at noon and the other half around 3 pm. Just be careful that you don\u2019t increase your TOTAL calories by having the snacks in ADDITION to all your regular sized meals.\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find a sample meal plan for two days. I\u2019ll have more specific ones in future articles. But just keep in mind that this is a sample and you would need to adjust portion sizes to fit your goals.\n\nRemember \u2013 Eat Smaller, But More Often\n\nSplit your lunch and dinner into TWO parts and basically, have 4 mini-meals. I know for some it\u2019s a hard habit, but you\u2019ll feel and look so much better! Just start slowly \u2026\n\nNow, the whole point of eating smaller, frequent meals is to speed up your metabolism, without having to decrease calories or starving yourself. Lean Optimizer works the same way, but it\u2019s just more convenient and easier to utilize.\n\nLean Optimizer is popular because it reduces your appetite, helps eliminate cravings and speeds up your metabolism, so you burn more fat (specifically around stubborn areas like waist and lower body). Try it and let me know how much fat you burn \u2026",

Ideally it would be weights + cardio\u2026 But doing ANY kind of movement daily is great (dancing, washing the car, walking, etc.). Be a kid and runaround all day =)\n\nYeah, it\u2019s true\u2026 Most people eat the most while watching TV (especially junk food). Be mindful of this and watch less TV if you can\u2019t control your eating.\n\nOr take something to reduce your appetite.\n\nDON\u2019T DRINK YOUR CALORIES\n\nIt\u2019s so easy to drink 100 calories (soda, juice, alcohol, etc.) than it is to EAT it. So drink water and eat the calories, don\u2019t drink it.\n\nLosing fat, especially after the age of 30 is much harder and it takes time, so don\u2019t give up.\n\nSet a goal \u2013 both short and long-term\u2026 Then, put in the effort daily and eventually you\u2019ll reach your goal.\n\nOf course, there are ways of accelerating your fat loss and there\u2019s a free video about it if you\u2019re interested\u2026\n\nTurn ON Your \u201cFat Burning Genes\u201d \u2013 Click To Continue \u00bb",

    "content": "Burn Fat & Increase Metabolism Click HERE & Continue \u00bb So there are lots of ways to lose weight and I think the biggest challenge with weight loss is that there are so many options. It seems that every \u201cexpert\u201d says something that makes sense and yet CONTRADICTS another \u201cexpert\u201d, right?\u2026\n\nSo, for most people the topic of weight loss typically leads to confusion and frustration.\n\nI know this because I\u2019ve been on some kind of \u201cdiet\u201d since age 11, in the 6th grade. I\u2019ve literally tried it all, multiple times.\n\nHowever, today\u2019s topic is going to be weight loss based on your BODY TYPE, which is one factor that can determine your metabolism.\n\nOther factors such as \u201cmetabolic type\u201d come into play as well, which I\u2019ll quickly cover at the end of today\u2019s article.\n\nThis is important because it\u2019s based on your genetics and hormone profile \u2013 which is one the most important factors when it comes to weight loss, how you look and feel.\n\nOne other thing before I start \u2014 your goal should NOT be to lose \u201cweight\u201d. \u2026 It should be about losing FAT, especially those stubborn areas such as belly, arms and legs.\n\nWhat\u2019s Your Body Type?\n\nSo there are 3 \u201csomatotypes\u201d or \u201cbody\u201d types. Most people are not 100% of either, but usually a blend.\n\nThe ectomorph is typically \u201ctall and skinny\u201d. They have small joints, narrow hips and shoulders and long limbs. Partly due to their fast metabolism, they have a hard time gaining weight or adding muscle to their tiny frame.\n\nBasketball players for example are typically ectomorphs, as are models.\n\nEctomorphs can typically eat a lot more food, especially carbohydrates. In fact, they have better glucose metabolism and blood sugar levels, which allows them to consume more carbohydrates WITHOUT getting fat.\n\nGenerally they also have faster metabolisms because of higher thyroid levels.\n\nFor these \u201clucky\u201d people, they don\u2019t need to lose much weight. They typically just want to lose a little fat around the belly and upper legs for women. They want to \u201ctighten\u201d up\n\nYour diet should be about 50% carbs, 25% protein, 25% fats. You can have more carbs because your body just burns through it quickly for energy.\n\nWhen trying to lose a little fat, you should reduce your calories, but NOT by much. Continue eating protein and healthy fats, but lower your simple carbohydrates.\n\nHowever you should also add in some exercise about 3-4x weekly. Keep the workouts short and intense, about 30-45 minutes. Not much is needed.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to lose valuable muscle. In fact, your best form of exercise is lifting weights to tone up and keep your shape.\n\nThese body types tend to have the best \u201cathletic\u201d genetics. They have the \u201cperfect\u201d metabolism for gaining muscle and losing fat.\n\nThey are typically fitness models or bodybuilders, wide-receivers in football for example. They have wide shoulders, narrow hips and lots of muscle and strength, with less body fat.\n\nYou need balance when it comes to fat loss. Your diet should be about 40% carbs, 40% protein, 20% fat. I would keep this ratio and simply reduce total calories.\n\nYour need both carbs and protein because of your metabolism and extra muscle.\n\nI would also add in exercise. BOTH aerobic cardio and anaerobic weight lifting, in equal amounts. You can exercise about 4-5x weekly. Keep the workouts to 45-60 min, no longer.\n\nFinally we have the \u201cbig boned\u201d endomorph who requires the most attention to detail when it comes to fat loss.\n\nYou tend to be more \u201cstocky\u201d. Narrow shoulders, wide hips. Usually shorter, thick arms and legs. You have muscle, but more fat than the 2 other body types.\n\nYou have a slower metabolism and typically don\u2019t digest carbs well. Your blood sugar shoots up too much and converts the food into fat and because of this, you need to eat less carbohydrates.\n\nSo your diet should be about 25% carbs, 50% protein and 25% fat. Make sure you have lots of vegetables and fiber, very little simple carbs.\n\nYou need less anaerobic weight lifting because you can \u201cbulk\u201d up quickly. But you need double the amount of aerobic cardio. You can workout 5-7x weekly, not more than 90 minutes at a time.\n\nThe Biggest Problem With ALL Body Types\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one thing we all have in common, which ALL 3 body types have a challenge about \u2026. the fact your body does NOT like change.\n\nIt does NOT like to lose weight, especially body fat. Thus, when you begin your \u201cfat loss journey\u201d, your body will adapt quickly by\n\nDecreasing your metabolism\n\nIncreasing your appetite\n\nDecreasing your energy levels\n\nReducing your fat-burning hormones\n\nIn fact, this is why 93% of diets and exercise programs fail in the long-run.\n\nAnd this is even more important for people over the age of 30, especially for women.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",
