    "content": "Below is a summary of the video above. I\u2019ve listed the key actionable points about how to boost your immune system and never get sick.\n\nAs mentioned in the video, if you\u2019re a man with low testosterone, you need to increase it because high testosterone = a strong immune system.\n\nI\u2019ve got lots of \u201ctestosterone boosting\u201d articles/videos if you\u2019re interested.\n\nOr if you want faster results with less effort, you can take specific testosterone-boosting herbs.\n\nLifestyle improvements can be the most challenging at times, as they often require changes to daily habits. Try to do as many of these as you can.\n\nEat a healthy, natural diet\n\nYou already know what this is. Fewer packaging and labels, the better.\n\nEat foods your great-grandmother would have eaten.\n\nDrink plenty of water. Not juice, soda, energy drinks, etc. Coffee doesn\u2019t replace water.\n\nEven if it\u2019s just walking every morning or taking a 10-15 minute walk after a meal.\n\nIdeally, you would also lift weights or do resistance exercise to build muscle, 2-4x a week. Yes, more muscle = stronger immune system.\n\nThere are stressors you can\u2019t control, so don\u2019t waste your time on such things.\n\nReduce negative media & people. They only drain you and increase your cortisol levels.\n\nTry to focus on what is RIGHT, rather than what is WRONG in life.\n\nReducing stress is difficult, I know. That\u2019s why I also take herbs that lower stress & cortisol.\n\nSleep is vital for a healthy & strong immune system.\n\nDon\u2019t ingest caffeine past noon or 2 pm.\n\nHave the same sleep schedule every night.\n\nKeep your room dark, cool and noise-free. I wear earplugs and eye shades.\n\nTake specific herbs that help you fall asleep faster & stay asleep longer.\n\nNext, you want to improve your gut health by increasing healthy bacteria.\n\nYou can take probiotic pills. If you do that, you should switch them every month from one brand to the next.\n\nEach will give you different strains of healthy bacteria.\n\nOr, you can take Natural probiotics or foods with probiotics, such as yogurt or sauerkraut.\n\nThis is what I do because I find it more beneficial and more effective. And it\u2019s also cheaper.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not as convenient as taking a probiotic pill\n\nImportant Supplements\n\nThe next thing I found to be very effective is to take specific supplements.\n\nI think vitamin C is super important. I suggest at least 1,000 to 3,000 mg daily, spread over the course of the day, taken with food.\n\nI personally take 3,000 daily, and if I feel \u201coff\u201d, I\u2019ll increase it to 5,000 mg daily.\n\nAny vitamin C brand/company is fine \u2013 it\u2019s all the same. Unless your stomach is sensitive, then you\u2019d get buffered Vitamin C.\n\nNAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine)\n\nNAC is great because it helps increase glutathione, which boosts your immune system. It\u2019s also great for healthy liver and kidney function.\n\nI suggest 500-1,000 mg daily. I take 1,000 mg daily myself. If I feel I might be getting sick, I\u2019ll double it to 2,000 mg.\n\nAny company/brand will do, it\u2019s a simple supplement.\n\nDo NOT take oral glutathione supplements because they don\u2019t get absorbed in the body.\n\nLastly and most importantly, take vitamin D3 + K2. Most people are either deficient or have sub-optimal levels.\n\nVitamin D is technically not a vitamin; it\u2019s a HORMONE. That\u2019s how powerful it is.\n\nI suggest most people take D3 at 5,000 units (125 mcg) + 50 mcg of K2 daily. I take double this dose.\n\nAnd when I feel I might be getting sick, I\u2019ll take 20,000 units for a week. It works like magic.\n\nNOTE: When taking vitamin D3 + K2, the best form is plant-based, micro-encapsulated. It\u2019s the most active, absorbable & bioavailable form. I use Perfect D3+K2\n\nThere are other supplements, such as echinacea or specific mushrooms, and so forth. But I wanted to give you the most powerful ones that also have lots of other health benefits.\n\nThe above should be taken year-round.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a man, don\u2019t forget to maximize your testosterone levels to maximize your immune system.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/why-youre-not-taller-1-reason-free-guide/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about how you can get taller.\n\nI\u2019ve made videos about this before, but today it\u2019s 2025, and I bring this up because just in the past month, I\u2019ve had two separate people ask how they can get taller. One of them is a 10-year-old, and the other is an 18-year-old.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s a lot harder when you\u2019re 18, but it got me thinking\u2026\n\nWhy Are People Taller Today?\n\nWhen I go on vacations to older civilizations outside the U.S., I notice how everything is smaller\u2014the doorways, the spaces, especially in places like the pyramids.\n\nBeing 6\u20193\u201d, I realized how much shorter people were back then.\n\nSo why are people, especially in the U.S., so much taller today?\n\nA lot of it comes down to food and nourishment.\n\nWhen people from countries like Japan or China move to the U.S., their children often grow significantly taller than them.\n\nThat\u2019s not just genetics\u2014it\u2019s about environment, diet, and overall nourishment.\n\nThe Role of Diet in Height\n\nMany kids these days don\u2019t eat well.\n\nThey eat a lot of processed foods, sugars, and cereals in the morning with little to no solid protein.\n\nTheir diets lack healthy fats (like omega-3s) and are high in omega-6s and processed oils. Plus, there are not enough fruits and vegetables that provide essential nutrients for growth.\n\nJust like a bodybuilder needs extra calories and nutrients to build muscle, a growing child needs fuel and quality nutrients to grow taller. That means:\n\nHigh-quality protein and amino acids\n\nVitamins and minerals\n\nIt\u2019s not just about eating more\u2014it\u2019s about eating better.\n\nA lot of kids are overeating but still malnourished, leading to fat gain rather than height gain. And more fat can increase estrogen levels, which may suppress height growth.\n\nThe Hidden Problems: Insulin & Activity Levels\n\nAnother major issue is insulin resistance.\n\nMany kids today are pre-diabetic or diabetic, which was rare 30\u201340 years ago. Poor insulin sensitivity lowers growth hormone and IGF levels, both of which are essential for growth.\n\nAdditionally, kids aren\u2019t moving enough.\n\nThey\u2019re indoors all day, not getting enough sunlight, which means they\u2019re deficient in Vitamin D.\n\nMovement helps your body absorb nutrients more efficiently.\n\nPhysical inactivity, poor sun exposure, and a sedentary lifestyle all impact growth potential negatively.\n\nThe Modern Growth Problem\n\nKids today are often doing all the wrong things: poor diets, little to no exercise, and low sun exposure.\n\nThis prevents them from maximizing their growth potential.\n\nCompare this to immigrant families where the next generation, with better food and lifestyle, often grows taller than their parents.\n\nFree Guide: How to Get Taller\n\nBecause of all this, I\u2019m currently putting together a free guide on how to improve your height. It will cover:\n\nWhat foods to eat and avoid\n\nWhich nutrients, vitamins, and minerals are essential\n\nHow to optimize your hormones for growth\n\nThis will help you maximize your genetic height potential, especially if you\u2019re still growing. The guide will be available soon.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to watch the other articles I\u2019ve linked and take a look at the guide when it\u2019s released.\n\nI hope this helps you or someone you care about who wants to get taller naturally and safely.",

    "title": "9 Popular Eggs MYTHS Revealed In 2025!...",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/9-popular-egg-myths-revealed/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I recently made a video entitled \u201cThe Shocking Truth About Eating Eggs\u2014Pros, Cons & Warnings,\u201d and my subscribers asked many great questions about eggs.\n\nSo, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to cover today\u2026 All \u201cegg\u201d related questions, such as:\n\nIf eggs are good or bad for your health\n\nAre they bad for cholesterol?\n\nAre they good for your hormones, such as testosterone?\n\nDo they reduce or increase inflammation?\n\nAre they good for increasing sex drive?\n\nAre they good for muscle-building?\n\nDo they cause hair loss or grow head hair?\n\nAre they a good source of protein?\n\nCan you eat them if you\u2019re diabetic or concerned about blood sugar levels?\n\nAre Eggs a Healthy Food?\n\nI think they are very healthy for most people.\n\nHowever, some people shouldn\u2019t eat them and I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\nWhole eggs are a great source of protein and healthy fats. They contain vitamins and minerals like B Vitamins, A, D, E, choline, iron, and selenium.\n\nThey\u2019re easy to cook in different ways, and you can even hard-boil and travel with them. They\u2019re also typically easy to digest \u2014 as long as they aren\u2019t combined with processed or junky foods.\n\nEggs are also a better value than many protein sources, although prices have increased recently.\n\nThe only downside is that some people are allergic to eggs or can develop sensitivities over time if eaten daily.\n\nSuggested intake: About a dozen eggs per week. For example, 3 eggs, 4x a week. Consider taking occasional breaks every few months.\n\nAre Eggs Bad for Cholesterol Levels?\n\nThe yolk contains all the fat and has about 200 mg of cholesterol per large egg.\n\nAbout 35% of the yolk is saturated fat. But the majority is 40% monounsaturated fats and 25% polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3s.\n\nLatest research shows that dietary cholesterol does NOT raise blood cholesterol or increase risk for heart disease in most people.\n\nIn fact, your body produces 80% of its cholesterol through the liver \u2014 it\u2019s not mostly from food.\n\nHigh cholesterol on blood tests is usually the result of aging and hormonal changes, not eggs.\n\nAre Eggs Good for Your Hormones?\n\nYes, because the yolk contains cholesterol, which is a precursor to sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen.\n\nCholesterol is technically a steroid (a sterol) and shares the same structure as many hormones.\n\nPeople with low cholesterol, especially those on statins, often have lower testosterone levels.\n\nPersonally, when I eat 2\u20133 eggs at night, I notice more morning erections. Just something to consider.\n\nAre Eggs Inflammatory?\n\nAnti-inflammatory benefits:\n\nCholine helps reduce inflammation markers\n\nLutein and zeaxanthin are antioxidants with anti-inflammatory effects\n\nPhospholipids may reduce inflammation\n\nPossible pro-inflammatory concerns:\n\nArachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, can turn pro-inflammatory in certain cases\n\nTMAO, produced from choline by gut bacteria, may contribute to inflammation in some people\n\nBut overall, the research shows that eggs are more anti-inflammatory than pro-inflammatory.\n\nThe cooking method matters\u2014frying eggs with bacon and processed carbs makes the meal inflammatory, not the eggs themselves.\n\nDo Eggs Increase Your Sex Drive?\n\nYes \u2014 as mentioned earlier, cholesterol helps produce testosterone, which boosts sex drive and erections.\n\nAre Eggs Good for Muscle Building?\n\nIn the 50s\u201370s, bodybuilders consumed lots of eggs and red meat. Here\u2019s why:\n\nHigh-quality protein: 7g per egg, complete with all essential amino acids\n\nHigh bioavailability: Egg protein is almost 100% absorbable\n\nRich in leucine: A key amino acid for muscle growth\n\nCholesterol: Needed for testosterone production\n\nAdditional nutrients for muscle function: choline, iron, B12, vitamin D\n\nAre Eggs Good for Hair Growth?\n\nYes. Eggs provide protein, which your skin and hair need, along with:\n\nOmega-3s (in pasture-raised eggs)\n\nAre Eggs a Good Source of Protein?\n\nYes. Eggs are a complete protein with all essential amino acids in both the yolk and white.\n\nProtein quality (biological value):\n\nBodybuilders have relied on eggs for decades \u2014 and for good reason.\n\nAre Eggs Good for Diabetics?\n\nYes, eggs are great for people with diabetes and blood sugar concerns:\n\nLow in carbohydrates: Only 0.5g per egg \u2014 basically no sugar\n\nHigh in protein and fat: Helps stabilize blood sugar and reduce cravings\n\n7g of protein per egg: Supports satiety and improved insulin sensitivity\n\nThe combination of low carbs, high protein and fat makes eggs a smart option for anyone trying to manage blood sugar.\n\nSo there you have it \u2014 the wonderful and perfect egg. It\u2019s one of my favorite foods.\n\nRemember, whole eggs are better than just egg whites. While the yolks contain fat and calories, they also contain most of the nutrients and essential amino acids.\n\nYou can still make an egg white omelet \u2014 just add 1 or 2 yolks to preserve the full health benefits.",

    "content": "I think most people should take some form of fish oil because of all the amazing health benefits it provides.\n\nPlus, most of us are not eating enough fatty fish like salmon or sardines, which are rich in EPA and DHA omega-3s.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll quickly share the best and worst times to take your fish oil so you can get the most out of it.\n\nAlways Take Fish Oil With Food\n\nFish oil should be taken with a meal that contains fat to increase absorption.\n\nBest Time to Take Fish Oil\n\nThe best time to take fish oil is later in the day with your evening meal.\n\nThis is because omega-3s are linked to:\n\nStress and anxiety reduction\n\nDHA is involved in the production of melatonin \u2014 the hormone that regulates your sleep-wake cycle.\n\nA higher intake of omega-3s helps your body naturally produce more melatonin, improving your ability to fall and stay asleep.\n\nLikewise, DHA supports serotonin production and regulation, which promotes calmness and relaxation.\n\nWorst Time to Take Fish Oil\n\nSince fish oil and omega-3s help reduce inflammation, the worst time to take them is right after exercise.\n\nWhy? Because when you exercise and lift weights, your body produces inflammation \u2014 and this is actually a good thing.\n\nThis natural inflammation triggers your body to start healing, repairing, and building new muscle tissue.\n\nTaking anti-inflammatory supplements like fish oil, curcumin, or ginger immediately after a workout may reduce this natural growth response.\n\nThis also includes avoiding anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or Advil right after training.\n\nSo When Should You Take Fish Oil?\n\nI\u2019ve shared what I believe is the best and most effective time \u2014 with your evening meal.\n\nHowever, in the big picture, the most important thing is to take it consistently.\n\nIf needed, you can split the dose \u2014 take half in the morning with breakfast and the other half with dinner.\n\nJust make sure each meal includes some fat to help with absorption.\n\nWhatever is easiest and most convenient for you is what matters most.\n\nThat\u2019s why I suggest taking your full dose of fish oil with your evening meal \u2014 simple, effective, and easy to remember.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/are-carbs-toxic-and-killing-your-brain/",
    "content": "For the past few years, people are back on another \u201cfad\u201d diet which is the Ketogenic diet, a very high-fat, almost no carbohydrate diet.\n\nNow, there are various doctors and \u201cexperts\u201d stating that we all need to stop eating carbs because they are toxic to the brain, they can cause inflammation, which can lead to neurological conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, depression, and others.\n\nThey are all stating how we, as humans, are NOT meant to eat carbs and we are designed to eat a high fat, higher protein diet.\n\nAnd you know what, there\u2019s some truth to what these people are saying, so that\u2019s the good news. However, there are also a lot of incorrect assumptions as well because of poor research.\n\nBasically, the research is taken out of context.\n\nFor example, the author will say how in a study people who ate a high-fat diet look, feel, and function better. However, the author leaves out the part about how the people in the study ALSO STOPPED eating junk and processed foods and made other lifestyle improvements.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to simplify this whole subject for you because there was a time that I was also a bit confused.\n\nIf you want to live longer, have better mental health, increase your energy levels, and help avoid many diseases \u2013 then continue reading\u2026\n\nFirst of all, I just hate extremes of any kind.\n\nThey never work long-term and are always full of problems and imbalances.\n\nI don\u2019t like people saying you have to eat a very high-fat diet/no-carb diet (Ketogenic) \u2026 Or those on the other opposite side saying you need high carbs, no fats\u2026 Or those saying you have to have a high protein diet.\n\nSome of the healthiest people on this planet eat very high-carb diets and this includes Asians, who historically live the longest and have had the least health problems.\n\nOnly a small group of people, such as the Eskimos, do well on very high-fat, ketogenic diets.\n\nFor sure your brain needs fat, but it also likes carbs. However, your body and muscles for sure prefer carbs and glucose.\n\nThere are no athletes winning events or sustaining any long-term exercise plans on no-carb diets.\n\nYour body AND brain require fats AND carbs AND proteins.\n\nWhat matters is the TYPE of foods you eat.\n\nFor example, I have a very well-known friend of mine, who is also one of these \u201cfitness experts\u201d.\n\nHe\u2019s been on a high-fat, ketogenic diet for the past year and has lost weight, looks much better, and is now coming out with a book about this topic.\n\nHowever, I go over to his home and he\u2019s eating fried bacon, chicken, and other fried meats.\n\nAll he cares about is \u201cno carbs\u201d.\n\nBut how in the world is eating fried foods healthy for you?\u2026 IT\u2019S NOT!\n\nOur ancestors never ate like this, so why is it okay now?\n\nAlso, this \u201cfamous\u201d friend of mine who is coming out with this book, \u2026 ALSO started exercising again, optimized his hormones with supplements, and also stopped drinking alcohol.\n\nBut, he\u2019s leaving all of that OUT of the book he\u2019s writing.\n\nUse Common Sense Please\n\nI know common sense doesn\u2019t seem to be too common these days, but please just stop for a moment and ask yourself if \u201cthis makes sense\u201d?\n\nMost people, including the experts, \u201cfollow the FOLLOWER\u201d\u2026 instead of \u201cfollow the LEADER\u201d!\n\nSince today\u2019s topic is about \u201cbrain health\u201d improving your memory and preventing neurological conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, depression, and others\u2026 let me tell you what you should consider doing:\n\nEat healthy fats. Eat coconut oil, macadamia and extra virgin olive oil, flaxseed oil (without lignans), avocados, walnuts, raw seeds, and similar, natural fats.\n\nDon\u2019t heat fats. It changes the structure.\n\nDon\u2019t heat junky, fake, toxic, cheap fats that are high in inflammatory Omega 6 fats, such as sunflower, corn, soybean and cottonseed oils. NO margarine ever.\n\nGo ahead and eat carbs, but eat healthy and natural carbs such as vegetables, small amounts of fruits, white rice, yams, legumes (cooked in a pressure cooker), quinoa, millet and some oats.\n\nStay away from syrups, man-made carbs that come in a box (chips, pretzels, crackers, bread, etc.), and any liquid carbs (NO fruit juice, drinks, sodas, etc.)\n\nThe lower your body fat and the more you exercise, the more carbs you get to eat.\n\nYou also need some protein, but most people eat way too much.\n\nEat healthy proteins such as pasture-raised whole eggs, bison, beef, and small amounts of chicken. For fish, low mercury is best \u2013 such as wild-caught Salmon.\n\nYou can also go all vegetarian protein if you\u2019d like, that\u2019s great as well. These days there are lots of good, vegetarian protein powders. Try a few and see which you like. Just make sure there are no added sugars, syrups, fake sugars, etc.\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget to exercise. Lifting weights is great. But simply walking daily is fantastic. I suggest taking a short, 10 min walk after each meal. It helps with digestion, improves insulin sensitivity and lowers stress hormones.\n\nMost of us are deficient in nutrients, no matter how great we eat.\n\nThe way foods are produced these days, the depleted soil and so forth \u2013 you must take additional supplements, vitamins, herbs, and amino acids that are proven to improve brain health.\n\nThere are lots of good ones, but if you\u2019re interested in the most effective, I\u2019ve put a link below to a list of the best nutritional supplements for improving your brain health and increasing energy levels.\n\nAnd lastly, yet most importantly \u2013 you need to manage your stress levels and your THOUGHTS. This is a big topic and it\u2019s hard for most people to grasp.\n\nBut I know for a fact that those people who are negative, complaining, critical, unhappy, envious, jealous, and constantly have negative thoughts and emotions, are always the ones who get sick, and have cancers and other diseases.\n\nTry your best to be happy \u2013 it takes work, just as it takes effort to be negative.\n\nSmile more. Give compliments. Be hopeful. Be grateful and have an \u201cattitude of gratitude\u201d.\n\nThings may not be going the way you want at this moment, but trust me \u2013 things can be a lot worse as well.\n\nEither way, whatever problems you\u2019re dealing with will eventually work out.\n\nYour thoughts, feelings, and emotions will either create HEALING or DESTRUCTIVE hormones!\n\nIt\u2019s up to you. YOU control your thoughts and actions.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/high-blood-sugar-kills-testosterone-immediately-new-clinical-study/",
    "content": "In my past articles, I\u2019ve mentioned lots of different ways for you to improve your testosterone levels. However, today it\u2019s 2025, and I want to focus on something that I haven\u2019t spent as much time on, which is your blood sugar levels.\n\nThis is important for anyone concerned about their hormone levels, gaining muscle, losing fat, and also wanting to avoid or fix erectile problems.\n\nSimply stated, bad blood sugar levels can immediately kill your testosterone levels by 25% or more. Plus, this massive drop in testosterone, can last as long as 4-5 hours before things go back to normal.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re eating multiple meals daily, with the wrong TYPE and QUANTITY for foods\u2026 and thus, bad blood sugar levels with each meal \u2014 then your testosterone levels will not only drop by 25% or more, but they\u2019ll STAY LOWER most of the day.\n\nYou obviously don\u2019t want this and in a minute I\u2019ll give you 3 simple ways to fix this, naturally and you can get started immediately today.\n\nHowever, there are also indirect ways blood sugar problems can further decrease your testosterone.\n\nFirst of all, blood sugar problems and the increase in insulin levels will also lead to fat storage \u2013 especially belly fat.\n\nThe more body fat you have, the more estrogen your body will produce \u2013 for both men and women. And when estrogen goes up, testosterone comes down!\n\nSo, now that\u2019s TWO ways your testosterone has dropped because of higher blood sugar levels.\n\nOver time, you\u2019ll also become more \u201cinsulin resistant\u201d with the consistently elevated blood sugar levels. This means your body will produce even MORE insulin and thus, leading to even higher body fat, which means what?\u2026\n\nYES, even lower testosterone levels all day long.\n\nAnd if all of this wasn\u2019t bad enough, you\u2019ll start to lose muscle in the process \u2013 even if you\u2019re still working out.\n\nOne last thing just to ruin your day even more \u2014 blood sugar problems and bad insulin levels also cause damage to the nerves and blood vessels over time, decrease blood flow, and cause what every man fears \u2013 erectile dysfunction and impotence.\n\nIn fact, this is one of the biggest complaints from diabetic men \u2013 they can\u2019t get or maintain erections.\n\n3 Simple Ways To Have Healthy Blood Sugar & Increase Testosterone\n\nSo that\u2019s the bad news. Now let\u2019s get to the good news.\n\nYou do NOT need to go super low carbs.\n\nNor do you need to go on a ketogenic diet, which has its own set of problems, including lower testosterone and thyroid levels over time.\n\nHere are 3 very simple things you can do daily, that will naturally keep your blood sugar levels in a healthy range and thus, NOT drop your testosterone levels.\n\nDon\u2019t Drink Your Calories\n\nFirst off, do NOT drink your calories. This means no soda, juices, green drinks, energy drinks, or alcohol. Read the labels.\n\nThese are filled with simple sugars and carbs. They digest quickly and thus, spike up your blood sugar and insulin levels immediately.\n\nDrink only water, tea, and coffee, without anything added. Again, read the labels and look for the carbs and sugar content.\n\nYou also need to move more and exercise daily. Your muscles use glucose and thus, energy. The more muscle you have, the better your insulin sensitivity and thus, less blood sugar spikes even with big carb meals.\n\nSo make sure you lift weights, 3-4x weekly. Even if it\u2019s just your body weight \u2013 like squats, pull-ups, and push-ups.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one thing everyone can do at any age, any time of the day, anywhere, and that\u2019s walking.\n\nSimply walking 10-15 minutes before or after a meal, dramatically drops your blood sugar levels, lowers the stress hormone cortisol, and thus, keeps your testosterone up.\n\nIn fact, these mini-walks are more effective than a long 30-minute walk. Plus, it\u2019s not as boring. Listen to something positive make a phone call or just enjoy nature.\n\nLastly, if you want something that\u2019s even easier to do, simply take a few key supplements that will support healthy blood sugar levels, increase insulin sensitivity, AND improve your A1C levels \u2014 all at the same time.\n\nHerbs such as Berberine, Cinnamon Extract, Bitter Melon Extract, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vanadyl, Chromium, and a few others, actually work BETTER than many prescription drugs, without any side effects and are good for your health and longevity.\n\nI\u2019ve listed a couple of important links. One listing the best, clinically proven ingredients you can use.\n\nAnother link leads to a formula that I use myself daily you can copy the same formula for yourself, and you\u2019ll support healthy blood sugar levels the same day while improving your testosterone and overall health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m going to reveal a super easy way to quickly reduce your appetite and blood sugar levels, with NO change in your diet or exercise program. You\u2019ll lose fat, have more energy, and be in a better mood.\n\nYou\u2019ll live longer too\u2026\n\nAnd the best part is you can keep eating the same foods, yes\u2026 this even means your yummy carbohydrates.\n\nHardest Part About Losing Weight\n\nNow, the unfortunate truth is that one of the hardest parts about losing weight is dealing with your appetite.\n\nMost people trying to lose fat, just want to eat and are hungry. The cause can be due to emotions, stress, physical hunger, hormonal changes, or just genetics.\n\nOf course, genetics aside, hormones play a huge role in your appetite and weight loss.\n\nFor example, when stress hormones such as cortisol go up, blood sugar goes up, more insulin gets secreted and then blood sugar drops dramatically and next thing you know, you\u2019re hungry all the time and you\u2019re craving unhealthy carbs and sugars.\n\nThis why even one or two bad nights of sleep, shoot up cortisol and blood sugar and you just end up craving food all day long, especially carbs.\n\nThis is also why we tend to crave more sugars and carbs at the end of the day, you\u2019re just more stressed out, tired, frustrated, and so forth.\n\nWomen feel this even more during their menstrual cycles \u2013 big hormonal fluctuations, cause changes in neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, they get super hungry and crave carbs and also chocolate and even wine.\n\nGuys with low testosterone and higher estrogen levels, also end up eating more junk.\n\nKeep Your Blood Sugar Stable\n\nThe bottom line is managing your hormones, more specifically your insulin, and thus, keeping your blood sugar stable.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the goal, we want to reduce blood sugar highs and lows.\n\nThe Easiest \u201cTrick\u201d To Lose Weight\n\nHowever, today I want to reveal one of the easiest tricks for lowering your blood sugar by almost 70%.\n\nBest of all, it requires ZERO change in your diet, no supplements, no exercise\u2026 absolutely nothing except a change in the order of the foods you eat.\n\nSo, when eating a meal \u2013 you typically have proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. There\u2019s also one other food \u201cgroup\u201d and that\u2019s fiber, which most people don\u2019t get enough of.\n\nAnd, here\u2019s today\u2019s tip \u2013 when eating your meals, eat your foods in the following order of importance:\n\nBasically, you\u2019ll eat your carbohydrates at the very end of the meal.\n\nIronically, several studies have shown that most people eat carbohydrates FIRST and vegetables last, if they even eat vegetables.\n\nNow, this simple change in order does two main things\u2026\n\nFirst, it can help lower your blood sugar spikes by up to 70%. This is huge because this alone will help reduce your appetite, hunger, and cravings.\n\nSecond, because you\u2019ve changed the order of your foods and eating the vegetables and protein first, you\u2019ve filled up your stomach with lower calorie, higher density foods, especially fiber from vegetables.\n\nBoth of which quickly release satiety hormones. These are hormones that make you feel full, rather than hungry.\n\nThis causes most people to not finish the entire meal and thus, some of the high-calorie carbs don\u2019t get eaten because they are partially FULL by the time they start eating the carbohydrates.\n\nThis means fewer calories ingested and faster fat loss.\n\nHowever, the studies show that even if you eat the entire meal as usual, the simple change in the order of macronutrients, still causes weight loss, better blood sugar levels, and dramatically lower appetite.\n\nAdd specific vitamins and herbs, such as those found in Blood Sugar Optimizer, and you\u2019ll see even better & faster results.\n\nDo this daily and consistently and you\u2019re guaranteed healthy weight loss & blood sugar levels.\n\nMore importantly, a fat loss that you keep off long-term because you\u2019re not dieting or depriving yourself, you\u2019re just changing the order of the foods eaten.\n\nThe only challenge here is to make this a new, daily habit.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s going to be difficult at first. But do it a bunch of times, and you\u2019ll look & feel better, have more energy, and then you\u2019ll just want to do it all the time because of the positive results.\n\nSimple, easy\u2026 and yet, extremely effective and scientifically proven\u2026\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/discover-the-best-worst-fruits-to-eat-avoid/",
    "content": "So, I\u2019ll be honest with you \u2013 I just love fruit. But it wasn\u2019t always like that.\n\nI remember being very young and drinking Coca-Cola in crushed ice on a hot summer day. It was awesome, tasted yummy, and was refreshing.\n\nMy mom would tell me to not drink cola \u2026 it\u2019s not good for your teeth. Of course, there was no mention of it being bad for my health, just my teeth.\n\nShe then sliced up some apple wedges and gave me a slice. I remember thinking, \u201cyuck, this is horrible.\u201d\n\nOf course, compared to the addictive and super sweet qualities of cola, natural fruit didn\u2019t taste as good.\n\nNow that I\u2019m older (and wiser), things are different.\n\nI bring up today\u2019s topic because both soda and an apple (or most fruits) contain fruit sugar called \u2013 FRUCTOSE.\n\nHowever, each reacts very differently in the body \u2013 the soda vs fruit.\n\nOne of them should NEVER be consumed and the other can be consumed, but in limited amounts and preferably during certain times of the year.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started\u2026\n\nPros & Cons Of Fructose (Fruit Sugar)\n\nMany people will tell you that it\u2019s okay to have fruit. It\u2019s natural. Plus, as an added bonus, fructose \u2013 the sugar found in fruits \u2013 has a lower glycemic index than most carbohydrates and thus, does NOT raise your blood sugar levels.\n\nHowever, excessive consumption of fructose does end up putting a burden on the liver.\n\nIn fact, some research has shown that fructose is processed in the small intestine. When too much is consumed, it spills over into the liver.1\n\nBecause it\u2019s now believed that fructose can be a toxin and that\u2019s why it goes to the liver, your body\u2019s natural detoxifying filter.\n\nThe liver can only hold or store a certain amount of fructose, which I\u2019ll tell you in a minute.\n\nAnd once over that amount, it gets converted into fat.\n\nUnlike other carbohydrates that are glucose-based, which can be stored in your muscles. And, if you exercise and have lots of muscle, you can obviously store and thus, eat a lot more glucose and regular carbs.\n\nSo, even though fructose is natural and has a low glycemic index, it can make you fat and can increase your risk for:\n\nElevated triglycerides\n\nIncrease in cholesterol\n\nHigher blood pressure\n\nBut again, don\u2019t worry\u2026 certain fruits are okay to eat, especially in specific amounts.\n\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup\n\nMany packaged foods, especially sodas, contain High Fructose Corn Syrup. This is not natural. It\u2019s man-made.\n\nIt\u2019s a very highly concentrated source of sugar made of fructose, which is the sugar found in fruits.\n\nTo make a long story short because I just don\u2019t really care to bore you with all the medical and scientific jargon \u2013 you should AVOID all syrups.\n\nHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS) \u2013 this is everywhere, it\u2019s cheap and bad\n\nAgave syrup \u2013 yes, this is very bad for you and contains even more fructose than HFCS\n\nHoney \u2013 raw honey in small amounts is okay\n\nSo no syrups. Read the labels.\n\nWhy Fruit Is Different\n\nThe main issue with all of these syrups is that it\u2019s dense and full of calories and it takes little time to consume them. Thus, it immediately overloads your body. This is NOT natural.\n\nHowever, fruits are different.\n\nSure, fruits have some fructose sugar, but it\u2019s also full of water, fiber, antioxidants, polyphenols, vitamins, and other healthy nutrients.\n\nIt also takes time to eat fruit, chew and digest it.\n\nThis is all good, it\u2019s natural.\n\nDifferent Fruits \u2013 Different Benefits \u2013 Pros & Cons\n\nOf course, not all fruit is the same or has the same benefits.\n\nCertain fruits should be avoided:\n\nFruit juice \u2013 yes, again, this is highly concentrated calories, lacking in fiber. EAT the fruit, not only the juice.\n\nDried fruit \u2013 it\u2019s lacking the 2 most important parts of the fruit, water and some fiber. Plus, it\u2019s not fresh and thus, many of the valuable nutrients have been killed off.\n\nJams \u2013 again, very highly concentrated. Usually contains added sugars.\n\nCanned fruits \u2013 not natural, preservatives, added sugars, lacking nutrients, etc.\n\nBerries \u2013 most berries are really good to eat. Blackberries, cranberries, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and so forth, including cherries. The thin skin allows more nutrients to be created from the sun. It also allows more toxins and pesticides to enter, so make sure it\u2019s organic.\n\nMelons \u2013 these have lots of water, and are typically lower in calories because of it. Watermelon, cantaloupes, honeydew, etc.\n\nGrapefruit and lemons are great. Again, super low in calories.\n\nOranges have benefits as well.\n\nGreen plantains and bananas are good, because they have much lower sugar content, even though they don\u2019t taste as good as the yellow ones.\n\nApples and pears are okay to eat in small amounts. But make sure they are organic especially the apples. Lots of pesticides are used on apples and they have grown in size over the past few decades and thus, more sugar.\n\nPineapples, grapes, ripened/yellow bananas/plantains, and mangoes are some of my favorite fruits. They taste the best because they have the most amount of sugar. These for sure need to be limited.\n\nFruit should be eaten like dessert. I actually suggest you have a piece of fruit if you\u2019re craving something sugary or in between meals if you\u2019re hungry and you want to kill your appetite. It won\u2019t raise your blood sugar much and it\u2019ll keep you going. It\u2019s also easy to digest.\n\nAn ideal time to eat fruit would be after exercise when your liver has been depleted of some of the fructose and thus, you can fill it up a little without it spilling over and converting to fat.\n\nYou should also eat fruits that are in season. Thus, have watermelon during the summer. Granted, these days, any and all fruits seem to be in season and available at your local supermarket. But seasonal fruits would be ideal.\n\nHow Much Fruit To Eat\n\nAnd finally, how much fruit should you eat? \u2026 I suggest no more than 25 grams of fructose daily. Which is about 100 calories.\n\nPersonally, I do notice that when I have more fruit, I do start to gain more body fat. Maybe due to me eating more calories or just higher fructose, I\u2019m not sure.\n\nNevertheless, I suggest you limit your fructose and only eat it as a treat, like a dessert.\n\nHope this article was helpful. I\u2019ve also done an article about vegetables \u2013 which to eat and avoid.\n\nhttp://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(17)30729-5",

    "content": "Unfortunately, as we age, our arteries get more clogged, they get smaller and blood flow is reduced throughout your entire body.\n\nThe good news is that with the right diet, exercise, and specific supplements, you can definitely improve, reverse, and prevent clogged arteries.\n\nAnd today I\u2019m going to reveal the 5 best, clinically backed foods that will help you and me achieve our healthy arterial goals, regardless of your age.\n\nBerries (blueberries, strawberries, cranberries, raspberries, and blackberries) may help prevent clogged arteries by supporting a healthy inflammatory response.\n\nThey also prevent cholesterol accumulation, improve artery function, and protect against cellular damage.\n\nCitrus fruits (oranges, lemons, limes, and similar fruits) \u2013 Citrus flavonoids can support a healthy inflammatory response and help prevent free radicals in the body from oxidizing LDL (bad) cholesterol. Oxidized LDL is associated with atherosclerosis development and progression.\n\nEating cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower may help reduce your chances of developing clogged arteries.\n\nThese types of vegetables work by lowering carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), which is a measurement to assess a person\u2019s risk of atherosclerosis-related disease.\n\nBeets are another great vegetable because they are a rich source of nitrates, which your body converts to nitric oxide.\n\nThis helps dilate and improve blood vessel function and support healthy inflammatory response, both of which may help prevent atherosclerosis.\n\nGreen leafy vegetables such as lettuces, kale, arugula, Swiss chard, and spinach are also good sources of dietary nitrates, which can help improve blood vessel function and reduce inflammation.\n\nIn fact, multiple clinical studies have shown that you can reduce your risk of heart disease by a whopping 16% by eating these greens daily.\n\nFatty Fish For Healthy Arteries\n\nFatty fish \u2013 such as mackerel, salmon, sardines, herring, and small amounts of tuna\u2014are rich in healthy fats, which can help to clear the arteries.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids help to increase the \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol while reducing triglyceride levels, decreasing blood vessel inflammation, and the formation of blood clots in the arteries. They can even lower blood pressure.\n\nAll you need is 2 servings a week. If you don\u2019t like fish, at least take a minimum of 3 grams of fish oil daily.\n\nHealthy Fats For Clean Arteries\n\nSpeaking of healthy fats, you need to add in more fish oils, olive oil, and avocados because of the higher omega-3 and monounsaturated fats.\n\nHowever, you for sure want to reduce the inflammatory and unhealthy seed oil fats such as canola, corn, cottonseed, sunflower, and safflower oil \u2013 which is primarily found in packaged foods.\n\nFiber has numerous benefits for your entire body \u2013 including your heart, arteries, gut, and colon. Sadly, most of us are NOT eating enough fiber.\n\nSo try to add in more fiber-rich foods such as beans, flax seeds, Oats, and small amounts of nuts and seeds such as walnuts and almonds.\n\nAt the very least, make sure you add in some fiber pills if you\u2019re not going to eat such foods.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve got more simple and easy shortcuts for healthy arteries and blood flow.\n\nBut at the very least, try to add in some of the foods I suggested today.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30092632/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6431442/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5627698/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6015430/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575935/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4973479/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802750/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18420395/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707742/",

    "content": "This article continues with my multi-part series about the \u201c10 Biggest Myths & Lies About Weight Loss\u201d with myth #2, that \u201cCarbs Make You Fat\u201d\n\nBefore I start, remember \u2014 your goal is not to \u201close weight\u201d. Instead, you want to burn stubborn body fat, while keeping your valuable muscle. Let\u2019s continue\u2026\n\nYes, it\u2019s true that \u201clow-carb\u201d diets help with weight loss.1, 2 And this is partly true because:\n\nCarbs make you retain more water, so the \u201cweight\u201d you lose, is initially just water weight and thus, it doesn\u2019t really count. It\u2019s not FAT loss, just \u201cweight\u201d loss.\n\nBy eating fewer carbs, most people just end up eating less food and calories, especially the processed, \u201cyummy\u201d foods that are generally high in carbohydrates. So again, it\u2019s not specifically because of eating fewer carb calories that you lose weight.\n\nThe Reality About Weight Loss\n\nThe truth is that simply eating fewer calories will help anyone lose weight initially.\n\nWhat you want is long-term FAT loss. You don\u2019t want to lose \u201cweight\u201d which is water weight or worse, muscle loss. So, let\u2019s make this very clear.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT \u201cCarbs\u201d, But Insulin!\n\nHowever, carbohydrates do NOT make you fat, it\u2019s high insulin levels that cause the fat gain.\n\nInsulin gets secreted in high amounts when your blood sugar goes up \u2026\n\nAnd what happens when you eat refined sugars, processed carbs and basically, high glycemic/load foods.\n\nGlycemic Index & Load\n\nFor example, 200 calories of corn flakes, has a very high glycemic index AND load, the same as table sugar \u2013 which is 100. That\u2019s the highest!\n\nSo, your blood sugar goes up dramatically, your body then secretes lots of insulin to help lower the high blood sugar back to normal \u2026 and now the foods can get STORED as body fat more quickly.\n\nYet, the same 200 calories from beans have a much lower glycemic index/load, which is about 35.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a much lower rise in blood sugar and insulin and thus, the food isn\u2019t stored as body fat as readily.\n\nThis is even MORE true as we age and don\u2019t do well with sugar and insulin sensitivity.\n\nYou can also take specific herbs with your carb meals, that help lower your blood sugar levels.\n\nAgain, what matters is the TYPE of carbs, not just total carbohydrates.\n\nIn fact, very low-carb diets lead to a slowing of your thyroid production and thus, slower metabolism.\n\nSo, eat healthy carbs that have a lower glycemic index/load, which won\u2019t increase your insulin levels, such as:\n\nOf course, total calories still matter \u2013 so don\u2019t overdo it.\n\nAnd if you want faster results, you can take specific herbs that increase your fat-burning hormones and decrease belly fat.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2007.02290.x/full\n\nhttp://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/jc.2002-021480",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/5-best-clinically-proven-ways-to-improve-your-eyesight-vision/",
    "content": "As you age, your body starts to fall apart.\n\nHormones decline Skin wrinkles Libido drops Hair thins Memory problems Hearing declines And vision problems, which is what I want to write about today.\n\nOf course, genetics plays a big role in everything.\n\nHowever, most of these problems can be reversed or most certainly slowed down, if you take the proper preventive measures. This is especially important if you don\u2019t have the best eye genetics.\n\nAnd the sooner you start, the better the results and the higher the chance of potentially reversing, avoiding, or slowing down the progressive decline of these age-related problems.\n\nAnd with that said, I want to quickly reveal the 5 Best, Clinically Proven Ways To Improve Your Eyesight & Vision.\n\n1 \u2013 Eat Specific Foods & Take Your Supplements\n\nMost of us don\u2019t eat the perfect diet filled with a variety of fresh, organic foods, vegetables, and fruits. So you should consider taking supplements that have been shown to help reduce eye degeneration and enhance your vision, especially at night.\n\nVitamins & Minerals For Eyesight\n\nVitamins A (and beta-carotene), C, and E, as well as the mineral zinc, contain antioxidants that can help reduce macular degeneration. It is a condition in which the macula \u2014 the part of the eye that controls central vision \u2014 deteriorates.\n\nMake sure you take additional amounts of these supplements.\n\nPlus, add in food sources that contain healthy amounts of these nutrients, which can be found in:\n\nYou\u2019ll notice there are a variety of colors with these foods, which is key.\n\nFish Oil For Eyesight\n\nTake your omega-3 fatty acids as well. I suggest about 2-6 grams daily.\n\nGood food sources would be salmon, flaxseed, and also Krill oil.\n\nCarotenoids For Eyesight\n\nI also suggest taking carotenoids, such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin.\n\nCarotenoids are found in the retina of your eyes. These carotenoids help protect the macula by improving pigment density in that part of the eye and absorbing ultraviolet and blue light.\n\nThat last bit is especially important, considering how much you\u2019re bombarded with unnatural blue light these days (fluorescent/LED lighting, computer, and phone screens, etc.).\n\n2 \u2013 Support Healthy Blood Sugar\n\nThis is a major topic in itself.\n\nThis is especially important if you\u2019re overweight. This is because high blood sugar causes damage to the tiny blood vessels in your eyes.\n\nSo, make sure you eat well, exercise, and take supplements that help lower your blood sugar and improve your insulin sensitivity.\n\n3 \u2013 Support Healthy Blood Pressure\n\nAnother chronic health condition that causes eye damage, in addition to blood sugar problems, is high blood pressure.\n\nBoth high blood sugar & pressure cause inflammation of the optic nerve, which can cause pain, poor eyesight especially night vision, and can even lead to complete vision loss if not treated.\n\n4 \u2013 Healthy Cholesterol Levels\n\nHigh AND low cholesterol are both linked to cataracts. Even more so, toxic statin drugs, which are prescribed for cholesterol, are ALSO linked to cataracts.1\n\nHigh blood sugar is also linked to cataracts.\n\nA cataract is a clouding of the eye\u2019s lens. Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness among people older than 55.\n\nMost older people have some degree of lens clouding, which is a normal part of aging.\n\nBoth my mom and two of my uncles have it. It\u2019s painless, but it can certainly lead to poor vision and blindness.\n\nSo, make sure your cholesterol levels are in a healthy range, NOT \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d.\n\nIdeally, taking specific vitamins & herbs to promote healthy cholesterol levels is the easiest and safest solution for most people.\n\n5 \u2013 Exercise & Rest Your Eyes\n\nSo, a few things here.\n\nRemember that you have muscles that control your eyes and they need to be exercised and rested \u2013 just like any muscle.\n\nYour eyes work hard during the day and need a break now and then. The strain can be especially intense if you work at a computer for long stretches at a time, which many of us do \u2013 especially me. To ease the strain, follow the 20-20-20 rule.2\n\nThat means every 20 minutes, you should stop staring at your computer or phone and look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n\nDo this for 3-5 \u201csets\u201d or times. This exercises and relaxes your eyes at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, make sure you wear sunglasses, which is one of the most important steps you can take when it comes to improving your eyesight. You want sunglasses that block out 100 percent of UVA and UVB radiation from sunlight.3\n\nMake sure your glasses say this and thus, don\u2019t buy cheap junk.\n\nSunglasses help protect your eyes from conditions that stem from eye damage. These include cataracts, macular degeneration, and pterygium \u2014 a growth of tissue over the white part of the eye.\n\nAdditionally, sunglasses with proper UV blockage reduce strain and stress on your eye muscles.\n\nSpeaking of which, I also suggest you install blue-blocking software on your computer screens and phones. I\u2019ve spoken about this in a previous article.\n\nThis is important again due to the extra stress your eye deals with modern technology.\n\nIn the old days, the main source of blue light was from the sun. Now it\u2019s everywhere, all day and night. That\u2019s too much stress for both your eyes and your brain.\n\nYou want to make sure you take extra amounts of vitamins and minerals that have been shown to improve eyesight.\n\nIt\u2019s very important to control your blood sugar and blood pressure levels.\n\nYou should have healthy cholesterol levels \u2013 not low or high. And definitely stay AWAY from statin cholesterol-lowering drugs.\n\nMake sure you also exercise and rest your eyes. Use the 20-20-20 rule. Wear sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB lights. And use blue-blockers as well.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to start implementing the 20-20-20 rule and using blue blockers \u2013 both are FREE and can be utilized in minutes.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8658343\n\nhttps://nei.nih.gov/kids/healthy_vision_tips\n\nhttps://nei.nih.gov/hvm/healthy_eyes_glasses",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/7-foods-that-kill-7-types-of-cancers/",
    "content": "It\u2019s now 2025 and almost everyone knows somebody who has had cancer and maybe even died from it.\n\nThe unfortunate part is that there are so many types of cancers to be concerned about.\n\nHowever, today I\u2019m going to reveal the top 7 cancers and the best cancer-fighting foods to eat for that specific cancer.\n\nI\u2019ll then finish by summarizing the best 7 foods that will help fight all these top cancer killers.\n\nSo, you can focus on the cancer you\u2019re concerned about or have a family history for. Or, just eat the top 7 foods that fight them all.\n\nI\u2019m going to start with the least deadly cancer and end with the #1 deadliest cancer.\n\nThis only affects men, usually past the age of 50 and is a major cancer risk in men.\n\nHormones play a big role here. More specifically, low testosterone, but high DHT and Estrogen.\n\nThe positives with prostate cancer are:\n\nEarly Detection and Screening: Prostate cancer is frequently detected early through PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screenings. Early detection generally leads to effective treatment options.\n\nSlow Progression: Many types of prostate cancer grow slowly, so it\u2019s not as aggressive as other cancers.\n\nHigh Survival Rates: Prostate cancer generally has a high 5-year survival rate (around 98% for localized cases) because it\u2019s often confined to the prostate. Treatment options such as surgery, radiation, and hormone therapy are also quite effective in most cases.\n\nAge Factor: While it\u2019s common in older men, prostate cancer often progresses so slowly that men may live with the disease without it becoming life-threatening, particularly when diagnosed at a late age.\n\n\u2026 this is what\u2019s happened with 2 of my uncles. They\u2019ve had prostate cancer for years and they are doing well.\n\nFoods For Prostate Cancer\n\nTomatoes: High in lycopene, an antioxidant linked to a lower risk of prostate cancer; cooking tomatoes in olive oil increases lycopene absorption.\n\nGreen Tea: Contains EGCG, which may inhibit prostate cancer cell growth and prevent tumor blood vessel formation.\n\nPumpkin Seeds: Rich in zinc, which supports prostate health, and phytosterols, which may help reduce prostate enlargement.\n\nPomegranate: Contains antioxidants like ellagic acid, which may slow the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n\nCruciferous Vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower): Contain sulforaphane, which helps inhibit cancer cell growth in the prostate.\n\nThis is the cancer Steve Jobs died from.\n\nYour pancreas secretes the hormone insulin, which helps lower blood sugar.\n\nThe problem with pancreatic cancer is it has a poor prognosis and is often diagnosed in the late stages when it\u2019s harder to fight.\n\nFoods For Pancreatic Cancer\n\nCruciferous Vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts) Contains sulforaphane and other compounds that may reduce inflammation and help neutralize cancer-causing agents. These vegetables support liver detoxification, which is crucial in reducing the load of carcinogens on the pancreas.\n\nLeafy Greens (e.g., spinach, kale, Swiss chard) Rich in chlorophyll, fiber, and antioxidants like beta-carotene, which may protect cells from DNA damage and reduce oxidative stress associated with pancreatic cancer risk.\n\nBerries (e.g., blueberries, raspberries, strawberries) High in antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins, which can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the pancreas. These compounds have been linked to a reduced risk of several cancers, including pancreatic cancer.\n\nTurmeric Contains curcumin, an anti-inflammatory compound that may help slow cancer cell growth. Research suggests curcumin can inhibit cancer-promoting enzymes in the pancreas, reducing the chance of cancer progression.\n\nGarlic It contains sulfur compounds that support detoxification and boost immune response. Garlic may lower inflammation and has been associated with a reduced risk of digestive cancers, including pancreatic cancer.\n\nFatty Fish (e.g., salmon, sardines, mackerel) Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties that may help protect against pancreatic cancer. Omega-3s can reduce inflammatory markers and support cellular health in the pancreas.\n\nTomatoes It contains lycopene, an antioxidant shown to reduce cancer cell proliferation. Lycopene in tomatoes may reduce inflammation in pancreatic tissue and protect cells from free radical damage.\n\nFiber (e.g., whole grains, legumes & vegetables) High in fiber foods such as whole grains, legumes and vegetables help regulate blood sugar levels, reducing strain on the pancreas. Fiber also promotes digestive health and may lower the risk of pancreatic cancer by supporting a balanced microbiome.\n\nAn important part of pancreatic cancer is managing your blood sugar levels.\n\nBreast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women globally.\n\nBy the way, men can also get breast cancer.\n\nBreast cancer can be aggressive, which is the bad part.\n\nOne benefit is that we have more early detection for breast cancer than other forms of cancer, which is great news. There\u2019s more awareness for breast cancer prevention.\n\nRemember, the earlier you catch cancer, the better the odds you\u2019ll fight it and win.\n\nRisk factors: Genetics, hormone exposure, and lifestyle\n\nFoods For Breast Cancer\n\nSoy Foods (tofu, tempeh, edamame): Contain isoflavones, which have a mild estrogen-like effect and may help reduce the risk of hormone-related breast cancers.\n\nFlaxseeds: High in lignans, which can help modulate estrogen levels and have shown protective effects against breast cancer.\n\nBerries (blueberries, blackberries): Contain antioxidants and fiber, which protect cells and may reduce the spread of cancer cells.\n\nCruciferous Vegetables (broccoli, Brussels sprouts): Packed with compounds like indole-3-carbinol, which supports healthy estrogen metabolism.\n\nFatty Fish (salmon, sardines): Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory effects and may reduce breast cancer risk.\n\nStomach (Gastric) Cancer\n\nI was surprised about stomach cancer being so high, globally. However, based on the foods we eat these days, I can understand why.\n\nOne problem with stomach cancer is that the symptoms for it, such as indigestion or stomach discomfort are often mild or mistaken for other digestive issues. So, there\u2019s a delay in diagnosis.\n\nRisk factors include H. pylori infection, smoking, and certain diets that are high in processed and smoked foods.\n\nSo, think twice about all of the blackened BBQ meats.\n\nFoods For Stomach Cancer\n\nGinger: Known for its anti-inflammatory effects, ginger may help reduce stomach inflammation and protect against gastric cancer.\n\nGarlic: Contains sulfur compounds that help reduce the risk of stomach cancer by inhibiting the growth of H. pylori, a bacteria linked to stomach cancer.\n\nGreen Leafy Vegetables (e.g., spinach, Swiss chard): Rich in fiber, antioxidants, and folate, which are protective against stomach cancer.\n\nBerries: High in antioxidants that help combat free radicals and reduce cell damage in the stomach.\n\nTurmeric: Curcumin, the active compound, is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may inhibit cancer cell growth in the stomach.\n\nLiver cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death.\n\nYour liver, along with your kidney, detoxifies and cleanses almost everything that you put in your body.\n\nThe more junk you put in \u2013 such as processed fatty foods, drugs, alcohol, etc. the more stress on the liver.\n\nLiver cancer can be very deadly because it\u2019s often diagnosed at advanced stages due to limited early symptoms.\n\nRisk factors include hepatitis infections, oral medications, alcohol, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\nFoods For Liver Cancer\n\nCoffee: Studies suggest coffee may reduce the risk of liver cancer by reducing inflammation and supporting liver health.\n\nGreen Tea: The antioxidants in green tea help reduce liver inflammation and protect against cellular damage.\n\nBeets: Rich in betalains and antioxidants that support liver detoxification and reduce oxidative stress.\n\nCruciferous Vegetables (Brussels sprouts, cabbage): Contain compounds that support liver detoxification and protect against cancer cells.\n\nBerries (blueberries, strawberries): High in antioxidants, which reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, supporting liver health.\n\nColorectal cancer is the same as colon cancer, or rectal cancer, depending on where it originates in the digestive system\n\nIt\u2019s the second leading cause of cancer deaths.\n\nIt\u2019s deadly because it\u2019s slow-growing and has no real symptoms in the early stages.\n\nDiet, genetics and stress are risk factors.\n\nHowever, the great news is that colon cancer can almost be completely preventable if you do colonoscopies often. Start early at the age of 40 or 45. Do them every 2-5 years, especially if you have a family history.\n\nIf caught early, it\u2019s totally fixable.\n\nMost people start late with colonoscopies or delay them due to the potential discomfort and don\u2019t do them regularly enough. Every 10 years is not ideal, even if the medical industry says that\u2019s the norm.\n\nDemand them more often, even if you pay out of pocket.\n\nFoods For Colorectal Cancer\n\nWhole Grains (oats, brown rice, barley): High in fiber, which supports digestive health and may lower the risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nGarlic and Onions: Contain sulfur compounds that help eliminate carcinogens and reduce tumor formation.\n\nLeafy Greens (spinach, kale): Packed with fiber, folate, and carotenoids, which have protective effects against colorectal cancer.\n\nProbiotic-Rich Foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut): Support a healthy gut microbiome, which is essential for immune function and can reduce inflammation.\n\nLegumes (beans, lentils): High in fiber and antioxidants, they promote healthy digestion and may lower the risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nTo my surprise, lung cancer is the leading cause of death globally. But, I guess I\u2019m surprised because I never smoked anything.\n\nOne major problem with lung cancer is often detected in later stages, making treatment less effective\n\nThe primary risk factors are, of course, smoking\u2026 but also air pollution.\n\nFoods For Lung Cancer\n\nTurmeric: Contains curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may help inhibit lung cancer cell growth.\n\nCruciferous Vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage): Rich in sulforaphane, which can help protect cells from DNA damage and reduce the spread of cancer cells.\n\nGreen Tea: Contains EGCG, an antioxidant that may help block the growth of cancer cells and prevent tumor blood supply.\n\nGinger: Known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, ginger may help reduce inflammation that contributes to lung cancer risk.\n\nOranges and Other Citrus Fruits: High in vitamin C and other antioxidants that protect cells from free radical damage linked to lung cancer.\n\n7 Best Cancer-Fighting Foods \u2013 Summarized\n\nNow, let\u2019s finish with a summary of the 7 best foods cancer-fighting foods.\n\nCruciferous Vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage)\n\nCancers: Lung, Colorectal, Liver, Breast, Prostate Why: Rich in sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol, compounds that support detoxification, protect DNA, and reduce cancer cell growth.\n\nCancers: Lung, Liver, Stomach, Breast, Prostate Why: Contains EGCG, an antioxidant that cuts off blood supply to tumors (anti-angiogenesis) and has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth and reduce inflammation.\n\nBerries (e.g., blueberries, strawberries, blackberries)\n\nCancers: Lung, Stomach, Liver, Breast Why: High in antioxidants like vitamin C and ellagic acid, which protect cells from oxidative stress and inhibit cancer cell spread.\n\nCancers: Colorectal, Stomach, Lung Why: These alliums contain sulfur compounds that aid in detoxification, enhance immune function, and may reduce the risk of various cancers by inhibiting carcinogens.\n\nCancers: Lung, Stomach, Liver Why: Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that help slow cancer cell growth and induce cancer cell death (apoptosis).\n\nCancers: Stomach, Prostate, Lung Why: Rich in lycopene, which has been shown to reduce the risk of prostate and other cancers by protecting cells from damage and inhibiting tumor growth.\n\nLeafy Green Vegetables (e.g., spinach, kale, Swiss chard)\n\nCancers: Colorectal, Stomach, Liver Why: High in fiber, folate, and antioxidants that support cellular health, immune function, and detoxification, reducing cancer risk.\n\nThese foods make a great foundation for a cancer-preventive diet, as their broad-spectrum benefits help reduce inflammation, combat oxidative stress, lower blood sugar and support the body\u2019s natural defenses against cancer.\n\nIncluding these foods regularly is a proactive way to guard against multiple types of cancer.\n\nPlease share this important information with others so they can live a longer and healthier life.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/non-calorie-sweeteners-6-best-most-popular/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019ll quickly cover the 6 best non-calorie sweeteners, including one that potentially acts like Ozempic, a GLP-1 agonist.\n\nAnd I mention this because most people consume way too much sugar. Most of it is from pre-packed foods. It\u2019s hidden in everything. All you have to do is read the label.\n\nAnd even then, the labels can be misleading.\n\nUnfortunately, most of us are in some way, addicted to sugar. The brain loves it.\n\nIn mice studies, the mice actually preferred sugar over cocaine, that\u2019s how powerful and addictive sugar is.\n\nAnd this is one big reason why most people these days are overweight, have more:\n\nmore anxiety and depression,\n\nhigher cholesterol, blood pressure, and of course, high blood sugar levels.\n\nSo if you do consume sugar, I\u2019d rather you replace it with one of today\u2019s 6 non-calorie sweeteners.\n\nI\u2019ll give you the pros and cons of each and then finish with my own personal recommendations.\n\nCombined with a healthy diet, exercise and add in specific herbs you\u2019re guaranteed healthy blood sugar levels at any age, even if you\u2019re a type 2 diabetic.\n\nSource: Extracted from the leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana plant.\n\nMain Compounds: Stevioside and rebaudioside A.\n\nZero glycemic index; does not affect blood sugar levels.\n\nMay have health benefits, including potential blood pressure and blood sugar regulation.\n\nHeat-stable, making it suitable for cooking and baking.\n\nSlightly bitter or licorice-like aftertaste for some people.\n\nKeep in mind that there are highly processed versions (e.g., Truvia), which include additives or other sweeteners. So, try to source organic, non-branded ones.\n\nMay cause bloating or digestive issues in some people.\n\nThis is the one I typically use since it\u2019s in powder form and easy to use.\n\nSource: Sugar alcohol found in some fruits; typically produced from corn via fermentation.\n\nCalories: Nearly zero, as it is not fully metabolized by the body.\n\nDoes not spike blood sugar or insulin levels.\n\nVery low risk of digestive upset compared to other sugar alcohols.\n\nHeat-stable and suitable for cooking and baking.\n\nMay have antioxidant properties.\n\nIt can cause digestive discomfort (gas, bloating) in large amounts.\n\nProduced from corn, so most likely it is GMO \u2013 genetically modified.\n\nOften paired with other sweeteners, so check labels carefully.\n\nThis is found in protein bars many times. It will also be listed as Sugar Alcohol.\n\nPersonally, if I consume a little bit too much, I get gassy\u2026 this is a problem with many of the sugar alcohols if you consume too much.\n\n3. Monk Fruit Sweetener\n\nSource: Extracted from the Siraitia grosvenorii fruit.\n\nMain Compound: Mogrosides.\n\nZero calories and no impact on blood sugar.\n\nNo known digestive issues or safety concerns.\n\nHeat-stable and suitable for cooking and baking.\n\nMore expensive than other sweeteners.\n\nPure monk fruit extract can be hard to find, often blended with erythritol or other fillers.\n\nSlight fruity aftertaste, which may not appeal to everyone.\n\nI don\u2019t have much experience with this because of the cost, hard to find, and because it is mixed with other ingredients, such as sugar alcohols.\n\nSource: A rare sugar naturally found in small quantities in fruits like figs and raisins.\n\nCalories: About 0.4 kcal/gram (technically not non-caloric but extremely low-calorie).\n\nMimics the taste and texture of sugar closely.\n\nLow glycemic index and does not spike blood sugar.\n\nMay have potential benefits for fat loss and blood sugar control.\n\nMay cause mild digestive upset in large amounts (bloating, diarrhea).\n\nExpensive compared to more common sweeteners.\n\nNot yet approved for use in all countries (e.g., EU).\n\nThis is gaining popularity recently and might be one of the best ones.\n\nThese 4 are the best natural, non-calorie sweeteners.\n\nLet me quickly go over the 2 most popular artificial sweeteners.\n\n5. Sucralose (Splenda)\n\nSource: Artificial sweetener derived from sugar through chemical modification.\n\nCalories: Zero, as it is not metabolized by the body.\n\nExtremely sweet, so only small amounts are needed.\n\nHeat-stable for cooking and baking.\n\nDoes not affect blood sugar levels.\n\nArtificial origin may deter some people.\n\nControversial due to potential effects on gut microbiota with excessive use.\n\nMay degrade at high temperatures, forming potentially harmful compounds.\n\nSucralose tastes very close to real sugar. It\u2019s found in many health products \u2013 such as protein drinks, bars and so forth.\n\n6. Aspartame (NutraSweet)\n\nSource: Artificial sweetener made from two amino acids, aspartic acid, and phenylalanine.\n\nCalories: Very low, as it is about 200 times sweeter than sugar.\n\nApproved by major health organizations as safe within acceptable daily limits.\n\nWidely available and cost-effective.\n\nClosely mimics sugar in taste.\n\nNot heat-stable, limiting its use in cooking and baking.\n\nControversial due to alleged health risks, though research largely supports its safety.\n\nUnsuitable for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), who can\u2019t metabolize phenylalanine.\n\nThis is found in most sodas. There are people who have said that aspartame is bad for you. However, it\u2019s the most studied and there are thousands of studies stating how safe it is.\n\nThe reported negative effects happen at an extremely high dose in animal studies. The equivalent of having like 50+ cans of soda daily for years.\n\nHowever, I do know that it can cause excitation in the brain in some people, causing them anxiety.\n\nSome studies show a change in gut flora, but they don\u2019t say anything positive or negative.\n\nAgain, in the most human, randomized double-blind clinical studies, it has shown to be very safe and has been use for decades.\n\nSource: Oldest artificial sweetener, discovered in the 1870s.\n\nLong safety record with extensive research.\n\nExtremely sweet and effective in small amounts.\n\nWidely available and inexpensive.\n\nMay have a metallic or bitter aftertaste.\n\nHistorical controversy over cancer risk in rodents, though this risk does not appear relevant to humans.\n\n8. Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K)\n\nSource: Artificial sweetener often used in combination with others.\n\nHeat-stable, making it suitable for cooking and baking.\n\nOften used in combination with other sweeteners to mask aftertaste.\n\nSlightly bitter aftertaste when used alone.\n\nLimited long-term human studies.\n\nPersonally speaking, I do fine with all of them. Granted, I also don\u2019t consume much sugar or non-calorie sweeteners, natural or artificial.\n\nI drink mainly water. So, I\u2019m boring.\n\nIf you\u2019re a soda drinker and chose diet soda, which is much better than sugar soda \u2013 then you don\u2019t have much choice. Most of them contain aspartame.\n\nI don\u2019t like the sugar alcohol ones too much, because of the potential gas and diarrhea. So for me, that means no Erythritol or Monk Fruit.\n\nI primarily use organic Stevia powder.\n\nThis now leads us to Allulose, which might be one of the best ones.\n\nEven though it\u2019s structurally similar to fruit sugar, fructose \u2013 there\u2019s just one small difference in the molecular structure, so your body won\u2019t metabolize it like fruit sugar, even though it tastes like sugar.\n\nNow, the one difference between Allulose and other sweeteners is that in studies, it helps secret GLP1, which is how drugs like Ozempic work.\n\nThus, it could potentially reduce your appetite and lead to faster weight loss.\n\nGranted, I don\u2019t know how that translates to the real world. Basically, don\u2019t think that by consuming allulose, you\u2019re getting Ozempic-like effects.\n\nFor the natural sweeteners \u2013 Stevia and allulose are my favorites. Stevia is cheaper and easier to use and find. Allulose does taste more like sugar than stevia\n\nFor artificial sweeteners, sucralose is versatile and heat-stable and tastes better than aspartame.\n\nChoose a sweetener that aligns with your dietary needs, taste preferences, and tolerance. Moderation is key, as overuse of any sweetener can lead to dependency on overly sweet flavors.\n\nAnd make sure to read important information about how to best improve your blood sugar naturally, so you can live longer, have more muscle, less body fat and better brain function.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019ll reveal 6 groups of people who should not eat dates.\n\nI\u2019ll list the specific health problems related to eating dates and possible solutions & action steps for those of you who just love eating dates and want to continue enjoying them.\n\nPersonally, I love dates. I grew up eating dates all the time because of my dad.\n\nHe\u2019d start every morning eating 2 dates. Later in the afternoon, he\u2019d have more with his tea.\n\nHe said that they are full of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. And he was right\u2026\n\nI was a kid, so I honestly didn\u2019t care if they were good for me, I just liked how they tasted since they were sweet and chewy.\n\nMy parents didn\u2019t allow me to have much candy, so dates were my second option.\n\nThese days dates are promoted as a superfood. They are found in healthy cereals, protein bars, drinks, smoothies, and other healthy foods.\n\nUnfortunately, this popular health food should not be eaten by certain people and should be avoided.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started with the 6 groups of people who should avoid or limit dates.\n\nAt the end, I\u2019ll also give you options on how you can still enjoy them safely.\n\n1. If You Have Diabetes or Blood Sugar Issues\n\nDates are high in natural sugars. They contain glucose, sucrose, and, primarily, fructose, which is fruit sugar.\n\nFor people with diabetes, they can cause rapid blood sugar spikes, making it harder to manage blood sugar levels. Just two dates contain the same amount of sugar as four Oreo cookies!\n\nGranted, dates have a lower glycemic index than most carbohydrates because of the fiber and fructose.\n\nHowever, dates tend to increase blood sugar a lot in those people who are sensitive, overweight and over the age of 40.\n\nAction Step: If you have diabetes, or high blood sugar levels or A1C \u2013 limit your intake to one date or avoid them altogether if they cause blood sugar spikes.\n\nHowever, if you still want to eat them or similar foods, make sure you take supplements that help lower blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity.\n\nI take Blood Sugar Optimizer with my meals.\n\n2. If You Have Digestive Problems\n\nDates are a high FODMAP food, which can cause bloating, gas, or diarrhea in people with digestive issues, like IBS.\n\nFODMAP foods are carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed by your small intestine. As we get older, these stomach problems get worse.\n\nTypical FODMAP foods are fruits, vegetables, grains and dairy products. However, dates are on the higher end and thus, more problematic.\n\nAction Step: If you experience digestive discomfort, reduce the number of dates you eat or avoid them. You can try soaking dates in water overnight to make them easier to digest.\n\n3. If You Have Dental Issues\n\nThe high sugar content and sticky texture of dates can stick to your teeth and lead to cavities.\n\nSome people just have great tooth genetics, I\u2019m not one of those people. So, I stay away from any sticky and sugary foods because of my teeth problems.\n\nAction Step: After eating dates, brush and floss your teeth or rinse your mouth with water to prevent tooth decay.\n\n4. If You Have Sulfite Sensitivity\n\nSome dates are preserved with sulfites, which can cause breathing issues, especially for those with asthma.\n\nAlso, if you have allergies for whatever reason, the sulfites can make things much worse.\n\nAction Step: Look for sulfite-free dates if you have asthma, allergies, or suspect sulfite sensitivity.\n\n5. If You Have Allergies\n\nAlthough rare, some people can be allergic to dates, which can cause itching, swelling, or even serious reactions.\n\nAction Step: If you think you might be allergic, stop eating dates and consult an allergist.\n\n6. If You\u2019re Taking Certain Medications\n\nDates can interfere with medications for blood sugar or blood pressure.\n\nAction Step: If you take drugs for lowering blood sugar. Or, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or similar drugs to lower blood pressure \u2013 you should reduce or avoid dates.\n\nSo those are the groups of people who should be concerned about eating dates.\n\nBut, let\u2019s say you still want to eat them. No problem, let me give some options and best practices:\n\nSoaking dates removes tannins and other compounds that make them harder to digest, making them softer and easier to absorb nutrients from.\n\nSo, soak dates before eating them.\n\nIdeally, it would be overnight for 8-10 hours.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re in a rush, soak them for 20 minutes in warm water.\n\nDigestion is one problem with dates. However, the biggest problem is the sugar.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, taking an \u201call-in-one\u201d supplement such as Blood Sugar Optimizer can help promote healthy blood sugar response, reduce spikes, and improve insulin sensitivity and A1C levels within a normal, healthy range.\n\nStep 2 is the timing of when you eat dates.\n\nLike any carbohydrates, it\u2019s best to eat them with proteins, fibers and healthy fat to lower the blood sugar spike and glycemic load of the meal.\n\nStep 3 is portion control and limiting how much you eat them.\n\nFor a healthy adult, I would say the maximum is 2 dates per day.\n\nIf you have blood sugar or pressure problems or are overweight, I\u2019d limit it to 1 a day.\n\nRemember, just because a food is labeled as healthy, it does NOT mean it\u2019s healthy for everyone or specifically for YOUR body at YOUR age and current health concerns.",

    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m going to talk about oats and oatmeal. You\u2019ll discover:\n\nSome important health benefits\n\nWhat\u2019s the best form of oats\n\nWhy you should NOT eat them for breakfast and the best time to eat them\n\nThe surprising negatives\n\nHealth warnings of toxicity\n\nAnd I bring up this topic because a subscriber asked the following:\n\n\u201cHello Dr. Sam \u2013 I wanted to know if you eat oatmeal. I eat a big bowl every morning and I wanted to know if this is good or bad? I heard it\u2019s full of vitamins, fiber, and good for lowering my cholesterol, blood sugar, and weight loss. It\u2019s also good for energy. Thus, like a perfect food. Do you agree? Thanks boss!\u201d\n\nimprovements in cholesterol\n\n\u2026 are the primary reasons people eat oatmeal \u2013 other than the obvious reason that they like how it tastes.\n\nBenefits Of Oats and Oatmeal\n\nTo begin with, oats are grains and have lots of vitamins and minerals, so they are very nutritious. Especially when compared to other grains.\n\nThey also contain a good amount of soluble fiber and beta-glucan, which helps with cholesterol levels.\n\nNow, it doesn\u2019t lower blood sugar, but it has a decent glycemic load and thus, doesn\u2019t raise blood sugar levels that much. Certainly not like your typical breakfast cereals.\n\n\u201cSteel cut\u201d oats are the healthiest because they are minimally processed, which means higher fiber and the lowest effects on blood sugar.\n\nBest Time To Eat Oatmeal\n\nMost people eat oats in the morning, but I think this is the worst time.\n\nOne main reason is that oatmeal is high in the amino acid tryptophan, which helps produce serotonin\u2026 a chemical that can cause a calming and relaxing effect.\n\nIn fact, you take tryptophan at night to put you to sleep.\n\nSpeaking of sleep, oats also contain melatonin, the sleep hormone.\n\nOne cup of oats contains up to 150 mg of Typrophan. That\u2019s higher than most carbohydrates.\n\nWhile Tryptophan, which is an amino acid, is typically found in higher amounts in proteins. For example\n\nTurkey: Around 181 mg per 3 oz serving\n\nChicken: Around 165 mg per 3 oz serving\n\nAdditionally, most people eat oats with other carbohydrates and sugars, which when combined with higher tryptophan levels, can cause you to for sure slowdown, and relax.\n\nTryptophan & melatonin are great for better sleep, but that\u2019s NOT what you want in the morning.\n\nInstead, a better time would be later in the evening to help you relax and get better sleep.\n\nHowever, if you still want to have oats in the morning, make sure to eat them with a good protein source and limit the extra sugars with that meal \u2013 such as fruit juice, sugar, and syrups.\n\nAnd this is also why prepackaged oats aren\u2019t good since they do contain more junk in them.\n\nNegatives Of Oats / Oatmeal\n\nOats can contain gluten and lectins, which can cause inflammation in some people who are sensitive to these compounds.\n\nAdditionally, studies have shown that oats also contain glyphosate, which is a herbicide. They use this to kill plants, such as weeds.\n\nUnfortunately, glyphosate is toxic to humans as well. In fact, it\u2019s a carcinogen, which means it can cause cancer.\n\nThe studies showed that oats contained on average, 360 ppb (parts per billion). That\u2019s twice the \u201callowed\u201d benchmark of health, which is 160 ppb.\n\nSadly, some of the popular samples contained up to 1000 ppb, and some had as high as 2800 ppb.\n\nSo for this reason alone, I suggest you limit your intake of oats\n\nAnd if you do have them, please make sure they are at least organic.\n\nOats are healthier than most of the other grains.\n\nThe healthiest form or type are organic, steel-cut oats\u2026 which are better for blood sugar, and have minimal gluten and toxins.\n\nBecause of the higher tryptophan content which can cause some people to get tired, sleepy or lethargic, I suggest you consume them later in the evening for better sleep. Or, make sure you have it with a complete protein, not just by itself.\n\nI also suggest you stay away from prepackaged oats because they contain all of these negatives\u2026 such as gluten, preservatives, sugars, and so forth.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/cholesterol/why-eating-cholesterol-does-not-increase-your-cholesterol/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m quickly going to reveal why your cholesterol levels being high, has very little to do with the cholesterol foods you eat or have been told not to eat.\n\nI\u2019ll also reveal proven ways to have healthy cholesterol levels, with no change in diet or exercise\u2026 which is exactly what my parents have been doing for years.\n\nSpeaking of my parents, back in 1999, over 25+ years ago, my parents did a blood test for life insurance and both of them had high cholesterol.\n\nSo, each of their doctors independently gave my parents the same diagnosis and solution:\n\nReduce and stop eating foods that contain cholesterol, such as animal proteins, whole eggs, fried foods, butter, and so forth.\n\nTake a cholesterol-lowering statin drug.\n\nThey both followed the doctor\u2019s prescription, especially taking the drug, since it was easy.\n\nThe end result is their cholesterol levels did drop, but they had lots of side effects, such as:\n\n\u2026 basically, just feeling older.\n\nTo make a long story short, I got them off the drugs, I put them on natural supplements and they\u2019ve had healthy cholesterol levels since.\n\nOf course these days, we all know about the negative side effects of these cholesterol-lowering statin drugs.\n\nHowever, most people still think that eating dietary cholesterol found in foods is bad for you and can increase your blood cholesterol and cause heart problems.\n\nUnfortunately, this WRONG information and myth are from 50 years ago.\n\nThe newest research clearly shows the exact opposite.\n\nHow Does Dietary Cholesterol Affect Blood Cholesterol?\n\nThe amount of cholesterol in your diet and the amount of cholesterol in your blood are very different things.\n\nAlthough it may seem logical that eating cholesterol would raise blood cholesterol levels, it usually doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nThe body tightly regulates the amount of cholesterol in the blood by controlling its production of cholesterol from within.\n\nThis is because almost every cell in your body needs cholesterol. It\u2019s vital for your survival.\n\nSo, when your dietary intake of cholesterol goes down from the foods you eat or don\u2019t eat, your body actually makes MORE cholesterol on its own\u2026 because it needs the cholesterol to survive.\n\nCholesterol Containing Foods\n\nWhen you eat greater amounts of cholesterol from your diet, your body makes less cholesterol because it\u2019s already getting it from the foods you eat.\n\nBecause of this, foods high in dietary cholesterol have very little impact on blood cholesterol levels in most people.\n\nYes, some people due to their genetics, are hyper-sensitive to cholesterol found in foods, so they need to pay attention.\n\nInterestingly, even though dietary cholesterol slightly increases LDL in these genetically sensitive individuals, it does not seem to increase their risk of heart disease.\n\nIn fact, lowering your cholesterol levels too low, especially with drugs, can definitely make life a lot harder to live and far less enjoyable. And NO, based on the newest research, you may not live any longer.\n\nBefore I continue, let\u2019s quickly recap what we\u2019ve learned so far:\n\nCholesterol is vital for your survival, especially as it relates to hormone production.\n\nEating more dietary cholesterol does NOT increase blood cholesterol for most people.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should go out and eat a dozen eggs, tons of processed meats, and so forth.\n\nDietary Cholesterol & Heart Disease\n\nContrary to popular belief, heart problems \u2026 such as having a heart attack or stroke \u2013 are NOT only caused by cholesterol. Far from it.\n\nMany factors are involved, the biggest being inflammation. Other important factors would be high blood pressure, high blood sugar and thus, diabetes, and of course, smoking.\n\nReal Cause Of High Cholesterol\n\nKeep in mind the simple fact that aging and the negative changes in your hormones is a massive issue and causing factors of health problems.\n\nThe bottom line is that many high-quality studies have shown that dietary cholesterol is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.\n\nWhole Eggs & High Cholesterol\n\nAnd I mentioned whole eggs earlier since it\u2019s high in cholesterol and everyone is warned to NOT eat them.\n\nHowever, a lot of research has been conducted on eggs specifically. And all of the studies have shown that eating them is not associated with an elevated risk of heart disease\n\nWhat\u2019s more, eggs may even help improve your lipoprotein profiles, which could lower your risk.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve posted all the clinical studies below this article, for your convenience and reference.\n\nSo, there you have it.\n\nEating pasture-raised whole eggs, and grass-fed meats is NOT going to raise your cholesterol for most people.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re one of the rare genetically sensitive people to saturated fats and cholesterol, my suggestion is to reduce, but not eliminate these nutritious foods.\n\nHowever, I would recommend you reduce or eliminate processed foods and meats\u2026 Simple carbs and sugars.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of drugs because I think they are overkill and have too many long-term side effects.\n\nI think diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle are important of course, but for most people, it\u2019s just too hard to follow.\n\nThis is why my parents have been taking Cholesterol Optimizer since 1999 to help promote healthy cholesterol levels within a normal range. Not high or low.\n\nIt\u2019s fast-acting, easy and convenient to use, and has a proven track record \u2013 so you know it\u2019s healthy to use.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22037012\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8857917\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26109578\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7585286\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19751443\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26109578\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26864369\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16340654\n\nhttp://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8539\n\nhttp://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/189529\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23676423",

    "content": "Who should avoid eating eggs\n\nDifference between the yolk and white\n\nHow many eggs to consume daily\n\nWhat type of eggs are best\n\nHow to cook the eggs.\n\nEggs are one of the rare perfect foods because each the yolk and the white have the perfect blend of amino acids, so it\u2019s a complete protein with one of the highest biological values \u2013 thus, it gets utilized much better than other proteins and certain way better than vegetable proteins.\n\nPersonally, I really like eggs.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my dad would make me omelets on the weekends. He would use butter, a few whole eggs, and a bunch of vegetables like mushrooms and peppers, and sometimes, he\u2019d even cut up hotdogs into little slices and throw them into the pan.\n\nI still remember how good the kitchen smelled and how great the food tasted.\n\nThen I started bodybuilding and well, things changed. No more egg yolks.\n\nAll the big guys were eating only egg whites.\n\nWhich by the way, can taste disgusting after a while.\n\nLater I find out how eating only egg whites isn\u2019t good for your health. Even though all the calories and fat are in the yolks, so are all the nutrients and half the amino acids.\n\nPlus, having only the whites can cause a biotin deficiency and cause stomach problems.\n\nSo, no more egg whites.\n\nOf course, then I find out how eating whole eggs is bad for you as well because it can raise cholesterol levels and thus, may cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\nIt was all so confusing that I just stopped eating eggs altogether for a few years.\n\nSo I added eggs to the long list of foods that are going to kill you, right\u2026 It\u2019s like, you can\u2019t eat anything these days.\n\nEggs Raise Your Cholesterol?\n\nBut, over time, research revealed that whole eggs actually do NOT cause cholesterol issues for the majority of people.\n\nThe cholesterol from the foods you eat does NOT raise blood cholesterol. In fact, the majority of the cholesterol is formed within your body by the liver, NOT from the foods we eat.\n\nThis is because every cell in your body needs cholesterol and thus, it will make it on its own to live.\n\nCholesterol also makes your hormones, which are vital for health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nThe yolk does contain some saturated fats, which can be problematic in high amounts.\n\nBut more of the fat is actually from unsaturated fats including both mono and poly \u2013 both of which can reduce your risk of heart disease.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re worried about the cholesterol and saturated fats found in the yolk, for 95% of people it won\u2019t make a difference in your blood tests.\n\nThere are other reasons for high cholesterol in your blood tests, it\u2019s not the eggs. Here is the link to my parent\u2019s cholesterol-fix formula if you\u2019re interested in having healthy cholesterol levels, naturally.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m not telling you to go fry a bunch of eggs daily, dump some cheese on them, add in some bacon, and eat it all with croissants or muffins or a bunch of bread and wash it down with a big glass of orange juice.\n\nAs tasty as that sounds, that\u2019s not going to be healthy at all and it\u2019s a lot of calories.\n\nNow, one problem though with eggs is that they are one of the most common food allergens, especially in children.\n\nAs I said earlier, the whites are problematic too. I had a big bodybuilder friend of mine have a dozen egg whites daily. Which is only about 35 grams of protein. But when I told him to stop, all of his stomach problems disappeared.\n\nLike I said earlier, the egg is a perfect protein food. There are a lot of nutrients in eggs, especially the yolk.\n\nWhole eggs, primarily because of the yolks, are high in vitamins such as B12, B2, A, and E. It also has choline, lutein, zeaxanthin, selenium, and phosphorus. All of which are good for your body, muscles, eyes, and especially the brain.\n\nThe cholesterol in the eggs also tends to boost testosterone levels a little bit, which is good for muscles and sex drive.\n\nBest Way To Have Your Eggs\n\nI think 2 a day is good for most people. Some can take more and some less.\n\nThere\u2019s a myth that brown eggs are healthier than white. There\u2019s, no difference.\n\nIdeally, you want the yolk to be a dark, rich yellow \u2013 not pale. But, these days the type of food and additives they give the chicken can artificially change the color of the yolk, so that\u2019s not always the best indicator.\n\nIdeally, you want organic, pasture-raised eggs. They do cost more, but they are healthier.\n\nHaving the yolk a little runny, helps preserve more of the nutrients and is better for you. Make sure the white is cooked though. So, a sunny side up or a soft-boiled egg would be ideal.\n\nIt\u2019s best to not fry up your eggs with oil and butter \u2013 if for no other reason, it\u2019s just more added calories.\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nThe whole egg is a perfect protein and a good source of vitamins. If you want to have lots of egg whites, at least throw in 2 whole eggs to improve the nutritional value.\n\nFor 95% of people, eating whole eggs isn\u2019t going to cause cholesterol problems. There are other reasons for high cholesterol and that has to do with aging, negative changes in your hormones, and other processed foods you eat.\n\nThere\u2019s no difference between brown or white eggs. It\u2019s best to get organic, pasture-raised eggs.\n\nI think 2 eggs daily is good for most people. Preferably cooked sunny-side up or soft-boiled so the yolk is a little runny.\n\nBe mindful of allergens since eggs, especially white, are a high-allergen food. If you start noticing skin problems, for example, get off eggs for a couple of months and see how you feel.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is super important and so, I\u2019m going to get right to it.\n\nThere have been various studies showing how addictive sugar is. Some even suggest that sugar is 7x more addictive than cocaine and even heroin.\n\nIn fact, if sugar is combined with another food type or macronutrient, it\u2019s even MORE addictive\u2026 and I\u2019ll talk about this in another article.\n\nNow, these studies were done on rats, not humans.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think anyone can deny that sugar is very tasty and can have an addictive quality to it.\n\nNow personally, I\u2019m not into sugary foods. I never crave sugar. I\u2019m more of a salty food kind of person.\n\nHowever, if I do have something with sugar, even though I don\u2019t naturally crave it, I do notice myself still continuing to eat it, even when I\u2019m full.\n\nAnd if I start to have sugar often, I start to think about it more.\n\nSomething that would never happen if I was eating a vegetable for example or even some protein like beef or chicken.\n\nEven fruit has its limits and contains lots of natural sugars.\n\nScientific Research on Sugar\n\nNow, the rat study basically showed that 94% of the rats, preferred sugar over cocaine.\n\nWhat is super interesting is the study also showed the rats preferred sugar OR saccharin, an artificial sweetener \u2013 over cocaine.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not just about the actual sugar calories or molecules attaching to different receptors in the body and the brain, but the actual taste of something sweet, even when it\u2019s fake and artificial.\n\nThus, something sweet is even more addictive than the actual sugar molecule.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I tell people to stay away from artificial sweeteners.\n\nAnd if you didn\u2019t know, as sugar levels go up, so does your insulin hormone and this leads to so many health problems \u2014 heart problems, blood pressure problems, memory loss, weight gain, muscle loss, impotence, fatigue, accelerated aging of your cells, and on and on.\n\nControlling your blood sugar is a major key to living a healthier and longer life and it\u2019s super hard to do this if you keep eating addictive sugar every day.\n\nWhy Does Sugar Taste So Good?\n\nNow, why is sugar so addictive?\u2026 because when you eat sugar and something sweet, both opioids and dopamine are released.\n\nOpioids are like heroin and have morphine-like effects and thus, help reduce pain. Physical OR emotional.\n\nAnd dopamine is a neurotransmitter and basically, a pleasure chemical \u2013 which is how cocaine works.\n\nSo sugar interacts with BOTH of these chemicals and receptors, both PAIN and PLEASURE and this is one reason it\u2019s so addictive.\n\nIt works on both of these powerful forces at the same time!\n\nThey work on the reward centers in your body, which can lead to compulsive behavior, despite the negative consequences \u2013 which is what an addiction is.\n\nIn this case with sugar, it would be all the health problems that I just mentioned, such as weight gain.\n\nYou know it\u2019s bad for you, but you keep doing it and can\u2019t stop \u2014 THIS is the problem with sugar.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to control an addiction with just willpower.\n\nHow Do I Stop Taking Sugar?\n\nSo the point of today\u2019s topic is that it may NOT be your fault you keep eating sugary foods, they\u2019re addictive and the food industry knows this.\n\nHowever, now that you know this, it IS your responsibility to take action.\n\nYou need to pay attention to the foods you eat and read the labels and do your best to slowly reduce the added sugars in your diet.\n\nJust like a drug, I do NOT suggest you stop cold turkey. It\u2019s just insane and very hard to do with food, especially sugar since it\u2019s in almost everything these days.\n\nOf course, there are lots of hidden sugars in the foods when you eat out. That we can\u2019t control as much. But here\u2019s what you CAN control\u2026\n\nSoft drinks and juices are loaded with sugars. So are many of the coffee and energy drinks people consume.\n\nRead labels and look for words such as\n\nSugar, brown sugar, cane sugar, or anything similar is all just sugar.\n\nGlucose or sucrose, dextrose, maltose, or anything with an ending of an \u201c-ose\u201d is sugar.\n\nAny \u201csyrup\u201d is a sugar.\n\nThe less sugar you consume, the less your body will crave, and slowly over time you won\u2019t need or desire it as much.\n\nIn addition to lowering your sugar intake, you need to start improving your blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.\n\nBy doing this, your body will also crave less sugar and decrease or destroy that sugar addiction much faster, while also making you healthier.\n\nAnd for more information about supporting healthy blood sugar, visit the special link and article I have for you.\n\nAgain, please pay attention to the foods you eat, read the labels, and visit the links to support healthy blood sugar and decrease your sugar cravings.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/14/910\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23719144\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1931610/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/\n\nhttp://www.foodaddictionsummit.org/docs/Hoebel-sugaraddiction.pdf",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/when-drinking-water-is-bad-for-your-health/",
    "content": "I believe water is one of the most important \u201cnutrients\u201d for your health. In fact, there are 3 main things you need to live and survive:\n\nOxygen \u2013 without it, you\u2019d die in a couple of minutes.\n\nWater \u2013 without it, you\u2019d die in about 3 days or so.\n\nFood \u2013 without it, you\u2019d die in about a week.\n\nUnfortunately, most people\n\ndon\u2019t drink enough water (and too much of the wrong liquids).\n\nIF they do, they drink the wrong kind of water.\n\ndrink during the wrong times.\n\nToday I\u2019m going to discuss #3, drinking water during the wrong times, which can actually be BAD for your health.\n\nSo I\u2019ll get right to it and keep it simple for you today. You should NOT drink water around mealtime or when you eat food. This means not before, during, or after.\n\nAnd this actually pertains to ALL liquids \u2013 soda, tea, juice, coffee, alcohol, etc. In fact, these other liquids are even worse!\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t drink water immediately BEFORE your meal because it dilutes and washes away your digestive enzymes and gastric juices.\n\nWhen you think about eating a meal, see, and smell the food, your mouth begins to salivate. Your saliva has digestive enzymes and this is actually the BEGINNING of your digestion of food and absorption of nutrients.\n\nMost people drink water (and liquids) during a meal to help \u201cwash down\u201d the food. They mistakenly believe that it actually helps digestion \u2013 but the opposite is true.\n\nDrinking during your meal is a bad habit because it actually prevents you from chewing your food more thoroughly, which is part 2 of digestion.\n\nYou should take your time chewing your food, breaking it up into smaller pieces because it helps digest and absorb the nutrients. It also reduces digestive problems like gas, bloat, acid reflux, and so forth.\n\nUnfortunately, most people just vacuum up their food, barely chew it, and use liquids to push it down their throats and into their stomachs. This creates more of a burden in your stomach, leading to stomach and colon problems.\n\nLastly, this causes you to actually EAT more food because your brain has an automatic \u201cstop eating\u201d mechanism after about 20 minutes.\n\nThis is why SLOW eaters are usually thinner. They not only digest and absorb the foods better, but they also eat less food during that 20-minute time span.\n\nBy drinking water right after your meals, you are again tampering the natural time it takes for your food to digest. This also makes you feel hungrier faster and results in overeating and bloating.\n\nRemember, just because you\u2019re done eating, does NOT mean your body is done digesting. Depending on the calorie and macro content of the meal, your body will be digesting for another 2-3 hours.\n\nBut for sure, the main bulk of digestion happens for another 30-60 minutes.\n\nAgain, by drinking water (or any liquid) immediately before, during, and after your meal, dilutes essential gastric juices in your stomach, reducing digestion, and absorption of nutrients.\n\nFood also enters the large intestine much faster than it should, which causes stomach discomfort and worst of all \u2013 high blood sugar and insulin spikes.\n\nThis in turn causes you to feel tired and gain fat.\n\nSo When Should You Drink Your Water?\n\nAbout 30 minutes before your meal is the \u201clatest\u201d I suggest. So, if the food comes out at noon, drink your water no later than 11:30 and start eating at noon.\n\nAnd wait at least 30 minutes after a meal preferably 60 minutes, before drinking your water (and other liquids).\n\nNOW, if you really need to have some water during the meal because something got stuck in your throat or you had something spicy or whatever, then go ahead and have a little sip of room-temperature water. That\u2019s it.\n\nAnd if your goal is to lose weight, suppress your appetite, and eat less food \u2013 then I suggest you have 2-3 big cups (16 oz/1 liter or more) about 30-45 minutes before a meal. Add in a little bit of lemon juice and/or apple cider vinegar to balance your blood sugar levels.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a bonus tip if you want to still enjoy some of your favorite foods, lose weight, improve colon health, and also help improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels:\n\nTake fat and carb-blocking fiber supplements, such as CHEATmeals, with your water, 30-45 minutes before your meal.\n\nThis supplement contains special digestive enzymes and natural fibers that actually block about 30% of the bad sugars, carbs, and fats from being absorbed.\n\nSo you\u2019ll feel full, lose weight, and have better colon, cholesterol, and blood sugar health at the same time.\n\nSo there you have it, don\u2019t drink water or any liquids 30 min before, during, and 30 min after your meal.\n\nAdd in some CHEATmeals before your meal and you\u2019ll digest your food better, improve cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, and reduce gas, bloat, acid reflux, and other digestive problems.",

    "title": "How Does Metamucil Lower Cholesterol | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/cholesterol-se/how-does-metamucil-lower-cholesterol/",
    "content": "There are certainly many ways to tackle high cholesterol from eating a healthy diet, exercising, taking statins as prescribed by your doctor and more. However, one of the more interesting ways to help lower your cholesterol is by increasing the amount of fiber in your diet. For many people, Metamucil has become a daily drink to provide plenty of soluble fiber which may actually lower cholesterol significantly in the body.\n\nWhen taken with or just after meals, it can significantly reduce the amount of cholesterol absorbed into the body and thus allow other treatments or medications to work better.\n\nMetamucil is made up of psyllium which is a soluble fiber. Once it reaches your stomach, it transforms into a gel-type substance which traps some of the cholesterol from the meal in which you just consumed. Trapped in the gel, the cholesterol is then passed through the body without being absorbed and gets pushed out along with all the other waste. This means that by absorbing less cholesterol with your meals, your body can eventually reduce the harmful amount of cholesterol that is left over time.\n\nObviously, the less cholesterol you consume, the better the Metamucil will work to absorb what is there. This is why following a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet is highly recommended. It is important to take the Metamucil in the proper dosage otherwise complications in the digestive system may occur.\n\nThe Proper Dosage of Metamucil\n\nMetamucil comes in a powdered form that mixes with water, juice, tea, smoothies and any type of liquid that is to be consumed. You can also take capsules if you don\u2019t want to mix it in water or eat the wafers which provide all the psyllium that is needed. It is important that you drink a full glass of water no matter what form you take the Metamucil so that you are fully hydrated throughout the day. To take it with meals means that you can keep the dosage to its proper amount and spread throughout the day as well.\n\nThree servings are recommended which breaks down into one tablespoon or two wafers or two capsules at each meal. You can even take capsules that have calcium which means up to five capsules a day. A single dose of Metamucil is about 3 grams of fiber and it is recommended that you take about 7 grams of fiber each day to reduce your high cholesterol.\n\nHowever, it is important that you start slowly on your intake of Metamucil because the body is not ready for an increase of up to 7 grams per day of soluble fiber, so you\u2019ll want to start slowly and work your way up to avoid any unwanted side effects. If you take too much soluble fiber, you may suffer from feeling bloated, backed up, gassy or even have diarrhea.\n\nSo, it is recommended that you begin with just half a dose each day for several days. If you suffer no side effects you can increase that amount to the other half dose a day and then work your way up to the full amount. You may want to consult with your doctor about how much to take during this time so that you can lower your cholesterol count.\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

I hadn\u2019t seen him in almost a year. The home was amazing\u2026\n\nHowever, what I noticed immediately was how much weight he had gained.\n\nAnyway, I asked him about it and this was something he wanted to talk about. I asked him what changes had he made?\u2026 diet, exercise, medications, stress, etc.?\n\nHe said \u201cI swear to you, I\u2019ve done nothing different! In fact, I\u2019m eating most of my meals at home these days, so I can make sure the food is healthy.\u201d\n\nAnyway, as we sat down to eat, I quickly noticed how large the plates were. The spoons, forks, etc\u2026 were all super big.\n\nAs he was serving the food, he just kept piling it on the plate\u2026 more and more.\n\nHowever, on this huge plate, it looked just fine.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem like a lot of food.\n\nThere was plenty of room.\n\nI served my usual portion size. But in all honesty, it looked odd on the plate. There was way too much space.\n\nI sat down\u2026 started eating and he then quickly asked \u201chey, don\u2019t you like the food?\u201d\n\nI said \u201cyeah, of course\u2026 it all looks delicious\u201d\n\nHe then said \u201cbut you barely put any food on your plate\u201d.\n\nI thought to myself for a second \u201chmm\u2026 he\u2019s right, it does LOOK like that \u2026 even though it\u2019s my usual portion size\u201d\n\nAnd then it hit me\u2026 It only looks like a \u201clittle bit of food\u201d because these are GIANT plates!\n\nSo that\u2019s when it dawned on me\u2026\n\nThat the reason my friend has been gaining weight is because the bigger the plate size, the bigger the portion sizes and the more food on the plate.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know about you, but growing up, most of us were told to just eat everything on our plates.\n\nI told this to my friend and he said \u201cyeah, I eat everything on my plate \u2013 no matter how much food. We grew up broke, so I don\u2019t like to waste food.\u201d\n\nSo this is when I told him to just get smaller plates and I bet he\u2019ll lose weight because he\u2019ll be eating less food.\n\nHe replied back and said \u201cbut I have all of these new, expensive, big plates\u2026 now you want me to get smaller ones?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I said \u201cyes because even though you said you had made no changes, YOU DID\u2026 these big new plates are making you fat!\u201d\n\nI said \u201cjust do me a favor and use plates that are half the size of these for the next 3 months\u201d.\n\nWell, about 4 months later he sent a text saying he had lost about 25 lbs and he didn\u2019t change anything at all, other than using the smaller plates, bowls and cups.\n\nSmaller plates = smaller portion sizes = smaller calories.\n\nAnd by the way, this is clinically proven by the Journal of Consumer Research.\n\nThey examined 56 different research studies on the effects of smaller plates on consumption. They tested everything \u2014 breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, etc. Type of plates, bowls, cups, etc.\n\nThe end result showed that reducing the size of the plate, bowl or cup by 30%, reduced consumption by 30%\n\nLess food = less calories = faster weight loss!\n\nNow, something to take into consideration here is that genetics and psychology plays a big role in how much you weigh.\n\nAnd this is why when people are under extra stress, some eat more food (\u201cstress eaters\u201d) and gain weight \u2026. and some people simply lose their appetite when under stress and thus, lose weight.\n\nMy brother eats more food, while I eat less when I\u2019m stressed.\n\nGenetics plays a big role here.\n\nPersonally, I think this is fascinating and because of this, I started taking specific nutrients that helped improve my \u201cfat-burning\u201d hormones.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

Can they mess up your fasting routine?\n\nUnderstanding Fasting\n\nWhen you fast, you give your digestive system a break for some period of time.\n\nThis can lead to lower insulin levels and can also help your body tap into its fat stores to provide energy.\n\nFasting may offer various health benefits such as improved insulin sensitivity, weight management, and even potential longevity benefits, although further research is needed in this area.\n\nThere are different ways to fast:\n\nIntermittent Fasting (IF): Eating within a certain time window and fasting the rest of the day.\n\nExtended Fasting: Going without food for 24 hours or more.\n\nTime-Restricted Eating: Similar to IF but with shorter fasting periods.\n\nDo Supplements Break a Fast?\n\nNow, the big question. Do supplements break a fast? The answer depends on the type of supplement. Here\u2019s a quick guide:\n\nWater-soluble vitamins (B and C): Typically safe during fasting. They don\u2019t contain calories. Fat-Soluble Vitamins (A, D, E, K): These might break your fast if they come in oil-based capsules. Best taken with meals.\n\nSodium, Potassium, Magnesium: Usually fine. They don\u2019t have calories and can help prevent fasting-related headaches and muscle cramps.\n\nGreen Tea Extract, Ginger, Turmeric: Generally safe, but check for added sugars or fillers.\n\nBranched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs): Can spike insulin and break your fast. Best avoided.\n\nProtein Powders: These contain calories and will break a fast. Save them for your eating window.\n\nFish Oil, MCT Oil: Contains calories and fat, breaking your fast. Take them with meals instead.\n\nYour reason for fasting can influence which supplements you can take:\n\nFor Cellular Repair (Autophagy): Avoid anything with calories. Stick to water, black coffee, or plain tea.\n\nFor Weight Loss: Minor supplements might be okay, but non-caloric options are best for maximum benefits.\n\nFor Mental Clarity: Avoid anything that can spike blood sugar.\n\nSo, do supplements break a fast?\n\nIt depends.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and for over 25 years, people have asked me \u201cWhat\u2019s the best type of diet to lose weight\u201d?\n\nAnd of course, something I used to ask myself all the time\u2026\n\nAnd there are dozens of different diets and they all have pros and cons:\n\nand so on and so forth.\n\nAnd it can all get confusing, right?\u2026\n\nHowever, the truth is, at the end of the day \u2014 they ALL work.\n\nWhat ultimately matters is how many calories you take in, versus how many you burn off.\n\nIf you weigh 150 lbs and your metabolism burns 2000 calories, you\u2019ll need to eat LESS than 2000 calories daily to create a deficit and thus, lose fat/weight.\n\nConversely, you can burn MORE than 2000 calories with exercise or increasing your metabolism or similar \u201cburning\u201d tactics.\n\nOf course, the best combination for the fastest results is eating less and burning more at the same time.\n\nBut How Do You KEEP It Off Long-Term?\n\nHowever, it\u2019s one thing to lose weight, it\u2019s another thing to KEEP IT OFF!\n\nSome people lose 100 lbs, but it\u2019s the same 10 lbs, over and over again.\n\nSadly, most \u201cdieters\u201d gain all the weight back and an extra few pounds on top of it.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed is that most people will eventually \u201cgive up\u201d on a diet because it becomes too difficult to NOT eat some of their favorite foods.\n\nThey can\u2019t enjoy social events\u2026. Going to restaurants, parties, holidays and so forth.\n\nThis used to be my personal problem.\n\nI\u2019d go out, everyone is eating, having a great time \u2013 fatty foods, tasty desserts, lots of carbohydrates \u2013 and then there\u2019s me\u2026.\n\nEating a salad with chicken or fish and drinking water or some diet soda in the old days.\n\nI just felt left out.\n\nAnd if I did say \u201cscrew it\u201d, I\u2019m going to eat whatever I want \u2013 I\u2019d feel guilty afterward or bloated or slow and that wasn\u2019t good either.\n\nHowever, one day I was out with a friend of mine, who was in great shape and he was 12 years older than me.\n\nEvery time we\u2019d go out, eat a ton of foods, and NOT the \u201chealthy\u201d stuff either.\n\nI noticed before every meal, he\u2019d take a bunch of pills. I asked him what that was all about and he said:\n\n\u201cThese two pills are fat blockers.\n\nThese two are carbohydrate and sugar blockers.\n\nAnd this one is a digestive enzyme.\n\nI take these pills before any meal that isn\u2019t super healthy or I want to eat more of because they block about 30% of the calories \u2013 specifically, fats and carbs.\n\nThus, it doesn\u2019t get absorbed. I just poop it out basically.\n\nAnd the combination is a great source of fiber \u2013 so it keeps me regular and lowers my cholesterol and blood sugar at the same time.\n\nOf course, I thought it was too good to be true. I mean, you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too, AND lose weight \u2026 or could you?\u2026\n\nSo, I gave it a try and he was right.\n\nI didn\u2019t gain any weight.\n\nI was more regular and that kept my stomach much flatter.\n\nI felt good and I was happy.\n\nI still got to enjoy some of my favorite foods, in moderation of course \u2026 and did so without feeling guilty or deprived or gaining any weight.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve been doing this and using the same \u201cformula\u201d for almost 25 years now.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve made some improvements to it.\n\nAn important fact to keep in mind is that a major problem with dieting and eating less is your metabolism slows down.\n\nThis way, my metabolism stays fast because I\u2019m eating more calories, yet I don\u2019t gain weight because a big chunk of calories are being blocked.\n\nSo it\u2019s a win/win situation for my metabolism.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you can go eat unlimited amounts of pizza and ice cream every day.\n\nHowever, during special events, parties, holidays, going out with friends, dates or when you have that craving that needs to be satisfied, you can now do so without feeling guilty.\n\nAnyway, give this new & improved formula a try and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Carb, Sugar & Fat BLOCKING\" Shortcut\n\nOne of the biggest problems with \"dieting\" is the fact you can't eat some of your favorite foods.\n\nThis is especially difficult when you go out - such as restaurants, parties, the holidays, date-night and other social events.\n\nHowever, the great news is that there's a special way that you can actually BLOCK those \"bad\" calories (sugars, carbs and fats) from your favorite foods from being absorbed.\n\nThe end result is \"you can have your cake and eat it too\"... And STILL lose weight! It's utilizing ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Hey everyone, it\u2019s Dr. Sam Robbins here, ready to dive into how you can supercharge your health by adding nitric oxide-rich foods to your diet.\n\nNo matter your gender, boosting your nitric oxide levels can significantly enhance your overall well-being, from improving heart health to enhancing exercise performance.\n\nUnderstanding Nitric Oxide\u2019s Role\n\nNitric oxide is a natural molecule your body makes that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions.\n\nIt\u2019s especially important for dilating blood vessels, which improves blood flow and lowers blood pressure.\n\nFor those looking to boost their physical performance or improve cardiovascular health, enhancing your body\u2019s nitric oxide production is key.\n\nIf you suffer from erectile dysfunction because of the restricted blood flow to the penis, nitric oxide can also help.\n\nThe Best Foods for Boosting Nitric Oxide\n\nIncorporating foods high in nitric oxide into your meals is a easy way to help increase your body\u2019s levels. Here are some top picks:\n\nLeafy Greens: Spinach, arugula, and kale are loaded with nitrates, which your body converts to nitric oxide.\n\nBeets: This superfood is not only good for boosting nitric oxide but also for endurance and recovery.\n\nGarlic: Enhances nitric oxide production and also brings other cardiovascular benefits.\n\nPomegranates: Known for antioxidant properties and boosting nitric oxide.\n\nDark Chocolate: Choose varieties with high cocoa content to reap benefits related to blood flow and heart health.\n\nBoosting Nitric Oxide Beyond Diet\n\nWhile diet is crucial, sometimes you need an extra push, especially when dealing with lifestyle or health factors that can decrease nitric oxide levels.\n\nThis is where supplements can play a role. One such supplement I recommend is Blood Flow Optimizer, which not only supports healthy circulation but also aids in maintaining optimal levels of nitric oxide in your body.\n\nBlood Flow Optimizer is formulated with ingredients that help promote blood circulation and arterial health, which are essential for effective nitric oxide utilization.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple, safe, and natural way to support your heart health and enhance your physical stamina and recovery.\n\nIntegrating Nitric Oxide-Rich Foods into Your Diet\n\nTo make the most out of these nitric oxide-rich foods, try these tips:\n\nSalads: Toss plenty of leafy greens with a vinaigrette made with a touch of garlic.\n\nSmoothies: Blend up a beet and pomegranate smoothie for a refreshing and nutritious drink.\n\nSnacks: Dark chocolate can be a great post-meal treat to satisfy your sweet tooth while boosting your health.\n\nBy understanding the power of nitric oxide and incorporating foods rich in this compound, you can take a significant step toward improving your health.\n\nRemember, while diet is foundational, supplements like Blood Flow Optimizer can offer additional support, ensuring that your body maintains optimal nitric oxide levels for better health and performance.\n\nSo, why not give your body the boost it needs and enjoy the benefits of a well-rounded approach to wellness?",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/cholesterol/the-shocking-truth-about-shrimp-high-cholesterol/",
    "content": "I\u2019ve decided to update this article in 2025 since it got great feedback and it\u2019s a very important topic.\n\nI\u2019ve got a friend named Frank, who just LOVES shrimp. Whenever we go out to eat, he has to have it. And he\u2019s always posting some shrimp meal or dish on his Facebook page.\n\nSo, a few nights ago, when he ordered a bunch of shrimp for dinner, my other friend, Howard asked, \u201chey, aren\u2019t you concerned with your cholesterol, eating so much shrimp all the time? We\u2019re not 20 years old anymore.\u201d\n\nFrank, my shrimp-eating friend replied back by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have this every day, probably 3-4x weekly. Besides, you only live once\u2026 you worry too much.\u201d and then he proceeded to order a glass of beer.\n\nSo then, Howard, our \u201canti-shrimp\u201d friend turned to me and asked, \u201cwhat do you think Sam?\u2026 Do you eat shrimp? Isn\u2019t it bad for your health?\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck between two friends I\u2019ve known for almost 20 years.\n\nHowever, the truth is the truth, let me share with you, what I basically told my friends.\n\nShrimp And Cholesterol\n\nYes, shrimp has a lot of cholesterol. A small 3 oz serving has about 200 mg of cholesterol.\n\nOn paper, that\u2019s as much cholesterol as you need for ONE day, not counting all the other sources of food.\n\nAnd yes, shrimp also raises your cholesterol levels \u2013 both total and LDL, the \u201cbad\u201d lipoprotein.\n\nHowever, it ALSO raises your \u201cgood\u201d HDL1 and for some people, even more than the bad LDL \u2026 so the end result is a better ratio, which is the more important factor.\n\nSo, depending on your genetics, eating shrimp isn\u2019t going to be a problem for cholesterol\u2026 as long as you don\u2019t overdo it.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll come back to this cholesterol topic in a minute because there\u2019s something else to add to it.\n\nBut I want to answer my friend\u2019s second question:\n\nThe answer is, no. I never order it or buy it. If it\u2019s at a party, I\u2019ll have a couple of pieces one in a rare while, but the bottom line is \u2014 NO, I don\u2019t eat shrimp.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much because of the cholesterol. Because I do have cholesterol in my diet. It\u2019s important to do so, at least in some amounts and it varies from person to person.\n\nHowever, if I\u2019m going to have a protein with cholesterol, I\u2019d rather it be whole eggs. It has a lot more nutrients than shrimp and I prefer the taste. It\u2019s also a better source of protein.\n\nIf I\u2019m going to have seafood, I\u2019d rather have wild-caught salmon. Again, I think it\u2019s more nutritious and a far healthier source of protein and seafood than shrimp. I also like the taste of salmon better.\n\nShrimp and other shellfish are \u201cbottom feeders\u201d. Basically, they eat \u201cjunk\u201d at the bottom of the ocean. I know that this is a controversial topic, and there are healthy fish such as Sardines, which are also classified as \u201cbottom feeders\u201d. However, my personal preference is to not eat these bottom feeders \u2013 shrimp and other shellfish included.\n\nShellfish, including shrimp, is classified as one of the top eight food allergies in the US, along with peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, milk, and soy.2,3\n\nHowever, most importantly, shrimp is the most popular seafood in the US. This also means that over 90% of it gets imported from other countries. Sadly, less than 2% get inspected by the FDA and US regulatory agencies.\n\nWhat this means is that the shrimp is farm-raised in dirty and unhealthy conditions. They feed on unhealthy food. Imported shrimp, more than any other seafood, has been found to be contaminated with banned chemicals, pesticides, and antibiotics.\n\nSo, these and a few other reasons are why I personally don\u2019t have shrimp.\n\nBut What About My Higher Cholesterol?\n\nNow, coming back to the cholesterol topic. IF you are concerned about having high cholesterol, have a family history of it, or taking a cholesterol-lowering drug \u2014 then I would reconsider having Shrimp.\n\nOr limit it to once or twice weekly at the most. And make sure it\u2019s wild-caught, NOT farm-raised shrimp.\n\nAnd there are natural ways of lowering your cholesterol while improving your HDL/LDL ratios and triglycerides and other \u201cheart health\u201d markers.\n\nI\u2019d like to share with you a natural formula that my own parents have been using since 1999, to lower their cholesterol by 30 pts in only 30 days. It\u2019s clinically proven and something I would highly advise using, instead of toxic, cholesterol-lowering drugs.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/64/5/712.abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241964/pdf/nihms247178.pdf\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3312744/pdf/nihms-363930.pdf",

It\u2019s normal to feel depressed or sad once in a while.\n\nTo cry because you\u2019re feeling sad, empty, or lonely\u2026\n\nHowever, if these deep feelings of sadness or hopelessness continue for extended periods of time\u2026\n\nOr have slowly become a part of your daily life and are preventing you from enjoying life, interacting with people, and feeling normal and happy, then we need to make some changes in your \u201cbiochemistry\u201d.\n\nBy eating certain foods, we can optimize your \u201chappy\u201d hormones and neurotransmitters, to help minimize depressive feelings and quickly improve your mood.\n\nREMEMBER \u2013 Life is meant to be LIVED, not simply \u201csurvived\u201d from one day to the next.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started with the 5 foods that are clinically proven to help minimize feelings of sadness and instantly improve your mood.\n\nGreen Tea is great because it contains an amino acid called L-Theanine, which is clinically proven to help reduce depressive feelings while helping create calmness at the same time.\n\nL-theanine works by increasing the activity of neurotransmitters GABA and Dopamine1,2,3\n\nDrink at least 3-4 cups daily or take L-Theanine pills.\n\nIt\u2019s important to eat wild-caught Salmon at least 2-3x weekly because of the omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential to brain health.\n\nPeople with mood changes have added or increased their omega 3\u2019s and their symptoms immediately got better.4,5\n\nThere are three types of omega-3 fatty acids: ALA, EPA, and DHA. Of the three, EPA appears to be the best at fighting depressive feelings.6\n\nIn fact, one study even found EPA to be as effective against depressive feelings as the antidepressant drug, Prozac.7\n\nIf you don\u2019t like fish, at least take 2-3 grams of omega fish oil pills daily.\n\nEat foods high in Magnesium, such as Spinach, pumpkin seeds, and almonds.\n\nMagnesium plays a critical role in brain function and mood, and low levels are linked to an increased risk of mood changes.8\n\nOne analysis of over 8,800 people found that those under the age of 65 years, with the lowest intake of magnesium, had a 32% greater risk of depressive feelings.9\n\nI personally add in an extra 800 mg daily of Magnesium, right before bed because it also helps with relaxation and sleep.\n\nWhole eggs are very important for overall health, and especially brain and mood health.\n\nThis is because egg yolks contain cholesterol, which is needed to create many of your sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, etc.), which all affect your mood.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, cholesterol from eggs won\u2019t raise your cholesterol levels.\n\nHowever, having low cholesterol is linked to depressive feelings.10\n\nEggs also contain zinc, B12, and fat-soluble vitamins such as D and K. Being deficient in any of these is linked to higher levels of depressive feelings.11,12\n\nFoods high in probiotics are very important for your mood.\n\nYour gut bacteria is linked to many health ailments \u2014 heart and blood sugar problems and even more so \u2014 mood and happiness.13,14,15\n\nYogurt, Kefir, Sauerkraut, Tempeh, Kimchi, and similar foods are very high in healthy bacteria and pro and pre-biotics. Make sure you\u2019re having some daily.\n\nIf not, at least take some probiotic pills daily.\n\nThere are many lifestyle changes you can make, that can and will make dramatic improvements in your mood.\n\nHormones control how we look and feel.\n\n\u201cMotion creates emotion\u201d.\n\nThe words you use and the people you associate with and many more actions that you have total control over can help decrease and eliminate depressive and similar negative feelings.\n\nOne thing is for sure, most people don\u2019t need drugs to fight feelings of sadness. There are natural and proven solutions that work better and are safer than drugs!\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17182482\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296328\n\nhttps://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jphs/105/2/105_2_211/_article\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178115003844\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X03000324\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22910528\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048670701827275\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23950577\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25748766\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710104/\n\nhttp://www.neurology.org/content/56/9/1188.1.short\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12656203\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619611607027\n\nhttp://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-med-012510-175505\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972297",

We\u2019re going to check out foods that are not just good for you but also taste great.\n\nReady to give your body a natural hormone boost? Let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhy Testosterone Matters\n\nTestosterone is a big deal for guys. It helps with muscles, bones, libido, and staying in a good mood.\n\nBut as you get older, your testosterone levels might drop, messing with your health and happiness.\n\nKeeping your testosterone levels up is crucial. It means more muscle, better bone density, a happier libido, and more get-up-and-go.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s good for your brain, helping keep the blues at bay.\n\nFoods to Boost Testosterone\n\nYour diet has a huge role in your testosterone levels. Some foods have nutrients that get your testosterone production on the move. Let\u2019s see what foods can help you out.\n\nZinc is your friend here. Foods like oysters, beef, lamb, pumpkin seeds, and spinach are packed with it. Zinc helps your body make more testosterone.\n\nVitamin D is another hero for testosterone. You can find it in fatty fish, fortified dairy, and egg yolks. Getting enough vitamin D helps keep your testosterone at the right level.\n\nProtein isn\u2019t just about building muscle; it\u2019s key for making testosterone, too.\n\nEat plenty of lean meats, fish, eggs, and dairy.\n\nIf you\u2019re into plant-based eating, go for legumes, tofu, and tempeh. Mixing up your protein sources is a smart move.\n\nVitamins and Minerals for Hormones\n\nBesides zinc and vitamin D, other nutrients help with hormones.\n\nVitamin A (think carrots and spinach) and selenium (found in Brazil nuts and fish) are super important for keeping your testosterone on track.\n\nSpecific nutrients and natural herbs can really make a difference in testosterone levels.\n\nHealthy Fats Are Your Friends\n\nHealthy fats are good for your hormones.\n\nFoods rich in omega-3s like fatty fish, flaxseeds, and chia seeds; olive oil; avocados; and nuts help your body make testosterone.\n\nCruciferous Veggies for the Win\n\nVeggies like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale do more than keep you healthy. They can help manage your estrogen and boost your testosterone.\n\nTasty Testosterone-Boosting Meals\n\nLet\u2019s get to the good stuff \u2013 the food. Here are some meal ideas:\n\nOyster and Spinach Stir-Fry: Zinc heaven. Cook up some oysters and spinach with garlic and olive oil. It\u2019s tasty and boosts your testosterone.\n\nGrilled Salmon with Avocado Salsa: Omega-3s and healthy fats in one delicious meal. Marinate salmon, grill it, and top with avocado salsa.\n\nChicken and Veggie Skewers: Protein-packed and full of flavor. Marinate chicken, thread it on skewers with veggies, and grill.\n\nPlan Ahead: Pick a day to plan your meals. Write down what you\u2019ll eat and make a shopping list.\n\nPrep Early: Cut up veggies, marinate meat, and cook grains ahead of time. It saves time later.\n\nCook in Batches: Make more than you need and freeze the extras. It\u2019s a lifesaver on busy days.\n\nOther Tips for Healthy Testosterone\n\nEating right is just part of the picture. Exercise, good sleep, and stress management also play huge roles in keeping your testosterone levels healthy.\n\nMove Your Body: Exercise, especially lifting weights, can boost your testosterone.\n\nSleep Well: Aim for 7-9 hours of good sleep. It\u2019s crucial for your hormones. If you are a bad sleeper, try Deep Sleep Formula \u2013 it will help to fall asleep faster and stay a sleep longer.\n\nChill Out: Find ways to relax and lower stress. Your hormones will thank you.\n\nBoosting your testosterone naturally is all about eating right, staying active, getting enough sleep, and managing stress.\n\nRegardless of age, you CAN improve your testosterone, naturally. Try to improve your habits \u2013 diet, sleep, stress, and exercise can all affect your levels.\n\nFocus on foods that fuel your hormone health. Simple meals for testosterone will help.\n\nStart making these changes today, and you\u2019ll see the difference they make in how you feel and live. Your body will thank you for it!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "\ud83d\udca7Everything You Need To Know About Drinking Water In 2025",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/everything-you-want-need-to-know-about-drinking-water/",
    "content": "I believe water is one of the most important nutrients in the world. I mean, it has to be because without it, you\u2019d die in 2-3 days.\n\nUnfortunately, most people don\u2019t drink enough and when they do, they drink the WRONG kind.\n\nI\u2019ve done a couple of articles about this recently:\n\nWhen Drinking Water Is BAD For Your Health\n\nBest Times To Drink Water for Health, Fitness & Longevity\n\nAnd today is basically part 3: everything you want and need to know about drinking water.\n\nI\u2019ll cover all the various forms, benefits, and negatives. And, what I personally drink most of the time.\n\nOkay, so let\u2019s get started\u2026\n\nMost of the world doesn\u2019t have clean water, even tap water. And some places, like Canada, has really good tap water. However, what comes out of your faucet isn\u2019t really that good for drinking.\n\nTap water is filled with trace amounts of drugs \u2013 birth control hormones, blood pressure, cholesterol, antibiotics, and all sorts of other drugs. In fact, there have been over 300 man-made chemicals found in drinking water.1\n\nThere are other toxic chemicals and minerals such as chlorine, lead, and fluoride \u2013 all of which are very bad for your health.\n\nLastly, tap water tends to be very acidic. Again, not good for your health.\n\nEven though tap water is cheap and convenient, it doesn\u2019t mean you should drink it. Go ahead and wash your clothes, clean the dishes, water the lawn, and boil water if you need to \u2013 but, save the DRINKING water to other types that I\u2019ll mention today.\n\nMineral water has been said to contain up to four times as much calcium and magnesium as regular tap water. This has a lot of benefits.\n\nJust don\u2019t use this type of water for deposit-building appliances \u2013 such as kettles, irons, and coffee machines.\n\nFor these types of appliances, you want to use distilled water because it does not contain minerals. This is because this type of water has had many of its impurities removed through distillation. In fact, this is what we used in medical school for a lot of our science experiments.\n\nDistillation involves boiling the water and then condensing the steam into a clean container.\n\nDistilled water tends to be acidic and can only be recommended as a way of drawing poisons out of the body. Once this is accomplished, the continued drinking of distilled water is a bad idea.\n\nDeionized water, is simply water from which the ions have been removed. It\u2019s typically used in laboratory situations where the presence of ions would cause interference or other problems. Important. But, this isn\u2019t water you\u2019d drink.\n\nThis is the type of water you see in most generic, bottled waters. Spring water is often mistaken for being equal or interchangeable with purified water (which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute). However, spring water often contains many of the same impurities found in well or tap water. In fact, since springs feed our rivers, there is a lot of spring water in our tap water!\n\nUnfortunately, many spring water companies advertise their water as \u201c100% pure\u2014\u201d However, this is typically misleading. It\u2019s NOT \u201cpurified\u201d water. It\u2019s not as clean.\n\nSimply stated, most spring water is almost the same as regular \u201ctap\u201d water and in fact, almost always it IS from tap water.\n\nThe only REAL difference is that when the water is at the bottling facility, it goes through a carbon filtration process to remove the chlorine. This process may separate spring from tap water, but nitrates, metals, fluoride, and other \u201ctoxins\u201d are likely to remain.\n\nNow, if the spring water is from melted glacial ice or a similar natural source, then this type of water is actually very good and helps hydrate the body very well.\n\nPurified water tends to be one of the healthiest because it\u2019s very \u201cpure\u201d and yet, still full of essential minerals like Calcium, Magnesium, and Potassium that your body needs.\n\nThe source of purified water isn\u2019t what makes it the best choice on the market\u2014it\u2019s the purification methods that separate purified water from the rest of the pack.\n\nPurified water goes through a process similar to what filtered water goes through but with a few added steps like reverse osmosis, distillation, or deionization. The end result is far purer than filtered, spring, or tap water.\n\nAlkaline Water is water that is at a pH level of 8 and above, which is higher than the pH of regular water. It has become more popular because research shows that an alkaline diet is generally good for health.2,3\n\nI personally like alkaline water because I think most problems and diseases, due to modern lifestyles, stress levels, the type of foods we eat, and so forth \u2013 cause our bodies to be more acidic and thus, we need to be \u201calkalized\u201d. Eating a more vegetable-based diet is a great start, with more minerals as well \u2013 and Alkaline water is another great choice.\n\nReverse Osmosis Water\n\nThis is a common filtration method in many bottled waters because it produces very pure water. It is used in almost all home and commercial \u201cdrinking water\u201d machines such as those in water stores, supermarkets, and health food stores. It is also used industrially in bottling plants for soda pop, soups, juices, beer, and many other drinks.\n\nThe good part about this type of water is that it has a very low level of toxic metals, toxic chemicals, and pathogens, and its low cost.\n\nHowever, the bad part is that it\u2019s also mineral free and thus, it doesn\u2019t hydrate the body as well. It also tends to have a more acidic pH, which I\u2019m not a fan of.\n\nThis is water that contains hydrogen molecules that act as powerful antioxidants. The claim is these molecules are capable of helping your body neutralize harmful free radicals that contribute to disease development, reduce inflammation, and slow down aging.\n\nIn studies, hydrogen water has been shown to have mild anti-inflammatory effects, particularly on the development of diseases like Parkinson\u2019s.4\n\nMany of the big health claims are still inconclusive when similar studies were performed on human beings. Yet, some of the health claims are presented as fact even though there are no guarantees. Also, all the hype makes this type of water very expensive to buy.\n\nI think a combination of water because in all honesty, I don\u2019t think anyone knows exactly what\u2019s the best type of water, nor what we are REALLY getting in the water.\n\nIf I buy bottled water, I typically purchase Penta because it has a good pH, very good filtration, all the contaminants have been removed, good plastic is used, and few other benefits.\n\nI will also buy Fiji water, it also has a good pH and has minerals too.\n\nFinally, I will also try to get in a bottle of San Pellegrino daily (in glass bottles only). I like the bubbles and it has a lot of good minerals, most notably, sulfate. Our bodies need the right amounts of minerals, and sulfates are harder to get and unappreciated. The benefits of getting more sulfates are diverse, supporting joint, muscle, heart, and nervous system health and detox.5\n\nYes, these 3 are more expensive waters. But again, I\u2019m not buying only bottled water.\n\nAt home, I use 2 options. I do have a reverse osmosis filtration in my kitchen, which I use about half of the time. And yes, I know it has lower minerals. It\u2019s fine, I add in a lot of specific minerals into my diet, including salts.\n\nAnd, I use a good, activated charcoal type of filtration pitcher such as Brita Pitcher because it also removes 97% of chlorine and 99% of lead.\n\nI covered a lot of the basics of water. Just know that there\u2019s never \u201ca best\u201d or \u201conly\u201d anything in life. This is because there\u2019s only so much control we have over what we buy and what the label says or what the company REALLY does with its products.\n\nAnd the bigger the company, the more they do things towards PROFIT, rather than health.\n\nThe bottom line is to do your best to at the very least, drink some extra water, for sure first thing in the morning. NO other liquid will do what water does and should NOT be a substitute for water.\n\nDo your best to drink about 96 oz of water daily or about 3 liters.\n\nAnd drink away from your meals \u2013 thus, not immediately before, during, or after. It impedes digestion.\n\nhttps://www.water-for-health.co.uk/our-blog/2017/10/whats-healthiest-water-can-drink/\n\nJournal of Environmental and Public Health: The Alkaline Diet: Is There Evidence That an Alkaline pH Diet Benefits Health?\n\n3 Benefits of Alkaline Water based on Clinical Research\n\nMedical Gas Research: Drinking Hydrogen Water\u2026 Prevent 6-Hydorxydopamine-Induced Parkinson\u2019s Disease In Rats.\n\nhttp://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/14/12/2492",

    "content": "I\u2019m going to get right to the point today, stop eating vegetable and \u201cseed\u201d oils such as:\n\nSoybean oil. Canola oil. Corn oil. Cottonseed oil. Sunflower oil. Peanut oil. Sesame oil. Rice bran oil.\n\nThese fats can cause multiple health problems, such as:\n\nincreased body fat due to poor blood sugar levels\n\ninflammation and pain\n\nhigher cholesterol levels\n\nincrease in blood pressure\n\n\u2026 accelerated aging of the skin, hair and organs\n\nEven though they aren\u2019t really vegetables, these oils are commonly referred to as \u201cvegetable oils.\u201d\n\nThese oils contain very large amounts of biologically active fats called Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are harmful in excess.\n\nHowever, this does NOT apply to healthy plant oils like olive oil or coconut oil, which are extremely good for you.\n\nIndustrial seed oils like corn, cottonseed, safflower, soybean, and sunflower are not foods we should look to increase in our diets. These are fake, man-made fats.\n\nThese oils were never a significant contributor to the human diet until the past 50 years and this is because they\u2019re cheap.\n\nRemember, these plants are not potent fat sources, especially corn. To concentrate the oil and make it usable, it has to be exposed to high heat, degummed, refined, bleached, deodorized, and other nasty stuff to produce a cheap, clear oil with a long shelf life.\n\nThese oils are now devoid of the healthy polyphenols that provide antioxidant protection for the easily oxidized polyunsaturated fats.\n\nImbalance Between Omega 6 & Omega 3 Fats\n\nThere are two types of fatty acids that are termed \u201cessential\u201d \u2013 because the body can\u2019t produce them.\n\nThese are the Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.\n\nIt is absolutely essential for the human body to get these fatty acids from the diet, but it must get them in a certain balance.\n\nWhile humans were evolving, our Omega-6: Omega-3 ratio may have been around 3:1 to 1:2. Almost similar amounts of each.\n\nToday, our ratio is as high as 20:1 on average, with even higher ratios towards Omega 6\u2019s with those who eat more processed/packaged foods \u2013 as well as eating out most of your meals.1\n\nThe higher Omega 6 fat ratio is known to cause heart problems, inflammation, arthritis, and weight gain.\n\nVegetable Oils Are High In \u201cTrans Fats\u201d\n\nIn addition to the omega 6 ratio problems, vegetable oils are high in \u201ctrans fats\u201d.\n\nThese fats are highly toxic and are associated with an increased risk of various health problems.\n\nAnd these trans fats are found in the vegetable oils you see on the shelves, which have a very LONG and unnatural shelf-life. They are ALSO found in most baked goods because they\u2019re cheap and extend the shelf-life of these packaged products.\n\nBad For Heart Health & Cholesterol Levels\n\nPolyunsaturated fats are promoted to help \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol (lipoprotein), however \u2026 they ALSO decrease the more important, beneficial \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol (lipoprotein) as well and to a great extent \u2014 so, what\u2019s the point?!!\n\nThis imbalance is another reason these vegetable oils increase your risk for heart problems.9-11\n\nThey can increase cholesterol levels, even though you\u2019re not eating any cholesterol and you \u201cthink\u201d you\u2019re eating healthy.\n\nEat More Healthy Fats\n\nYou need to have fat in your diet, it\u2019s essential to your survival and health.\n\nJust stay away from these unhealthy, fake fats and read all the labels for these hidden fats.\n\nI suggest that a minimum of at least 15% of your calories come from healthy fats such as\n\nextra virgin olive oil\n\nnuts such as walnuts and pistachio\n\nfatty fish such a wild-caught salmon\n\nfish oil pills (about 2-4 grams daily)\n\nMake sure you continue reading labels since vegetable oils are in most foods, especially processed foods.\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332206002435 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16841861 http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/83/6/S1483.abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19022225 http://www.docsopinion.com/2013/05/03/inflammation-and-heart-disease/ http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199008163230703 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9322581 http://jn.nutrition.org/content/135/3/562.short https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2166702/ http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=662108 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4684-0967-3_18\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332206002435\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16841861\n\nhttp://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/83/6/S1483.abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19022225\n\nhttp://www.docsopinion.com/2013/05/03/inflammation-and-heart-disease/\n\nhttp://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199008163230703\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9322581\n\nhttp://jn.nutrition.org/content/135/3/562.short\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2166702/\n\nhttp://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=662108\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4684-0967-3_18",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/5-ways-to-get-ripped-build-muscle-at-the-same-time/",
    "content": "Growing up, I noticed and observed lots of things and one of them was that there were two kinds of guys when it came to eating carbs.\n\nThe guys that could eat them and would be muscular, hard, full, lean, and get energized.\n\nAnd the other guy, that would be puffy, soft, and would get sleepy and tired after eating carbs.\n\nUnfortunately, I was the second guy.\n\nSo at that young age, I assumed that my body didn\u2019t do well with carbs because of my genetics.\n\nAnd so, I started a low carb diet.\n\nI also took it to the extreme of a no-carb, ketogenic diet as well.\n\nBut I\u2019ll talk about that in a different article.\n\nBut mostly, I stuck to low carbs for many months, over a year in fact.\n\nThe good news is that I saw results.\n\nYou first quickly see results because you lose a lot of water weight. And this is because every 1 gram of carbs, holds about 3 grams of water.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not fat loss, but the scale shows improvements in weight loss and you look better with less water retention.\n\nInitially, I also was more energetic having low carbs.\n\nUnfortunately, the problem was my workouts sucked. I had very little stamina. I couldn\u2019t do as many sets or reps.\n\nAnd worst of all, I couldn\u2019t get a deep contraction in my muscles and I rarely got a good pump.\n\nWhich in all honesty is a big reason I enjoy my workouts.\n\nWithout a big pump, I feel like I didn\u2019t even workout. I feel like I\u2019m just going through the motions.\n\nI leave the gym dissatisfied.\n\nEven Arnold compares a pump to cumming \u2026\n\nThe end result is that even though I did lose weight, a lot of it was also water and valuable muscle weight over time.\n\nPlus, after a few months, I started to get more and more tired.\n\nSomething in my body was changing but in a bad way.\n\nWhen I did a blood test, I found out my thyroid levels had dropped dramatically.\n\nWhich later I found out is due to low carbs.\n\nBy the way, this negatively affects women more than men.\n\nMy body had completely adapted to the low-carb diet. I couldn\u2019t cut carbs any lower. And soon, I became skinny/fat \u2013 rather than muscular and lean.\n\nYes, I lost fat, but I also lost a lot of hard-earned, valuable muscle.\n\nI also had lower thyroid, which meant slower metabolism and fat burning.\n\nMy cortisol levels were also higher due to the low carbs. Cortisol is a powerful stress hormone that causes muscle loss and belly fat.\n\nIt can be a really bad hormone and I\u2019ll discuss this topic in a future article.\n\nThe Problem Is NOT Carbs\n\nThis was all in my early 20s and I didn\u2019t know as much as I know now, obviously.\n\nHowever, I was lucky and had a great mentor, Dan Duchaine, who I later became his assistant.\n\nDan Duchaine was known as the \u201csteroid guru\u201d and I learned so much from him. He helped me when nobody else would or could.\n\nHe was honest and made things really easy to understand.\n\nHe told me that my problem was not carbs, but that the fact I had poor insulin sensitivity.\n\nHe said by improving insulin sensitivity, I could eat more carbs and that would be utilized for building muscle, more energy, and burning fat.\n\nI would have better workouts and thus, be able to build more muscle and that also means less body fat.\n\nMy thyroid would improve, my cortisol levels would drop, my IGF levels would also rise \u2013 which is one of the most potent muscle-building hormones in the body.\n\nAnd to make a long story short, I did what he told me and over the next few months, I made more improvements in my body than the previous 2 years combined.\n\nAll by simply improving my insulin sensitivity, which improved my blood sugar levels and lots of other hormones.\n\nI ate more carbs, gained more muscle, got leaner, had amazing workouts, and had great pumps again.\n\nI was excited, motivated, and enjoying my workouts.\n\nI improved one of the most powerful and important hormones in the body, insulin.\n\nWhich when used correctly can either build you lots of muscle or lots of fat.\n\nIn fact, this is why some bodybuilders will use injectable insulin. Of course, you don\u2019t need to do such extreme drugs which can literally kill you.\n\nYou can easily do it naturally.\n\nAnd for the past 25+ years since I learned about the importance of managing insulin and blood sugar levels, I\u2019ve done everything possible to keep insulin sensitivity high and optimize my insulin levels.\n\nWhich by the way, will dramatically improve your health in every aspect. But, I\u2019ll discuss that in another article.\n\nTop 5 Ways To Improve Insulin Sensitivity & Build Muscle\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to give you my top 5 best ways to improve insulin sensitivity naturally, so you can also build more muscle, get leaner, and live a longer and healthier life.\n\nOne last thing to let you know \u2013 the older we get, the worse the insulin sensitivity becomes. Thus, you really need to make this a priority and take action on what you\u2019ll learn today.\n\nThe greatest thing you can do is build more muscle.\n\nThis means you must lift weights\u2026 this can be with barbells, dumbbells, machines, cables, bands, your body weight, and so forth.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re young or old, male or female \u2013 everyone can build more muscle!\n\nNow, when it comes to your workouts, do them frequently. This means I\u2019d rather you worked out 20 min, 6 days a week. Instead of 40 min 3x a week.\n\nI\u2019d rather you did 15 minutes, twice daily \u2013 instead of 30 minutes, once daily.\n\nEvery time you move and contract your muscles, you increase your insulin sensitivity.\n\nAlso, super long workouts with lots of volume, sets, and reps\u2026 deplete glycogen and glucose from your muscles and liver, and increase the stress hormone cortisol, which then decreases testosterone, which we do NOT want.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll talk about this specific topic in a future article because it\u2019s very important.\n\nThe sad truth is that most supplements suck. They don\u2019t work because they are using the wrong ingredients, the wrong form at the wrong dosage.\n\nHowever, there are a few correctly formulated supplements that really work and will help support healthy blood sugar and insulin sensitivity.\n\nAnd when used at the correct dose, they can have drug-like positive effects, but without the negatives.\n\nBy far, the best all-in-one formula is Blood Sugar Optimizer. It\u2019s a product I use myself.\n\nJust take 1-2 pills, with your carb meals \u2013 especially after your workouts.\n\nIt\u2019s clinically validated and it really works.\n\nI\u2019ve put the link to Blood Sugar Optimizer here for you to click, along with a special coupon for my blog readers.\n\nBlood Sugar Optimizer and Fish Oils are my two favorite supplements for healthy insulin and blood sugar levels.\n\nFor fish oil, take 1-2 grams, 3x daily with food. I take the raw oil because it\u2019s cheaper than me taking a bunch of pills.\n\nBut, most people won\u2019t do this.\n\nSo you can take 2 pills of fish oil and 2 pills of Blood Sugar Optimizer, 3x daily with food and you will start to see some very cool body composition changes over the next few months.\n\nI\u2019ve put links to the fish oils I take\u2026 check them here and here.\n\nFiber also has lots of great health benefits, one of them being improving insulin sensitivity.\n\nBesides, most people\u2019s diets have very little fiber.\n\nI take psyllium fiber, 2-3x daily for a total of at least 5 GRAMS of fiber daily.\n\nFor this, I take the pill, since I don\u2019t like the powder.\n\nYou can check out the links above.\n\nSleep is awesome and it fixes so many problems in the body. Deeper sleep lowers the stress hormone cortisol and also improves insulin sensitivity.\n\nI\u2019ll be doing an entire article series about improving sleep in the near future. It\u2019s too complicated of a topic to get into right now.\n\nBut, one tip I can give you is to go to bed before midnight and try your best to keep the same schedule every day.\n\nSo let\u2019s quickly recap today.\n\nIf you want to build more muscle, get leaner, and live a longer and healthier life, you MUST improve your insulin sensitivity.\n\nBuild more muscle, frequently\n\nTake Blood Sugar Optimizer and Fish Oil, 3x daily with your meals.\n\nTake a fiber supplement, 2x daily.\n\nSleep better \u2013 get to bed before midnight and keep the same sleep schedule daily.\n\nI\u2019ve put all the links to everything I mentioned today. So please go over them, take action, and support healthy blood sugar and insulin levels \u2026 you\u2019ll look and feel so much better!\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/warning-does-microwaving-food-give-you-cancer-or-radiation/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I know many people use the microwave these days, so today I\u2019m going to discuss:\n\nif it can cause cancer,\n\nwhat the government says,\n\nwhat clinical studies have shown\n\nand my own personal view on this topic.\n\nAnd I bring this up because I have a friend who has parents who are still alive in their late 80s, they\u2019re both healthy and have no cancer or any other real health problems.\n\nMy friend said that she believes that it\u2019s because her parents have never used the microwave. She said, \u201cI think microwaving food causes radiation and can cause cancer. I think this is one reason cancer is on the rise. We heat all of our foods on the stove, on an open fire as people have for thousands of years.\u201d\n\nDo you think she\u2019s right?\n\nThat microwaving food is bad for our health? That it can cause radiation to the foods we eat and thus, cause cancer?\n\nThe Story About Microwave\n\nBefore I dig deeper into this topic, I have a related story.\n\nA few years ago, I remember a story that went viral about how two plants were given water.\n\nOne was with regular purified water and the other was with microwaved water.\n\nWell, after 9 days, the plant that was given microwaved water was almost dead, while the one with purified water was still alive and healthy\n\nI remember after that, I stopped microwaving water for a while. I thought, \u201cWow, if it\u2019s killing a plant that quickly, who knows what it\u2019s doing to me\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019ll get back to this plant example in a minute.\n\nDoes Microwave Food Cause Radiation?\n\nBut, let\u2019s go back to the original topic \u2013 does microwave food cause radiation to the food and thus, potentially give you cancer?\n\nWell, the FDA says \u201cNo, microwave ovens do not cause radiation to the foods we eat\u201d.\n\nOkay, so that\u2019s good. Granted, many people don\u2019t trust the FDA or government these days when it comes to our health.\n\nSo, let\u2019s continue with the research.\n\nWhat does the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency\u201d say?\n\nMicrowave ovens use electromagnetic radiation to heat food. The non-ionizing radiation used by a microwave does not make the food radioactive. Microwaves are only produced when the oven is operating. The microwaves produced inside the oven are absorbed by food and produce the heat that cooks the food. Microwave ovens are constructed to ensure the electromagnetic radiation does not leave the oven. This includes safety interlocks which ensure that the oven turns off anytime the door is opened.\n\nSo, they also agree with the FDA. However, they do say that:\n\nIf microwave ovens are used while broken or altered, it is possible for them to leak electromagnetic radiation. Microwave radiation leaks are hard to detect because you can\u2019t smell or see microwaves. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates radiation-emitting products such as microwave ovens, advises against standing directly in front of or up against the oven while it is operating. This will avoid harm from any possible leaks.\n\nNow, this last part is important, so let me repeat it. Because we can\u2019t see or smell radiation leaks, it\u2019s advised that just in case something is broken or isn\u2019t operating correctly in the microwave, it\u2019s best that we avoid \u201cstanding directly in front of or up against the oven while it is operating\u201d\n\nOkay, so this is something I need to do and be cognizant of. We can use the microwave, but just to play it safe, walk away from it while it\u2019s operating.\n\nHow far?\u2026 I don\u2019t know. The farther the better I guess.\n\nClinical Studies About Microwave and Cancer\n\nBut, again, these are government agencies. What about clinical studies having to do with cancer?\n\nIn 1997, Peter Valberg reviewed all of the epidemiological studies at the time, which looked at the incidence and distribution of cancer in relation to microwave radiation exposure and tried to determine whether microwaves increased the risk of cancer in humans.\n\nHe found very little evidence to support this and concluded that microwaves do not cause cancer.\n\nThis makes sense if you understand how microwaves work because we know that the non-ionizing radiation used in microwave ovens is not powerful enough to transfer radiation into food; it can only cause the water molecules to move and thus, HEAT the food.\n\nAdditionally, another study printed in Molecular and Cellular Biology found that microwave radiation exposure did not show any signs of increased cancer risk in mice.\n\nTo summarize, microwaves don\u2019t make foods radioactive. They just heat them! This is done because Microwaves heat food by causing water molecules to vibrate and, as a result, food is heated.\n\nThis is different from conventional cooking which cooks the food from the absorption of heat energy.\n\nOne thing to remember is that radiation can damage the DNA. However, when it comes to food, it\u2019s already dead. No DNA damage. And, your body isn\u2019t affected by the DNA of what you eat.\n\nBack To Plant Experiment\n\nNow, going back to the microwaved water and plant experiment I mentioned earlier. Well, as it turned out, it wasn\u2019t accurate.\n\nNobody has been able to replicate that.\n\nIn fact, others have tried to replicate that experiment using 3 different types of water on 3 different types of plants using:\n\nBoiled water on a gas stove\n\nBoiled water in a microwave\n\nRegular, none boiled, or heated water\n\nThe end result is the plants were the same at the end. Nothing bad happened. No difference.\n\nMy View & Suggestions\n\nSo at the end of all of this, here are my thoughts:\n\nI don\u2019t think microwaving foods is bad for you or can cause cancer.\n\nI do think it\u2019s a good idea to stay away from the microwave while it\u2019s on, just to be extra cautious and safe.\n\nI also think that food tastes better when it\u2019s NOT microwaved and heated conventionally.\n\nHowever, I know microwaving is easy and fast. Make sure you use a microwave-safe container, preferably glass or even paper, both being better than plastic for a variety of reasons.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/do-artificial-sweeteners-cause-cancer-new-study/",
    "content": "A lot of people consume artificial sweeteners. Such as diet drinks and soda, or what they put in their coffee or tea\u2026 In addition to many health foods such as protein powders, bars and so forth contain artificial sweeteners.\n\nNow, some experts say that artificial sweeteners are horrible for you\u2026 They\u2019re bad for your brain, heart, gut, mood, and so much more.\n\nOther experts say they are totally fine and if there were problems, millions of people would be dying left and right.\n\nFor example, one very common and popular artificial sweetener is aspartame. The brand or popular name it is Nutrasweet\u00ae and Equal\u00ae.\n\nThe interesting part is that aspartame is simply made of the two naturally occurring amino acids, phenylalanine, and aspartic acid \u2013 which are the building blocks of protein.\n\nThe only \u201cunnatural\u201d part is that the phenylalanine in aspartame has been slightly modified by adding a methyl group, which gives aspartame its sweet taste.\n\nRecent Study About Artificial Sweeteners\n\nNow, there\u2019s a recent study about artificial sweeteners spanning 30 years, from 1988-2018.\n\nIt focused on 2 sweeteners, aspartame, and saccharin consumption. By the way, saccharin does have health problems and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not around anymore.\n\nTo make a long story short, the research found that there was no association between a higher intake of low-calorie sweeteners and overall cancer mortality risk.\n\nSo, does this mean you should start overdosing on artificial sweeteners?\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\n\nDoes it mean they are as bad as some people have stated, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nFor example, I think diet soda is much healthier than regular, sugar soda.\n\nAre Artificial Sweeteners Really Linked To Health Problems?\n\nNow, what about other studies or experts saying how artificial sweeteners are linked to so many health problems?\n\nWell, studies need to be dealt with at a much deeper level.\n\nFor example, how many of these studies were double-blind, HUMAN randomized clinical studies showing the negative effects of artificial sweeteners?\u2026 There are barely any.\n\nAdditionally, many times, the people who are out of shape, overweight, and/or trying to lose weight are the ones consuming all of these diet products and artificial sweeteners. Thus, the problem may not be the artificial sweeteners, but the person who is consuming them is unhealthy, to begin with.\n\nThe other problem may be that foods that contain artificial sweeteners, also contain lots of other artificial ingredients. They have typically processed foods.\n\nAnyway, the bottom line is that I don\u2019t think artificial sweeteners are nearly as bad as some so-called experts say they are.\n\nAnd based on this new 30-year study, there is no link between artificial sweeteners and cancer.\n\nSo, do what you want with this information.\n\nMy suggestion is to always be as natural as possible. However, if you want to consume a little bit of artificial sweeteners from time to time, go ahead.\n\nYou can even select more natural sweeteners such as Stevia, which I also use.\n\nIn all honesty, there are a lot of other and bigger problems to worry about.\n\nDo your best to live a natural, positive, and productive life!",

However, there are other factors here:\n\nThey eat a LOT of calories, between 8000 \u2013 20,000 daily. When you eat that much food, you\u2019re going to get fat. Except the Sumo style speeds up the process.\n\nThey eat primarily carbs.\n\nGenetics \u2013 wrestling scouts look for boys who are athletic (preferably with experience in the martial arts) and stocky in build, with bodies that are big-boned and capable of putting on weight easily.\n\nIntermittent Fasting & Weight Loss\n\nSo, what are the lessons we can take to an Intermittent Fasting plan if your goal is fat loss and you are not a Sumo wrestler in training?\n\nEating only 1 or 2 large meals isn\u2019t a good idea, several smaller ones are ideal for better absorption and hormones.\n\nDon\u2019t have high carbs \u2013 eat protein and fat. I like \u2153 (33%) of each as a starting point.\n\nTotal calories still count.\n\nDoing hours of exercises fasted is going to raise your cortisol, lower testosterone, burn muscle and hold on to fat. Keep your workouts between 45-60 min.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/the-real-truth-about-protein-powders-and-kidney-damage/",
    "content": "In a previous article about \u201cHow To Use Whey Protein for Maximum Muscle Gain & Fat Loss\u201d, someone asked if eating protein powder can cause kidney damage.\n\nWell, I have a very interesting and true story about this and how my old business partner died of kidney failure and I\u2019ll share it with you in just a minute.\n\nLastly, I\u2019ll also reveal the REAL cause of kidney damage, so continue reading.\n\nClinical Studies About Protein & Kidney Damage\n\nLet\u2019s first get the clinical studies out of the way.\n\nEating a high-protein meal can raise the pressure inside the kidneys and cause them to filter more blood than usual.1,2 Thus, putting more stress on the kidneys.\n\nAdditionally, there is no clinical evidence that too much protein can damage the kidneys of healthy people. 3,4 Granted, the studies are only for a few months and the protein intake isn\u2019t super high.\n\nHowever, there is evidence that a high-protein diet can be harmful to people with kidney disease or kidney problems.5,6\n\nSo, as far as the clinical studies are concerned, you can eat as much protein as you\u2019d like unless you have kidney disease.\n\nGranted, clinical studies are nothing like the REAL world.\n\nMy Partner Died Of Kidney Failure\n\nAround 2003, I had a very successful nutritional supplement business specific for athletes and bodybuilders. I had a business partner who was much older than me and at the time, someone I *thought* was also wiser and more knowledgeable.\n\nI really looked up to him at the beginning of our partnership and friendship.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, the longer I got to know him, the less I respected his decisions and views on health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nOne of them was the use of high-protein diets.\n\nI remember him telling me that in order to really increase my muscle mass, while minimizing fat gain, I need to eat a lot more protein. He suggested a minimum of at least 2 grams per pound of body weight and it would be much better if I had 3 grams.\n\nAt that time, I was eating 1 gram per pound. Thus, I weighed about 200 lbs (91 kgs) and ate 200 grams of protein.\n\nBut he suggested I increase it to 400 grams and preferably 600 grams, daily to start seeing the real muscle-building benefits.\n\nHe himself, being very muscular and lean at 250 lbs, was eating almost 1000 grams of protein daily and said that was ONE of his \u201csecrets\u201d. Most of the protein is from fast-digesting Whey protein.\n\nAnd so, I decided to give it a try because I trusted him.\n\nAfter all, he was 7 inches shorter than me and yet, he had an extra 50+ lbs of muscle.\n\nOver the next 3 months, I slowly increased my protein to eventually eating 600 grams daily. It was about 100 grams, 6x daily.\n\nAnd because that\u2019s just a lot of chewing, most of it was in fast-digesting whey protein.\n\nThe end result was I felt like crap. My pee was a dark color. I was always slow and sluggish. I didn\u2019t gain any extra muscle and thus, I ended this experiment after 3 months.\n\nSo, why am I telling you this story, since the subject of today\u2019s topic is \u201cprotein powder and kidney damage\u201d?\u2026\n\nWell, this is because my old business partner died a few years later due to kidney failure. He, in fact, was on kidney dialysis for a few years before I guess things finally gave out.\n\nWas this all because of the high-protein diet?\u2026\n\nNo \u2013 I don\u2019t think so.\n\nI\u2019m sure he was doing other things that were not good. He ended up being a liar anyway and that\u2019s why I stopped working with him.\n\nSo who knows what else he was doing that could have caused his kidney damage and eventual failure.\n\nBUT, I do think the high protein intake most definitely accelerated the process and added to the stress.\n\nAnd over the years, I\u2019ve known people having very high-protein diets \u2013 whole foods and powders \u2013 who do have elevated kidney numbers and liver enzymes.\n\nSo the bottom line is that people who have a lot of protein powders, also consume much higher amounts of protein since it\u2019s easier to drink 50 grams of protein than to eat.\n\nAnd YES, I do believe it can cause undue stress on your kidneys and eventually, cause damage.\n\nI suggest you eat NO more than 1 gram of protein, per pound of body weight, and that can be a mix of whole food and powders \u2013 including even some good vegetable protein sources.\n\nI also suggest cycling your protein intake and I\u2019ve made an article about this, \u201cEat NO Protein To Gain MORE Muscle\u201d.\n\nThe REAL Cause of Kidney Damage\n\nThe truth is that a much bigger cause of kidney damage is NOT protein, but blood pressure.\n\nWhich, unfortunately, many people have and they don\u2019t even know it.\n\nAnd the older you are, the higher your blood pressure is due to the negative changes in your hormones because of aging.\n\nAlso, anyone who doesn\u2019t sleep well is under daily stress and also takes stimulants -including caffeine \u2013 typically has blood pressure problems through various parts of the day.\n\nHeck, even I\u2019ve had mild blood pressure problems in the past 3-4 years and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been taking Blood Pressure Optimizer for a few years to keep my blood pressure in the normal, healthy range.\n\nWithin a month, my energy levels improved, as did my sleep and of course, my blood pressure and also kidney function, when I\u2019ve done a blood test.\n\nSo, if you have blood pressure problems or are concerned about kidney function, monitor your blood pressure daily and use natural herbs and vitamins.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123919342000138 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3602135/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262767/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK224634/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12639078 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15073493?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123919342000138\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3602135/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262767/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK224634/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12639078\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15073493?dopt=Abstract",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/everything-you-want-need-to-know-about-protein-powders/",
    "content": "I get a ton of questions about protein powders. And rightly so because there\u2019s so much confusion about it. Lots of misinformation. And of course, this is because there are so many protein powders and types, which only adds to the frustration.\n\nSo, today I\u2019m going to reveal everything you want and NEED to know about Protein Powders:\n\nHow much total protein you need during the day and with each meal\n\nWhat\u2019s the best and worst proteins for building muscle and losing fat\n\nWhat\u2019s the best protein for health and longevity\n\nI\u2019ll also discuss vegetarian/vegan protein sources\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what I use personally\n\nAnd best of all, how you can make your own customized protein powder, with any kind of protein you want, flavor, taste, and various ingredients you can add to it (see the bottom of this page with video instructions).\n\nAnd the coolest part of it all \u2013 this will cost you LESS money than buying any of the popular protein powders you see online or in the stores. In fact, this is how I have been getting my own protein powders for a decade now \u2013 you\u2019ll get my contacts, discounts, and custom formula.\n\nAnd this is the first time I\u2019m making this information public, so please pay attention.\n\nAnd I\u2019m putting in all this time and effort for you because I\u2019m just like you \u2013 I used to be totally confused about protein.\n\nIn fact, in the old days, I used to buy some \u201ccrash weight gain\u201d powder by Weider with Arnold on the product.\n\nIt was junk, but that\u2019s all we had then.\n\nLater I would buy these big tubs of protein \u2013 it was called something like \u201cMega Weight Gainer\u201d or \u201cMega Mass\u201d or something like that. It was by Weider again.\n\nAnyway, it tasted good and it had a lot of calories, which I needed because I was really skinny. But, it was cheap protein \u2013 mainly milk and sugar. Sadly, I was gassy and bloated all the time because it was made with junky milk protein and ingredients.\n\nThen, everything changed when I met Jeff Everson and Dr. Scott Connely, who helped create Met-Rx. It originally came in 2 bottles \u2013 Base and Plus. Later it came in single, convenient packets.\n\nMet-Rx changed everything. It contained much better protein, lower carbs, and low calories. Very little gas or bloat.\n\nLater, similar \u201cMeal Replacement Powders\u201d or \u201cReady To Drink\u201d (RTD) solutions came along, such as EAS MyoPlex.\n\nHowever, the next big change came when pure Whey protein powder was released and one of the most popular was promoted by one of my mentors, Dan Duchaine called Designer Whey.\n\nWhen pure, whey powder was released \u2013 it was the \u201cbest\u201d protein you could buy and at that time, it really was. And it\u2019s still one of the most popular protein these days.\n\nToday\u2019s Protein Powders\n\nNow, these days there are a lot more advanced and better proteins. And one of the biggest changes is vegan, no-dairy proteins which are almost as good and digestible as whey protein.\n\nThis is great because you no longer have to worry about \u201closing muscle\u201d if you don\u2019t have animal protein. Plus, in all honesty \u2013 having more vegan/veggie protein is actually better for your health and longevity.\n\nNow, I\u2019m sharing all of this history with you to let you know that I\u2019ve been at this for a LONG time, so \u201cI\u2019ve been there, done that\u201d and I want you to learn from my mistakes.\n\nSo, with that said \u2013 let\u2019s start with the top QA\u2019s.\n\nHow Much Protein Do You Really Need?\n\nPeople selling you protein powders are always pushing you to eat more protein, but you don\u2019t need to. I\u2019ve tried as little as 0.5 grams per pound of body weight (about 100 grams/400 calories) to as high as 3 grams per pound of body weight (600 grams/2400 calories).\n\nMore will NOT build any extra muscle \u2013 especially in the long-run and if anything, it\u2019ll increase muscle breakdown (which I\u2019ve done an article about as well).\n\nPlus, it\u2019s just very unhealthy to have so much protein.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve found is the most amount of protein you really need is about 1 gram per pound of bodyweight. I weigh about 200 lbs and I eat about 200 grams (800 calories). Even if you\u2019re taking steroids and working out really hard \u2013 you do NOT need more protein.\n\nI\u2019d rather you ate more fat and carbs.\n\nHow Much Protein Per Meal?\n\nI\u2019ve read all the studies and listened to all the experts about this.\n\nThere are studies showing that your body can only absorb about 10 grams per hour, depending on the type of protein (whey being the best).\n\nAnother study shows only 20 grams per meal is required for maximum protein synthesis. Eating more didn\u2019t increase protein synthesis.\n\nAnd in another study, it showed eating all the protein in ONE meal, instead of 4, made no difference. Granted, these were women who only ate 50 grams of protein daily.\n\nAnd in an Intermittent Fasting study, eating all of the protein during a 4 hour time window and then fasting 20 hours didn\u2019t cause muscle loss. However, it also didn\u2019t cause muscle gains (protein synthesis) either.\n\nNow, there are lots of factors here \u2013 age, the type of protein, your hormone profile (being the most important), and what you\u2019re eating the protein with (fats, carbs, fiber, etc.) all make a difference.\n\nHowever, let me keep it simple for you. Try to eat between 25-40 grams of protein, per meal, spread out evenly throughout the day.\n\nThis is important because protein is the only macronutrient that can\u2019t be stored. Carbs get stored in the muscle and liver. Fat gets stored in fat cells. But, protein needs to be replenished throughout the day.\n\nSo for me, eating 200 grams, I\u2019ll spread that over 5-7 meals, which comes out to about 25-40 grams per meal.\n\nAnd I do this because I feel better. I don\u2019t get bloated eating a massive meal of protein. It also keeps my stomach flatter, then having all of this food in only 2-3 big meals.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Worst Protein For Building Muscle & Losing Fat?\n\nIf I had to pick one protein source you should avoid, it\u2019s SOY. Unfortunately, it\u2019s in everything because it\u2019s cheap and it\u2019s been Genetically Modified (GMO).\n\nHowever, the reason I don\u2019t like it is that it increases estrogen levels, which then causes a decrease in testosterone.\n\nSo, there\u2019s your muscle loss.\n\nAdditionally, soy decreases thyroid production, especially the primary hormone \u2013 T3, which controls your metabolism.\n\nSo, there\u2019s your fat gaining.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Protein For Gaining Muscle & Losing Fat?\n\nIf I had to pick one, it comes down to Whey protein. However, not any kind of Whey because I believe most of them aren\u2019t good. I think the best is Whey Isolate and more specifically, cold-filtration, grass-fed Whey Isolate.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you where to get this special blend at the end of this article.\n\nThe benefits of Whey Isolate is that:\n\nIt has the highest Branched Chain Amino Acids (3 most abundant amino in the muscle).\n\nIt boosts your immune system.\n\nThere\u2019s almost no lactose or sugar, so there\u2019s very little stomach discomfort.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to digest and fast absorbable.\n\nIt has the highest Biological Value (absorbable protein) at 104, whole eggs being 100.\n\nNow, there\u2019s also Whey Protein Concentrate \u2013 which is cheap, has lactose, and causes stomach problems. Unfortunately, this is typically added into protein powders and protein bars, because it is cheap and it gives the ILLUSION that you\u2019re getting a lot more Whey. Don\u2019t buy it and stay away from it.\n\nAnother source of \u201cmilk\u201d protein is Micellar Casein \u2013 this is slower digesting protein. It\u2019s something you\u2019d use before bed. But not before or after a workout. It doesn\u2019t have the same immune-boosting benefits, nor as high a concentration of BCAA as Whey Isolate.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s Hydrolyzed Caseinate \u2013 which is also milk, it\u2019s faster and easier to digest than Micellar Casein. But it also costs 3x the price of it and the Whey Isolate. It\u2019s NOT worth the extra cost. It also doesn\u2019t have the same benefits of Whey Isolate (BCAA, immune function, etc.). It\u2019s just expensive to manufacture, but no extra benefits.\n\nAnd like I said, later I\u2019ll show you exactly where and how to get the best Whey Isolate and if you wanted to blend in other proteins, you can as well.\n\nWhat About Vegetarian/Vegan Protein Powders?\n\nAs you may know from watching my previous articles, I\u2019m NOT a fan of dairy. Certainly NOT milk. I think milk is for babies and COW milk is for baby COWS.\n\nSo, the most I\u2019d suggest is 25 grams of Whey Isolate, once daily. During or after your workout.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there are a lot of great vegetable protein powders that have almost the same benefits, digestibility and absorbability of Whey Isolate, but without having to eat dairy.\n\nThere\u2019s Pea Protein \u2013 which is in a lot of vegetarian powders and bars. I\u2019m not a fan of it because it causes inflammation and it\u2019s hard to mix. Good for a bar, but not a drink.\n\nThere\u2019s Hemp Protein \u2013 which is great, but it\u2019s hard to have it as the primary source. It\u2019s just hard to mix and it tastes like grass and dirt.\n\nThen we have Alfalfa Protein \u2013 Similar to Hemp, it\u2019s a \u201cgreen\u201d powder, which is good for alkalizing your body. However, just like Hemp, it\u2019s not good by itself. Better to mix it with other protein types.\n\nFinally, we have my favorite \u2013 Rice Protein (non-GMO). There\u2019s no sugar, easy to digest and here\u2019s the best part: in a 2013 Nutrition Journal study, it showed that rice protein is just as effective as whey protein in gaining muscle, losing fat, and improving exercise performance!\n\nLater I\u2019ll show you ways that you can blend these vegetable proteins for all the benefits, but still have it taste good. But if you had to pick one veggie source \u2013 I\u2019d go with the non-GMO Rice Protein.\n\nWhat About Other Types Of Protein Powders\n\nThere are other types of proteins \u2013 other than dairy and vegetables.\n\nThere\u2019s EGG protein powder, white only or whole eggs. I don\u2019t like only egg white, because you\u2019re missing half the amino that are found in the yolks. And, I\u2019d much rather you ate whole, fresh, pasture-raised eggs. They have a lot more health benefits.\n\nThere\u2019s also Collagen Protein, which has become popular over the past 5-10 years. I think there are benefits for skin, hair, and joints \u2013 which is always nice. But, nothing for building muscle and losing fat\u2026 if that\u2019s your primary goal.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s Bone Broth protein \u2013 which has recently become very popular. Similar to Collagen protein, it has many benefits for skin, hair, and especially the joints. All important. But, nothing for gaining muscle, and fat loss.\n\nGo ahead and use Collagen and Bone Broth protein to increase your total protein calories during the day, with the added health benefits for your skin, hair, joints, and gut.\n\nSo there you have it. I think I\u2019ve covered all the main protein powders. I know there are others \u2013 such as insect protein powders and so forth. But, I\u2019ll save the rare ones for another article.\n\nAs a quick summary \u2013 I think the best protein powder is grass-fed, cold-filtration, Whey Isolate.\n\nThe best veggie protein is non-GMO Rice Protein.\n\nFeel free to add in some collagen and/or bone broth protein for skin, hair, and joint health.\n\nHow To Make Your Own Customized Protein Powder & Save MONEY At The Same Time\n\nPlease watch the below video instructions about how you can make your own protein powder, customized with any % ratio of protein powder you want, flavor and other additives (BCAA, creatine, glutamine, etc).\n\nThis is how I make my own protein powder for myself.\n\nNOTE: They\u2019ve recently made changes to their website, but you\u2019ll get the idea.\n\nHere is the direct link to their website.\n\nDuring the checkout, use the coupon code DrSam.\n\nI\u2019m not here to sell you anything.

However, I suggest you avoid kale and that\u2019s in my other article, \u201cvegetables you must avoid.\u201d\n\nCruciferous vegetables are amazing, such as broccoli and brussels sprouts. High in Vitamin K and C, as well as protein. Both should be steamed or lightly cooked.\n\nAsparagus \u2013 also high in Vit K and protein. It acts as a mild diuretic as well, which is good for high blood pressure.\n\nBeet Greens, also high in protein.\n\nGarlic and onions \u2013 have lots of positive effects on your health. However, be mindful of your breath.\n\nCelery \u2013 great for blood pressure and circulation and has almost no calories.\n\nMushrooms have many medicinal benefits. White button mushrooms are one of the best for improving hormones. Reishi mushrooms are also very good for your immune system. Shitake helps fight tumors.\n\nHowever, IF you have yeast or candida, I think you should avoid mushrooms until you get that handled, due to the fact that mushrooms are a fungus. I discuss this in further detail in my \u201cvegetables you should avoid\u201d article.\n\nOkra \u2013 have tons of benefits and I made an entire article about this.\n\nArtichokes \u2013 have lots of protein and antioxidants. However, make sure they are cooked fully, steam it for about 30 min on a stove-top.\n\nBok Choy is also very good, make sure it\u2019s steamed or lightly cooked.\n\nCabbage is great, especially as sauerkraut because it has millions of probiotics, which is great for your gut health.\n\nSeaweed and sea vegetables are great. The healthiest and longest living people eat foods from the sea.\n\nPotatoes \u2013 they are one of the best vegetables and a safe source of carbohydrates. Specifically, yams and sweet potatoes are the best. Cook them and then let them cool in the fridge for about 8 hours and then reheat them and eat them. This will increase the resistant starches, which means it\u2019s better for your gut, less elevated blood sugar levels and best of all, it has fewer calories.\n\nI also made an article about this with rice \u2013 if you want to eat more rice and not get fat.\n\nOther types of potatoes should be avoided and I mention them in my \u201cWorst Vegetables You Must Avoid\u201d article.",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019ve been using apple cider vinegar for over a decade now because of the various health benefits.\n\nAnd today I\u2019m going to quickly reveal 5 surprising and scientifically proven benefits of apple cider vinegar. And I\u2019ll end with the correct dose and type, for maximum health benefits. And also what to avoid.\n\nKills Harmful Bacteria\n\nWhen I was a kid, I remember seeing my grandmother wash the toilet and sink and other things around the house, using a homemade mixture of vinegar and water. I remember asking her, \u201cWhy not just use one of those commercial products?\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cThis is safer, it\u2019s natural, it\u2019s not toxic, and it kills germs and bacteria\u201d.\n\nThis is true because vinegar can help kill pathogens, which is bacteria, viruses, and other organisms that can cause disease.1\n\nIn fact, Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, used vinegar for wound cleaning over two thousand years ago.\n\nHelps Support Healthy Blood Sugar Levels\n\nI think one of the most well-known and popular uses of Vinegar is the fact it can help support healthy blood sugar levels. And as I\u2019ve stated in previous articles, high blood sugar is a common denominator of health problems\n\nStudies have shown that vinegar can\n\nImprove insulin sensitivity during a high-carb meal by 19\u201334%.2\n\nReduce blood sugar by 34% after eating 50 grams of white bread.3\n\nNumerous other studies in humans show that vinegar can improve insulin function and blood sugar levels after meals.4,5\n\nSo if you\u2019re concerned about your blood sugar, start using some vinegar in your diet.\n\nHelps You Lose Weight & Shrinks Belly Fat\n\nVinegar has also been shown to help you lose weight and shrink that stubborn belly fat.\n\nIt does so through 2 primary ways\n\nIncreases satiety and thus, makes you feel fuller and less hungry.\n\nLowering of the blood sugar. High insulin levels stores body fat.\n\nDon\u2019t expect miracles. Studies show weight loss is about 2-3 pounds after 3 months, but that\u2019s still a good start, and its progress \u2013 which is always great.6\n\nIt May Help Avoid Getting Tumors\n\nTo my surprise, there are numerous studies showing that various types of vinegar can kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.7-9\n\nUnfortunately, these studies were done on rats and not on humans. But, hey\u2026 it\u2019s still very positive, right?\n\nSupports Healthy Cholesterol & Heart Health\n\nDid you know that heart disease is the world\u2019s number one killer and a common cause of premature death?10\n\nStudies have shown that apple cider vinegar can help support healthy cholesterol and fatty triglyceride levels. Plus, it even helps support healthy blood pressure. And let\u2019s not forget the support of healthy blood sugar levels \u2013 another common risk factor for heart problems.\n\nAgain \u2013 these studies were done on animals and not humans.\n\nHowever, if you do want proven solutions for supporting healthy cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure levels, and so forth, based on the usage of real humans, make sure you visit the articles that I will link below.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s talk about the best type of Vinegar and the dosage.\n\nI use Bragg\u2019s Organic Apple Cider Vinegar and I get the one that says, With The \u201cMother\u201d on it\u2026. Which are strands of proteins, enzymes and friendly bacteria that give the product a murky appearance.\n\nSome people believe that the \u201cmother\u201d is responsible for most of the health benefits, although there are currently no studies to support this.\n\nI take 1 tablespoon, 3x daily. For sure in the morning and at night and most of the time, mid-day.\n\nI also add a tablespoon of organic lemon juice in it as well for taste and also some additional and similar health benefits.\n\nI actually mix it all in a cup of water and drink it down, so it dilutes the taste.\n\nYou can do it on an empty stomach but for some people that cause discomfort so you can do it a few minutes before a meal.\n\nBTW, I don\u2019t like the pills. They aren\u2019t as beneficial and they cost much more. And I hate wasting money and getting an inferior product that\u2019s less effective.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar has many health benefits. Don\u2019t expect miracles, but it\u2019s inexpensive and easy to use.\n\nAs promised, here are the important links for more details on supporting healthy\n\nblood pressure levels\n\nand Bragg\u2019s apple cider vinegar.\n\nVisit the links above and let me know how these solutions work for you!\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788933/\n\nhttp://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/1/281.long\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7796781\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28292654\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27213723\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661687\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1541-4337.12228/full\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15630260\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15149153\n\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/aloe-vera-juice-the-5-best-benefits-important-warnings/",
    "content": "Over the past few months, I\u2019ve gotten at least a dozen questions about Aloe Vera juice and if it works, what are the benefits, and are there any negatives.\n\nSo, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll discuss today\u2026\n\nAloe vera juice is a gooey, thick liquid made from the flesh of the aloe vera plant leaf. Growing up, we used it to treat sunburns. You rarely heard about people drinking it. However, it does have additional health benefits outside of treating sunburns.\n\n5 Best Benefits Of Aloe Vera\n\nToday I\u2019m going to give you the 5 best benefits of drinking aloe vera juice, all backed by BOTH clinical studies and anecdotal, real-life feedback.\n\nBy the way, one of the great benefits of real, organic aloe vera juice is it doesn\u2019t have the typical sugar content of all other juices on the market \u2013 like fruit juice or even most vegetable juices.\n\nAn 8 oz, one cup of Aloe vera juice contains no sugar and only 4 grams of carbs, which is just 16 calories.\n\nBut you only need about 2 oz to get many of the benefits that I mention today.\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize that one of the major causes of disease and sickness is being too acidic. And thus, you should try to become more alkaline since our diets and stressful lifestyles \u2014 both physical and emotional \u2014 cause a very acidic environment in your body.\n\nAnd thus, the acidity increases your odds of getting sick, various diseases, and so forth.\n\nYes, I know there are some \u201cexperts\u201d who say this is impossible and your body naturally will alkalize itself, and balance your PH, etc., etc. Yes, it will and after years of doing this, it will eventually breakdown and get sick.\n\nI feel very strongly about this and I\u2019ll just leave it here.\n\nNeedless to say, you should alkalize your body with Aloe Vera juice and other alkaline foods such as:\n\n2 \u2013 Heartburn & Acid Reflux\n\nThe compounds in aloe vera juice help control the secretion of acid in your stomach. The effects have even been shown to combat gastric ulcers and keep them from getting larger. It\u2019s also beneficial for those who have acid reflux.\n\nAnd one of the big reasons for all of this is also because of the alkalinity effects I mentioned earlier.\n\nMost people don\u2019t drink enough water and are walking around dehydrated. They fill themselves up with coffee, soda, and other drinks \u2013 all of which have NONE of the benefits of water and they do NOT hydrate the body.\n\nNext time, instead of Gatorade, Vitamin Water, or similar drinks \u2013 even coconut water \u2013 try some aloe vera juice because it\u2019s very hydrating.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t overdo it and I\u2019ll share with you why in a minute.\n\n4 \u2013 Digestive Benefits\n\nAloe vera has digestive benefits because it contains several enzymes known to help in the breakdown of sugars and fats and to keep your digestion running smoothly.\n\nAdditionally, the juice may also help people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other inflammatory disorders of the intestines.\n\n5 \u2013 Supporting Healthy Blood Sugar\n\nIngesting two tablespoons of aloe vera juice per day can help support healthy blood sugar levels.. And yes, it even works in those with blood sugar regulation problems.\n\nA Negative Of Aloe Vera To Beware Of\n\nThere are very minor negatives with Aloe Vera juice, but one of the biggest is the fact that it\u2019s a natural laxative. Thus, helps you go to the bathroom, especially if constipated.\n\nSo, when you start taking it, start low.\n\nYou only need about 1-2 oz of aloe vera juice daily to start. Even just 1 tablespoon daily to start. Eventually, I worked up to 2x daily. You do NOT want to exceed 8 oz, which is one cup.\n\nSpread it out throughout the day.\n\nWhen shopping for Aloe Vera Juice, make sure to look for the following statements on the label:\n\nI\u2019ve listed popular aloe vera juices you can purchase at Amazon.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3872617/\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23195077\n\nniehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/aloe/index.cfm\n\nnccih.nih.gov/health/aloevera\n\nmed.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=38208\n\njournals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9198816&fileId=S0248129414000012n\n\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795515\n\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11268118\n\nhindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/376123/\n\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23195077",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/chia-seeds-pros-cons-benefits-warnings/",
    "content": "Today I want to discuss Chia seeds. It\u2019s one of those \u201chealth foods\u201d that is misunderstood. Chia seeds are tiny black seeds from the plant Salvia hispanica, which is related to mint.\n\nChia seeds were an important food for the Aztecs and Mayans for thousands of years. They utilized them for their ability to provide sustainable energy.\n\nIn fact, \u201cchia\u201d is the ancient Mayan word for \u201cstrength\u201d.\n\nIn recent modern days, the Chia Seeds are considered by many to be a \u201csuperfood\u201d. Some people even call them one of the healthiest foods on the planet.\n\nAnd if you take a look at the benefits, you can see why.\n\nBenefits & Pros of Chia Seeds\n\nThey\u2019re very high in fiber, which is good for a healthy colon and they can keep you full for longer periods of time. This also helps with weight loss.\n\nThey are high in calcium, magnesium, and boron, which are important for strong bones.\n\nWhen mixed with water, they form a gel that aids in digestion.\n\nThey\u2019re high in important omega 3 fats\u2026 which I\u2019ll discuss in further detail in a minute because it can actually be a negative aspect of this benefit, specifically for chia seeds.\n\nIt\u2019s well balanced in the macronutrients because it contains a good ratio of fats, carbs, and proteins.\n\nIt\u2019s also good if you\u2019re worried about blood sugar. It has a low glycemic index and load and it also contains no sugar.\n\nSo all in all, you can see why it really is very healthy.\n\nCons & Warnings of Chia Seeds\n\nSo, let\u2019s discuss some of the potential \u201ccons\u201d and I\u2019ll end with an important warning.\n\nSome people are allergic to chia seeds. Sometimes it\u2019s subtle and other times it\u2019s very evident. And I\u2019ll tell you why this happens in a minute. But pay attention to symptoms and signs such as rashes, hives, and watery eyes. There are also those common ones that are usually related to foods in general, such as trouble in breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, and swelling of the tongue.\n\nAnother problem is stomach and gastrointestinal problems, such as gas, bloating, and constipation.\n\nSomething else that most people don\u2019t know is that Chia seeds can thin the blood and can also lower blood pressure, which can actually be a benefit if you suffer from poor circulation and blood pressure problems. But if you don\u2019t, it could cause you to pass out or become fatigued.\n\nAnd the biggest problem I\u2019ve realized is that despite the fact they are high in omega 3 fats, which are typically anti-inflammatory, the Chia seeds actually INCREASE inflammatory markers and this is because of 2 reasons.\n\nOmega 3 fats are best consumed from fish sources \u2013 food or oil. But vegetarian sources such as seeds, like Flax or Chia, typically only contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).\n\nALA is not as active in the body and must be converted to two other forms of omega-3 fatty acids \u2014 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) \u2014 to have the same health benefits as fish omega 3s.\n\nUnfortunately, your body\u2019s ability to convert ALA is limited. Only about 5% of ALA is converted to EPA, while less than 0.5% is converted to DHA. And the older we get, the worse the conversions.\n\nThus, just because it\u2019s \u201chigh\u201d in omega 3 fats, does NOT mean your body converts and utilizes it. However, if you don\u2019t want to have any fish products, then these vegetarian sources are all you\u2019ve got \u2013 but you\u2019ll need a higher dosage to get the same benefits as fish oils.\n\n2 \u2013 Higher In Lectins\n\nThe second reason for the inflammation is that they are higher in lectins.\n\nAnd lectins cause inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome, decrease the immune system, exacerbate autoimmune conditions, and lots of other negative things.\n\nHowever, Chia seeds are not super high in lectins, it\u2019s more of a \u201cmedium-high\u201d food. So, if you want to eat them, don\u2019t go overboard, less is best. And it\u2019s best to soak them in water first for an hour or two.\n\nAs with everything, test small and see how you feel and look. Then, increase the amount or dosage and continue to monitor how you look and feel. If everything is good and you feel great, then keep doing it.\n\nIf not, then this or some other particular food doesn\u2019t work for your body type, genetics, and hormones. At least you know.\n\nThe hardest part is to pay attention to the minor changes in your body \u2014 good or bad. When you eat food, you should feel good, energized, and it should continue that way for many hours.\n\nSo, there you have it. Enjoy your chia seeds.\n\nWatch out for potential allergies and inflammation due to lectins.\n\nPay attention to how you look and feel. Test small and increase, as long as you feel good.",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss the shocking and real truth \u2013 and scam \u2013 about the carnivore diet.\n\nWhich, for anyone new to this term, is basically an all-animal, meat-based protein diet.\n\nIt\u2019s also a zero-carb diet, but not necessarily a ketogenic diet, and I\u2019ll discuss the differences in a few seconds.\n\nAnd I bring this up because of all the misinformation about the Carnivore diet and the fact a viewer asked me the following question:\n\nWhat do you think of a carnivore diet? I\u2019ve been doing it for about 2 weeks and I see a lot of improvements already. Is it safe for me to follow all the time? I hear amazing things about it.\n\nAs stated already, you only eat animal-based proteins. Thus, NO carbs, vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, starches, or added fats.\n\nThe main thing about this fad diet \u2013 yes, it\u2019s a fad that has come up again recently \u2013 is that you are not having any carbs at all.\n\nA ketogenic diet is similar as far as no carbs, but on the opposite side, you have very low proteins. A TRUE keto diet is basically all fat.\n\nWhile a Carnivore diet is all animal protein.\n\nBoth again, have no carbs.\n\nIs the Carnivore Diet Effective?\n\nHere\u2019s the truth \u2013 I don\u2019t like any diet that restricts a major macronutrient \u2013 such as carbs.\n\nI also do not like any diet that will restrict key micronutrients and all the amazing nutrients that are found in vegetables and even fruits. All the variety of colors that offer amazing phyto and poly nutrients, vitamins, and minerals are sourced because of and from the most powerful life force on the planet \u2013 the SUN!\n\nThe major benefits people feel and see from a carnivore diet is NOT because of the all-meat diet.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s from restricting and eliminating all of the junk that people normally eat \u2014 simple carbs, man-made and packaged foods, high insulinogenic diets, inflammatory foods, and so on and so forth.\n\nThus, the benefit of a carnivore diet is not from what you are eating, but more so from what you are NO longer eating.\n\nAnd trust me, being on a carnivore diet or any super restrictive diet \u2013 including a ketogenic diet \u2013 is NOT a long-term solution or maintainable lifestyle.\n\nAfter a few weeks or months, you\u2019ll be back to normal.\n\nVery rarely is someone following such diets, year after year \u2013 without having health issues and deficiencies.\n\nWhat Makes a Healthy Diet?\n\nA healthy diet consists of\n\nlots of vegetables and fibers\n\nhealthy fats \u2013 which is a MIXTURE of both saturated and unsaturated fats\n\nproteins from both animal and vegetable sources\n\nand yes, some healthy carbs, based around how much exercise you do \u2013 which EVERYONE must be exercising daily \u2014 both aerobic and anaerobic, cardio, and weights.\n\nThe basics are very simple, logical, and backed by lots of evidence.\n\nStop with the stupid fad diets \u2013 high in this or low in that. You shouldn\u2019t eliminate any macronutrients \u2013 just manage the amounts and ratios, based on your genetics, hormones, goals, lifestyle, and current health status.\n\nOf course, we can get into the details of such a diet and I have an entire article series about this, which you can start reading today.\n\nPlease listen carefully, extremes of any kind is not a healthy or viable long-term solution in any aspect of life \u2013 this includes a carnivore diet.",

Trust me, there\u2019s nothing new going on.\n\nBut today, I\u2019m going to focus on intermittent fasting and the increase in Growth Hormone.\n\nA subscriber asked me:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 what\u2019s the best way to do intermittent fasting to really increase my growth hormone levels? I\u2019ve heard that fasting is awesome for boosting GH. I want to increase muscle mass and really get super lean and ripped and I know GH is the secret.\u201d\n\nUmm\u2026 okay, first of all \u2013 there are NO \u201csecrets\u201d to losing weight.\n\nThere are better strategies based on YOUR body type, genetics, food preferences, lifestyle, goals, and so forth.\n\nBut trust me, NO secrets other than the fact that genetics aside, it\u2019s ALL about optimizing and balancing out key hormone levels that allow maximum fat burning, appetite suppression, and preserving muscle mass.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll talk about these hormones in a minute.\n\nA Study on Intermittent Fasting\n\nNow, in regards to GH and intermittent fasting \u2026 There\u2019s a study that many people who promote intermittent fasting, reference, which shows how fasting can increase your growth hormone levels by a massive 1,250%.1 This is really impressive, right?\n\nBut they leave out the part that the study involved people who fasted for over ONE WEEK!\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m not going to stop eating for an entire week, so I can brag about how much my GH levels shot up \u2026 while I\u2019m starving to death and all my muscle mass is dissolving.\n\nThe Truth About Intermittent Fasting and GH\n\nThe truth is that STRESS causes an increase in growth hormone. Thus, not eating, low blood sugar and physical stress will all increase GH.2-3\n\nHowever, this does not mean you\u2019re losing fat and gaining muscle.\n\nThis is very different than the GH released with a growing baby and teenagers, which is NOT stress-related. Or the growth hormone released with deep sleep.\n\nThese are all positive, non-stress-mediated growth hormone releases.\n\nJust know that there are many hormones involved and looking at ONLY the growth hormone during fasting is elementary and idiotic. Nobody takes into account other hormones during times of stress \u2013 such as an increase in stress hormones, a decrease in testosterone, an increase in insulin levels, and dozens of other hormonal imbalances.\n\nAdditionally, other intermittent fasting promoters who fast for 18+ hours daily say it\u2019s this increase in GH that\u2019s causing the fat loss.\n\nNO, IT\u2019S NOT people \u2013 it\u2019s the fact that most people who do intermittent fasting and not eating for 18+ hours are eating fewer total calories. This is the primary reason for weight loss.\n\nIt\u2019s also due to less insulin secretion and improved insulin sensitivity.\n\nBut trust me, the higher HGH levels are NOT the primary cause \u2013 not even close.\n\nI deal with lots of athletes and also older people that take high doses of exogenous GH daily and trust me, they are not burning fat like crazy and walking around at 5% body fat, eating anything they want.\n\nHow Long Should a Fast Be?\n\nAlso, if your goal is to build or preserve muscle and lose fat AND if you are exercising with weights \u2013 please don\u2019t fast for 18+ hours.\n\nThat\u2019s way too many hours to go without eating anything, especially protein.\n\nYour body can use stored glucose and fat from your body \u2013 but the only \u201cstored\u201d protein is from your MUSCLES, which need to be replenished often.\n\nIf you go too many hours without consuming some protein, your body will slowly catabolize and eat away your muscles for the amino acids to help repair the body.\n\nYou may not notice it right away, but over the next few months, you will most certainly start to lose muscle mass if you\u2019re not eating for 18 hours daily.\n\nThe MOST I tell people to fast is maybe 12 hours daily. That\u2019s it.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t go to the gym fast and lift weights \u2013 your performance will be poor and you\u2019ll again eat away at the muscle cells. Make sure you eat at least once before exercise.\n\nHow Can I Optimize Weight Loss?\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the optimal way to fast, while still building muscle and/or losing fat, I\u2019ll do an article about this.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to burn fat long-term and help preserve or even gain muscle at the same time, then your goal is to optimize specific hormones that control fat burning, such as\n\nIncreasing Adiponectin, Leptin, and Thyroid\n\nDecreasing Cortisol, Ghrelin, and Insulin\n\nAs you can see, GH is not on this list. Not because it doesn\u2019t work or it\u2019s not important, but because it\u2019s lower on the priority list.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve got two important links I want you to take a look at.\n\nThe first is a list of natural ingredients that help improve these 6 fat-burning hormones and a couple of other ones.\n\nThe second is a proven, 20-year formula that causes these hormones to be optimized together, at the same time for maximum fat burning.\n\nTake a look at both and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6758355\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/210540a0\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3114818",

    "content": "The more articles I do, the more comments and questions I get, the more frustrated I\u2019m getting due to all the misinformation, hype, and total BS.\n\nAnd this has to do with today\u2019s topic of how \u201cdark chocolate\u201d is healthy for you.\n\nEven people that I totally respect, such as Dr. Gundry, Dr. Mercola, and Dave Aspery are promoting this. And I don\u2019t mean to single out these guys \u2013 I mention them only because I\u2019ve learned a lot from them and they\u2019ve helped millions of people, far more than I have.\n\nAnd this all started a few months ago when I saw a dark chocolate bar on my mom\u2019s table. I asked her why she was having it, and she said, \u201cI heard that it\u2019s really healthy for you and you\u2019ll live longer because of it.\u201d\n\nWell, my mom is 80 years old and she\u2019s also a \u201cfoodie\u201d. She loves to eat and will find any reason to eat some kind of junk food IF she thinks it has some potential health benefits.\n\nWhat The So-Called \u201cExperts\u201d Are Saying\n\nIf you do a search about \u201cdark chocolate benefits\u201d, you\u2019ll see well over 60 million results.\n\nSome of the more popular people and guys I respect, such as Gundry1, Mercola2, and Aspery state that some of the benefits of dark chocolate3 are:\n\nContains polyphenols and flavonoids. Big deal, it\u2019s not that much. Fresh berries, good quality green tea or coffee, and supplements contain way more.\n\nGood for your heart and brain by improving cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood flow. This is done because it helps thin the blood.\n\nFish oil is FAR more powerful and has way more health benefits. Taking Blood Flow Optimizer has even more benefits because it also strengthens your arteries and veins, making them more pliable and flexible and thus, reducing your risk of a rupture that can cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\nImproves your mood because it helps produce dopamine and serotonin, which are called \u201cfeel-good hormones\u201d or more accurately, neurotransmitters. Again, this is totally lame. It\u2019s in tiny amounts.\n\nExercise, sunshine, touch, or even smiling does much more to improve these chemicals. So does taking natural herbs and amino acids found in ProVanax, which is backed by DECADES and hundreds of clinical studies \u2013 not just a few recent ones.\n\nDark Chocolate Clinical Studies\n\nSpeaking of clinical studies regarding dark chocolate and its benefits. Did you know there are over 100 studies about dark chocolate, as a \u201cmiracle-safe food\u201d?4\n\nDo you know who funded all of these 100+ studies?\u2026 Mars Inc, that\u2019s right \u2013 the company that makes Snickers, Twix and M&M\u2019s.\n\nYes, more clinical studies have hidden agendas \u2013 which is to make more money.\n\nI can dig a lot deeper into this topic, but I think you get the point.\n\nSo let\u2019s move on to the\u2026\n\nBest Type of Dark Chocolate\n\nNow, if you are going to have dark chocolate, the so-called \u201cexperts\u201d say you should have at least 72% Cacao and preferably, 90% to even 99% cacao, which by the way, tastes really bad.\n\nDr. Gundry says, \u201cmore bitter, more better\u201d.\n\nWhich means you do NOT want any Milk Chocolate in it or sugar. Unfortunately, over 95% of \u201cdark chocolate bars\u201d contain milk and sugar. So read the labels.\n\nOne of the highest dark chocolate % bars, which Dave Aspery also recommends is Excellence 99% Cocoa Bar by Lindt.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that a clinical study suggests the benefits of dark chocolate would be at about 50 grams daily for a minimum of 8 weeks.5 Which just happens to be this exact bar of Lindt that I just mentioned.6\n\nHowever, this is also 270 calories daily, consisting of 25 grams (225 calories) of fat, 4 grams (16 calories) of carbs, and 7 grams of protein (no amino acid profile) (28 calories).\n\nUmm\u2026 sorry to burst your bubble, but this is just fat and high calories. No vitamins or minerals, other than some iron.\n\nYou\u2019ll get FAR more benefits out of 2 tablespoons of healthy fats (same calories) such as Udo\u2019s oil, fish, hemp, olive, and macadamia oil. Which all consist of ESSENTIAL fats that you NEED to survive.\n\nNow, some people say just have this as a treat in moderation. While others tell you to have them daily.\n\nThis is a lot of empty calories to have daily, especially for most people who probably need to lose unwanted fat.\n\nAnd for 99% of people, it\u2019s very hard to have chocolate, in moderation, as an \u201coccasional treat\u201d. I have tremendous willpower and I don\u2019t crave sweets and trust me, after a while, \u201cmoderation\u201d is going to turn into something daily.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened to my mom.\n\nWhen I told her to stop eating the chocolate, she lost 2 lbs in a month.\n\nIF you want to have chocolate, go ahead. Enjoy it because you like chocolate.\n\nBut please don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking that you\u2019re doing your body a favor. And that it\u2019s healthy and good for you.\n\nThere are a lot of other healthy foods at the same calories or less.\n\nAnd if you\u2019d like to lose some fat, then consider getting all the benefits and so much more, through herbs and supplements \u2013 it\u2019s far more powerful and has no calories.\n\nAnd YES, herbs are natural \u2013 but a chocolate bar is most definitely NOT!\n\nhttps://gundrymd.com/dark-chocolate-polyphenols/\n\nhttps://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/09/21/can-eating-this-sweet-treat-decrease-risk-of-the-1-cause-of-death.aspx\n\nhttps://draxe.com/nutrition/article/benefits-of-dark-chocolate/\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/10/18/15995478/chocolate-health-benefits-heart-disease\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2010.03108.x/abstract\n\nhttps://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/lindt/excellence-noirissime-99%25-cocoa",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss/warning-doing-cardio-in-fasted-state-causes-muscle-loss-fat-gain/",
    "content": "The other day I got asked the following question:\n\nDr. Sam \u2013 I want to lose fat and gain muscle. I\u2019m doing intermittent fasting and sometimes a ketogenic diet. However, my question is about doing cardio on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning. I hear it\u2019s the best way to lose fat \u2013 can you please tell me the real truth?\n\nThis is a great question because it\u2019s a very popular topic and one that I used to believe in myself when I was younger.\n\nTheories on Cardio and Fasting\n\nFor years, many experts will tell you that the best way to lose fat is to do cardio exercise first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach, after an overnight fast.\n\nThe \u201ctheory\u201d for this is that your glycogen stores were depleted during your sleep. So, there was no \u201csugar\u201d or \u201ccarbs\u201d to burn off and thus, the cardio exercise would go directly into fat-burning mode.\n\nSo you\u2019re saving time and burning more fat.\n\nHowever, doing cardio after a meal or when you\u2019re not depleted, means that you FIRST have to burn off all the sugar, before you can go into burning off the fatty acids.\n\nSo, this meant that the cardio session was just burning off the food you ate, NOT actually burning off body fat. It wasn\u2019t very efficient.\n\nAnd guess what, this made perfect sense to me.\n\nMy Own Experience with Fasting\n\nSo, years ago, I would get up in the morning, after not eating for at least 8-10 hours. I\u2019d drink some water and then go for a jog or head on over to the gym and do some incline treadmill or ride the bike or something similar.\n\nI\u2019d do this for at least 30 minutes and work up a nice sweat. Plus with the extra endorphins from the intense cardio, I was super energized and happy. It was a natural high. I felt great. It was a nice way to start the day.\n\nThen I\u2019d come home, I\u2019d take a shower, and I\u2019d wait about an hour before I\u2019d eat, so the \u201cfat-burning\u201d from the cardio session would continue.\n\nAnd the good news is that I did lose weight and I lost it quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, I lost a lot of muscle in the process.\n\nLooking at just the scale, I was kicking ass. I was losing weight.\n\nBut looking in the mirror, how my clothes fit and how I was performing in the gym when lifting weights \u2013 well, for sure I was losing muscle.\n\nI was slowly getting smaller and weaker.\n\nIn 2 months, I lost about 10 lbs. But looking in the mirror, it looked like I only lost 2-3 lbs of fat. I looked flat, stringy, and basically, I had that dreaded \u201cskinny/fat\u201d look.\n\nSo I figured maybe I wasn\u2019t eating enough food, so I increased my calories.\n\nThe weight loss stopped, but I didn\u2019t look any better.\n\nThe bottom line was that I lost weight, but a lot of it was valuable muscle.\n\nSo, why did this happen? Did I do something wrong?\n\nHow Cardio Affected My Body\u2026\n\nWell, the reason is that the cardio was stressing my body. It was too intense. I had no food in my system, so my body thought something must be wrong. He\u2019s hungry and he\u2019s running away from something.\n\nSo, it wants to protect and it goes into survival mode.\n\nIt increases stress hormones, such as cortisol. It\u2019ll then lower thyroid levels, to slow down your metabolism. It also messes up with your sex hormones.\n\nI know this for a fact because I started doing both saliva and blood tests to see what was going on. My cortisol levels were like double the high range.\n\nAnd, my testosterone had dropped in the process as well.\n\nAnd there were other negative changes in other hormones.\n\nAnd over the years, I\u2019ve seen this happen over and over again with other people. And it happens to certain people and body types much worse.\n\nWomen, for example, lose muscle more than men doing intense cardio in a fasted state.\n\nSkinnier, \u201cectomorphs\u201d for sure lose a lot more muscle, as well.\n\nPeople who lift weights, lose muscle as well.\n\nThe people that can do intense cardio in a fasted state tend to be genetically muscular people \u2013 mesomorph or endomorph who put on fat quickly.\n\nAlso, people taking steroids can get away with this easily.\n\nSo, knowing what I know now, I would do things differently.\n\nI would NEVER do intense cardio, any time of the day. This means NO running, jogging, biking, etc. Only a few genetically gifted people can do this and not lose muscle.\n\nIf you want to do cardio in a fasted state in the morning, that\u2019s fine. But do a 15-30 min brisk walk. Just enough that you\u2019re breathing hard, but you can still carry a conversation. NO intense cardio, running, jogging, etc.\n\nInstead of doing long cardio sessions, such as 30-60 min brisk walks, it\u2019s best to do multiple smaller sessions. For example, 10-15 minutes, 3x daily. Before or after a meal.\n\nDoing the above will allow you to burn more fat, NOT lose muscle and most importantly, turn on your fat-burning hormones and increase your metabolism, all day long.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do. It\u2019s less stressful. You can do it any time, any place and it won\u2019t cost you anything.\n\nMore importantly, it won\u2019t screw up your hormones and accelerate aging.\n\nAnd if you want more details about how to naturally turn on your fat-burning hormones all day long, make sure you visit this special link.\n\nYou\u2019ll also discover why 93% of diet and exercise programs fail and how to quickly fix it.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "People who work out, lift weights and want to build muscle and stay lean \u2013 eat a lot of protein. Unfortunately, too much animal protein isn\u2019t good for you.\n\nOf course, vegans will argue that ALL animal protein is bad for you. I don\u2019t agree with that. However, I do agree that most animal protein these days isn\u2019t good because of how it\u2019s raised.\n\nAdditionally, too much animal protein can become toxic to the body, if your goal is also longevity.\n\nSo today, in 2025 I\u2019m going to speak about vegan protein powders.\n\nThis way, you can still eat that extra protein for building muscle and staying lean, but it doesn\u2019t have to be from animal sources.\n\nLuckily, these days, we have access to some really great vegan protein powders that are probably just as good as the animal sources. They are complete proteins with all the amino acids.\n\nMy Personal Protein Intake\n\nNow, before I start, let me give you a little background about my own protein consumption.\n\nI have about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. I weigh about 200 lbs and thus, I average about 200 grams daily.\n\nSome days less and some days more. I did an article about protein cycling and building more muscle.\n\nMy main sources of protein are from:\n\nPasture-raised whole eggs\n\nWhey protein isolate (25 grams on workout days)\n\nVegan protein powders\n\nYes, you\u2019ll see no chicken, turkey, or shellfish. Chicken these days is fake and shellfish are bottom feeders.\n\nVegan Protein Powders\n\nNow, there are lots of different vegan protein powders, some of the more popular ones are:\n\nSoy \u2013 I\u2019m not a fan of soy. It does tend to lower thyroid levels and increase estrogen. IF you want to use it, make sure it\u2019s Non-GMO and use in small amounts.\n\nHemp \u2013 this is a great food source. It has protein, fat, carbs, and lots of fiber. I wouldn\u2019t use it by itself because it can be a bit \u201cearthy\u201d if you know what I mean. I\u2019d do a mixture of it with other vegan powders.\n\nRice \u2013 this is easy to digest, has all the amino acids, almost no carbs or fats, and has no sugar. This is one of my favorites.\n\nPea \u2013 this is very popular, especially in protein bars and so forth. It creates a thicker consistency than other powders. It\u2019s all protein with just 1 gram of fat and carbs, no sugar. BUT, it can cause inflammation. So again, you want to use a lower dose and mix it with other vegan powders.\n\nAlfalfa Greens \u2013 it\u2019s similar to hemp, but not as good and it\u2019s very \u201cearthy\u201d in taste. So, a little goes a long way. It\u2019s also very hard to mix.\n\nWhat Do I Personally Use?\n\nFor me, I have my own powder mixed with my specifications, which you can do the same. I typically do:\n\n50% \u2013 Rice 25% \u2013 Hemp 25% \u2013 Pea\n\nHowever, this will NOT mix as easily as whey protein. You can\u2019t just add water to a shaker. You\u2019ll have to use a blender.\n\nI actually mix all of this into a protein cookie that I make. Which consists of other vegan ingredients (oats, puffed millet, coconut, and some nuts).\n\nA recipe I can give you if you\u2019d like, just let me know if you are interested.\n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019ll need to see what works for you and your taste buds.\n\nYou can buy these vegan powders pre-made by many companies. BUT, they typically do throw in lots of other junk, sugars and so forth. AND, it\u2019ll cost you more.\n\nHowever, you can now make your own formula, at half the price without any junk in there.\n\nI\u2019ve made an article about how I make my custom proteins.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re a vegan or you simply want to reduce some of your animal protein, now you can with these top-quality vegan protein powders.",

    "content": "I\u2019ve had probably a dozen guys ask me what I think about the One Meal A Day diet.\n\nOne person was telling me about all the health benefits.\n\nAnother said how it helped them lose weight.\n\nTwo people said how they loved the freedom and the fact they could eat whatever they wanted.\n\nSo for those of you who don\u2019t know, the One Meal A Day (OMAD) diet is like an extreme version of Intermittent Fasting. You basically just eat once a day. That\u2019s it. And it\u2019s usually like dinner, where you can be social and go out on a date or with friends.\n\nIn fact, I know of two, very well-known doctors who follow it \u2013 one of them being a cardiologist.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m not here to drop names or say anything negative about anyone, especially because I like a lot of what these two doctors say \u2013 of course, they make a lot of mistakes too based on misinformed generalities.\n\nFirst of all, the diet is very unhealthy because the entire selling point of it is that you can eat whatever you want in that one meal. Pizza, ice cream, pastries, alcohol, and so forth. After all, you are only eating ONCE, might as well load up on your favorites.\n\nSure, this can lead to fake weight loss \u2013 which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute.\n\nBut your body\u2019s health, energy levels, fitness, and longevity is about NUTRIENTS that are ABSORBED. Not stupid, unhealthy calories that you ingest.\n\nIf you want to lie to yourself and pretend this is a healthy diet so you can justify eating whatever you want \u2013 that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s your life. But eating junk daily is NOT healthy and you\u2019ll pay the price months and years later and I think you already know this!\n\nNot For People Who Want Muscles\n\nFirst, anyone who wants to have muscles and exercises, which I think should be EVERYONE \u2013 cannot and should not follow this diet.\n\nYou need protein to repair your body \u2013 especially your muscles. And, protein can\u2019t be stored, unlike carbohydrates and fats. And thus, you need to eat protein throughout the day, to heal and repair your body, including muscles.\n\nONCE a day isn\u2019t enough. Nor can you absorb all of it in one sitting, with one meal.\n\nPlus, your performance, strength, and stamina will drop slowly and you\u2019ll just fall apart over the next few months and years.\n\nFor those of you who think you\u2019re losing weight on this diet because something magical happens by not eating for 23 hours, you\u2019re ignorant or delusional.\n\nYou\u2019re losing weight because you\u2019re simply eating and drinking fewer calories, that is it!\n\nAnd mind you, I said \u201cweight\u201d, not FAT loss.\n\nThis is because this diet slows down your metabolism and initially you\u2019ll lose some water and fat and then it\u2019ll be more muscle than fat and finally it\u2019ll just be more and more muscle.\n\nYou\u2019ll buy smaller-sized clothes, but you\u2019re losing that valuable and youthful muscle, which is the LAST thing you want to do.\n\nOMAD Potential Health Benefits\n\nHowever, there are health benefits \u2013 better blood sugar, blood pressure, and so forth. But, it\u2019s from the weight loss due to the lower caloric intake. NOT because you\u2019re eating one meal a day.\n\nBy the way, you should NOT do this if you have blood sugar problems such as hypoglycemia or you\u2019re diabetic.\n\nAnd if you also tend to have low blood pressure, this is also a bad diet.\n\nYou should also NOT follow this diet if you:\n\nHave THYROID problems.\n\nIf you want to have HIGHER testosterone, this diet lowers it.\n\nIf you want to REDUCE stress hormones such as cortisol, this diet increases it.\n\nIn fact, this type of diet screws up so many of your hormones because your body thinks it\u2019s STARVING.\n\nThe one well-known doctor I mentioned earlier, he spoke in a video about what he eats in that one meal. I swear, it was barely 1,000 calories. It WAS a very healthy meal and that\u2019s great.\n\nBut to eat 1,000 calories a day isn\u2019t a good idea. You\u2019re not getting enough calories or nutrients.\n\nYour body WILL slow down, to go into survival mode.\n\nThe ONLY Thing I Like About OMAD\n\nThere\u2019s only ONE thing I like about eating one meal a day and that\u2019s freedom. Honestly, the fact that you don\u2019t have to cook and clean so often or have to stop what you\u2019re doing to eat, 4-6x daily is fantastic.\n\nIt\u2019s one less thing to think about and it\u2019s a big part of my day! Personally, I find eating to be a drag \u2013 especially eating healthy foods. But it needs to be done to achieve my goals, so it is what it is.\n\nAnd because of this, I suggest you do cyclical intermittent fasting. I\u2019ve done an article about this, you can click on this link and read about it.\n\nJust remember that all of this always comes down to optimizing your youth hormones and turning on your \u201cfat-burning genes\u201d for both short and more importantly, LONG-TERM results.\n\nIn fact, this is exactly why most diet and exercise programs fail and I\u2019ve got a link about this topic as well.\n\nTake a look at both topics and articles right now, while it\u2019s fresh on your mind.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/5-surprising-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar-scientifically-proven-facts/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019ve been using apple cider vinegar for over a decade now because of the various health benefits.\n\nAnd today I\u2019m going to quickly reveal 5 surprising and scientifically proven benefits of apple cider vinegar. And I\u2019ll end with the correct dose and type, for maximum health benefits. And also what to avoid.\n\nKills Harmful Bacteria\n\nWhen I was a kid, I remember seeing my grandmother wash the toilet and sink and other things around the house, using a homemade mixture of vinegar and water. I remember asking her, \u201cWhy not just use one of those commercial products?\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cThis is safer, it\u2019s natural, it\u2019s not toxic, and it kills germs and bacteria\u201d.\n\nThis is true because vinegar can help kill pathogens, which is bacteria, viruses, and other organisms that can cause disease.1\n\nIn fact, Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, used vinegar for wound cleaning over two thousand years ago.\n\nHelps Support Healthy Blood Sugar Levels\n\nI think one of the most well-known and popular uses of Vinegar is the fact it can help support healthy blood sugar levels. And as I\u2019ve stated in previous articles, high blood sugar is a common denominator of health problems\n\nStudies have shown that vinegar can\n\nImprove insulin sensitivity during a high-carb meal by 19\u201334%.2\n\nReduce blood sugar by 34% after eating 50 grams of white bread.3\n\nNumerous other studies in humans show that vinegar can improve insulin function and blood sugar levels after meals.4,5\n\nSo if you\u2019re concerned about your blood sugar, start using some vinegar in your diet.\n\nHelps You Lose Weight & Shrinks Belly Fat\n\nVinegar has also been shown to help you lose weight and shrink that stubborn belly fat.\n\nIt does so through 2 primary ways\n\nIncreases satiety and thus, makes you feel fuller and less hungry.\n\nLowering of the blood sugar. High insulin levels stores body fat.\n\nDon\u2019t expect miracles. Studies show weight loss is about 2-3 pounds after 3 months, but that\u2019s still a good start, and its progress \u2013 which is always great.6\n\nIt May Help Avoid Getting Tumors\n\nTo my surprise, there are numerous studies showing that various types of vinegar can kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.7-9\n\nUnfortunately, these studies were done on rats and not on humans. But, hey\u2026 it\u2019s still very positive, right?\n\nSupports Healthy Cholesterol & Heart Health\n\nDid you know that heart disease is the world\u2019s number one killer and a common cause of premature death?10\n\nStudies have shown that apple cider vinegar can help support healthy cholesterol and fatty triglyceride levels. Plus, it even helps support healthy blood pressure. And let\u2019s not forget the support of healthy blood sugar levels \u2013 another common risk factor for heart problems.\n\nAgain \u2013 these studies were done on animals and not humans.\n\nHowever, if you do want proven solutions for supporting healthy cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure levels, and so forth, based on the usage of real humans, make sure you visit the articles that I will link below.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s talk about the best type of Vinegar and the dosage.\n\nI use Bragg\u2019s Organic Apple Cider Vinegar and I get the one that says, With The \u201cMother\u201d on it\u2026. Which are strands of proteins, enzymes and friendly bacteria that give the product a murky appearance.\n\nSome people believe that the \u201cmother\u201d is responsible for most of the health benefits, although there are currently no studies to support this.\n\nI take 1 tablespoon, 3x daily. For sure in the morning and at night and most of the time, mid-day.\n\nI also add a tablespoon of organic lemon juice in it as well for taste and also some additional and similar health benefits.\n\nI actually mix it all in a cup of water and drink it down, so it dilutes the taste.\n\nYou can do it on an empty stomach but for some people that cause discomfort so you can do it a few minutes before a meal.\n\nBTW, I don\u2019t like the pills. They aren\u2019t as beneficial and they cost much more. And I hate wasting money and getting an inferior product that\u2019s less effective.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar has many health benefits. Don\u2019t expect miracles, but it\u2019s inexpensive and easy to use.\n\nAs promised, here are the important links for more details on supporting healthy\n\nblood pressure levels\n\nand Bragg\u2019s apple cider vinegar.\n\nVisit the links above and let me know how these solutions work for you!\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788933/\n\nhttp://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/1/281.long\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7796781\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28292654\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27213723\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661687\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1541-4337.12228/full\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15630260\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15149153\n\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/why-olive-oil-is-bad-for-you-unless-you-do-this/",
    "content": "If you consume olive oil, then you must read today\u2019s short article.\n\nIt\u2019s about how most olive oils are just bad for you and are, in fact, fake!\n\nObviously, we all hear how good olive oil is.\n\nIn fact, my parents used to consume that toxic, unhealthy, and cheap canola oil. Usually, it was Mazola.\n\nBut now, they\u2019ve switched over to \u201chealthy olive oil\u201d \u2026 which is almost the same junk and I\u2019ll tell you why in a minute.\n\nAnd one reason olive oil is such a popular \u201chealthy oil\u201d or food is that people in Mediterranean areas, who live longer than the rest of us, consume more olive oil.\n\nBased on this, silly scientists and doctors now think that THIS is the main reason these people are living longer lives than the rest of us.\n\nWhich, I don\u2019t agree with.\n\nIt\u2019s never one thing. It\u2019s usually a combination of many factors \u2013 genetics and hormones always being a common denominator.\n\nIn fact, Cardiologist Dr. Gundry thinks Olive oil is the greatest food on the planet and tells you to consume 12 tablespoons daily.\n\nI definitely don\u2019t agree with Dr. Gundry on this. That\u2019s at least 1500 calories daily from just this ONE food source.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m totally against any extreme diets.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should be almost all fat or all carbs or all protein or never eat an entire macronutrient and so on and so forth.\n\nIt\u2019s just stupid and not a long-term plan \u2013 for health, convenience, or success!\n\nNow, I made an article recently about the \u201c3 Best & Most Affordable Testosterone Boosting Foods that are Clinically Proven\u201d.\n\nAnd one of the foods I mentioned were fats, coconut, and olive oil. I\u2019ve posted a link to that article if you want to know what the other 2 foods are.\n\nThe BEST Olive Oil Brand\n\nAnyway, I had numerous people ask the same question, \u201cDr. Robbins \u2013 there are so many olive oil brands, what\u2019s the best? I heard there are a lot of scam brands. What do you use?\u201d\n\nMost olive oil, probably at least 80% or more, does NOT contain olive oil.\n\nOr, it\u2019s a mixture of other oils and SMALL amounts of olive oil.\n\nAnd THIS is exactly what happened to my parents.\n\nI looked at their olive oil and it was a \u201cblend\u201d. This picture is very typical of what companies do to trick us.\n\nThe \u201cExtra Virgin Olive Oil\u201d is in SUPER BIG font.\n\nWhile the \u201cCanola Oil\u201d is much smaller and can barely be seen. Same with the word, \u201cblend\u201d at the bottom. It\u2019s like camouflage in there.\n\nSo, you must read the labels and make sure on the ingredient panel, it says \u201c100%, cold-pressed, organic olive oil\u201d and so forth.\n\nThis is the company I use, Bragg.\n\nI put a direct link to it at Amazon (16oz or 32oz), if you want to give it a try or read more about it.\n\nWhen you taste it, you can tell the difference.\n\nThe quality is very good and the best part is that it\u2019s not expensive.\n\nThere are other brands just as good and maybe better, but it\u2019ll also cost us 3-6x more.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s not worth it.\n\nHow Much Is Safe to Consume?\n\nI take probably 1 or maybe 2 tablespoons daily. This is in addition to other healthy fats I consume. Such as fish and avocados.\n\nSo, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m consuming 12+ tablespoons daily of Olive oil as Dr. Gundry suggests.\n\nAlso, I keep most of the oil in the fridge, so it stays fresh. And a small amount of it outside, in a dark glass bottle for daily use.\n\nI just eat it raw or usually on a salad. I don\u2019t cook or heat or fry my oils because it changes their structure of it.\n\nHowever, you can cook in low heat with olive oil and coconut as well.\n\nAnd I believe eating green olives is better for you than olive oil. The whole olives are in a natural form and will digest and absorb differently and better than the oil version.\n\nThey are also higher in polyphenols and other important anti-inflammatory nutrients.\n\nAs you\u2019ve heard me say many times \u2013 inflammation is a primary cause of so many health problems, including weight gain.\n\nAnd I have a free email series about the 3 best ways to reduce inflammation \u2013 I suggest you sign up now to reduce your inflammation as soon as possible.\n\nSo, there you have it.\n\nMost olive oils are fake.\n\nMake sure you read the labels.\n\nI use Amazon for Bragg\u2019s Olive oil if you want to try it.\n\nTake care of your body. It\u2019s easy, once you know what to do.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/does-high-protein-cause-kidney-damage-or-stones-clinical-evidence/",
    "content": "I was asked the other day if having a high-protein diet can cause kidney damage or even kidney stones.\n\nI think this is an important question because so many people are on high-protein diets. Or, they put a lot of emphasis on getting protein with all their meals.\n\nThis is especially true for people who are working out and wanting to gain muscle or even when dieting to lose fat.\n\nPlus, so many people are also drinking more protein shakes using one of the most popular supplements on the planet and the most popular protein powder \u2013 which uses whey protein.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to talk about:\n\nClinical evidence regarding protein intake and how it affects kidney function\n\nIf high protein is linked to kidney stones\n\nI\u2019ll also reveal my personal experience with high protein diets \u2013 including people I personally know who were on kidney dialysis and how two of them died\n\nAnd how much protein you need and the best type of protein to eat, including powders\n\nCan Protein Cause Kidney Damage?\n\nThe kidneys are remarkable organs that filter waste compounds, excess nutrients, and liquids out of the bloodstream, producing urine.\n\nAbout 20% of the blood your heart pumps through your body goes to the kidneys\u2026 which is about 48 gallons (180 liters) of blood being filtered through the kidneys every single day.\n\nSo, they are working a lot.\n\nAnd unlike the liver, your kidneys don\u2019t have regenerative properties. So, you better take good care of them.\n\nEating a high-protein meal can raise the pressure inside the kidneys and cause them to filter more blood than usual, which means more stress.1, 2, and Doing this 5-7x daily with a high protein diet that many workout people are following, puts constant stress on the kidneys all day long.\n\nHowever, a detailed review of 74 short-term studies on protein\u2019s effects on the kidneys concluded that there is no reason to restrict protein intake in healthy people.3\n\nUnfortunately, there is evidence that a high-protein diet can be harmful, especially for people with kidney disease, and cause further damage.4, 5\n\nSUMMARY: Based on short-term studies, if you are a healthy person and don\u2019t have kidney disease, then you can enjoy a higher-protein diet.\n\nNOTE: Please keep in mind that all of these studies were not long-term, with people who ate high-protein diets for months and years at a time, as many of us do. And I personally have in the past.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s more to this situation and I want to share some personal stories with you in a minute.\n\nIncluding myself eating a very high protein diet and multiple people in my life having kidney damage and two people that actually died from kidney failure.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s first talk about kidney stones.\n\nDoes A High Protein Diet Cause Kidney Stones\n\nThe answer is yes based on clinical studies stating that diets heavy on foods that are high in protein, especially if combined with low carbohydrates, can increase the risk of kidney stones and reduce the body\u2019s ability to absorb calcium after just six weeks.6\n\nI\u2019ll be doing a more detailed article in the near future about kidney stones, what causes them, and how to prevent them from happening.\n\nNeedless to say, if you have had kidney stones or have a family history or similar, make sure you lower your protein intake, especially from animal sources.\n\nSo far what we\u2019ve learned is that:\n\nShort-term studies show that in healthy people, high protein diets don\u2019t negatively affect your kidneys\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about kidney stones, then yes \u2013 higher protein diets do make this situation worse\n\nNow, in part two I\u2019ll reveal:\n\nMy personal story with high protein diets, including kidney damage and death.\n\nHow much protein you should eat, which will allow you to still gain muscle and lose fat, without harming your kidneys\n\nThe best and safest protein sources\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123919342000138 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3602135/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK224634/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12639078 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15073493?dopt=Abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1169452/\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123919342000138\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3602135/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK224634/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12639078\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15073493?dopt=Abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1169452/",

    "content": "So I\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions about Mustard Oil and if it\u2019s okay to eat it. And the truth is, I really didn\u2019t know much about this oil. Other than the mustard I put on my hotdogs growing up, I had no clue what Mustard Oil was and if it\u2019s dangerous or healthy, toxic, or tasty.\n\nThe good news is that I\u2019m going to give you a quick summary of it in today\u2019s article and share with you what I\u2019ve learned.\n\nMustard oil is made from pressing the seeds of a mustard plant to produce a spicy oil.\n\nOne reason I hadn\u2019t heard much about it is that mustard oil is popular in Eastern cooking, although some American chefs have begun experimenting with the oil, which has a heat and distinctive flavor to it.\n\nReal mustard oil, however, is actually banned for cooking uses by the FDA.\n\nThis is because it contains an ingredient called erucic acid that has been shown to cause heart problems. Erucic acid is a fatty acid that is not well metabolized. It\u2019s considered a contaminant.\n\nHowever, the FDA does allow a different type of oil, called mustard essential oil, to be sold for cooking. Mustard essential oil is made from steam distillation of mustard seeds. It\u2019s considered safe for use in cooking by the FDA.\n\nBoth mustard oil and the mustard essential oil is used for massage, but only the \u201cessential\u201d version can be used for cooking.\n\nHowever, there are some benefits to mustard essential oil.\n\n2. Contains Antibacterial and Antifungal Properties\n\n4. Reduces Pain Associated with Inflammation\n\n5. Treats Gum Disease\n\nI can tell you more, but let me just give you the bottom line for Mustard Oil.\n\nRegular, unregulated mustard oil can be dangerous, so don\u2019t bother using it.\n\nThe \u201cessential\u201d oil version is much safer and you can even cook with it. However, I wouldn\u2019t bother.\n\nYou can use it on your skin, it\u2019s better and less risky than eating it. However, even with that, I suggest using other oils \u2013 Emu, Almond, Coconut, etc.\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 an interesting oil, but there are much better, healthier, and safer oils for you to use topically and in your foods.",

    "content": "Welcome to my QA series.\n\nToday\u2019s question is from a previous video I made entitled, \u201cKetogenic Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts\u201d, which you can watch here.\n\nSo the question that was posted is: \u201cHow does a ketogenic diet affect muscle growth? Can I gain muscle being on a keto diet?\u2026 Ever since I\u2019ve been following this diet, I feel like I\u2019m getting smaller and weaker.\u201d\n\nAs a quick summary \u2013 a ketogenic diet is when you are basically eating no carbohydrates and very little protein and thus, the majority of your calories is from FAT.\n\nAfter about 3 days of not having any carbohydrates in your diet, your body will run out of \u201cglucose\u201d and will then start using KETONES as fuel.\n\nNow, this is a good way to burn fat for many people because without carbs and glucose, your blood sugar and insulin production will be low and your food will have a harder time being converted to body fat.\n\nHowever, this is NOT a good way to gain muscle. In fact, long-term ketogenic diets will actually cause muscle loss.\n\nYour muscles prefer glucose for energy. Doing any kind of sport or lifting weights where your muscles require fast contraction, glucose is the preferred fuel.\n\nKetones are a great fuel source for your brain, but not for your muscles.\n\nAlso, long-term keto diets cause a decrease in testosterone and other androgens, thyroid production, and IGF \u2013 which is the main anabolic hormone that is converted from Growth Hormone (GH).\n\nExperts will say how ketogenic diets will increase Growth Hormone and how great that is. But who cares because GH does nothing by itself?\n\nGH only works when it converts to IGF (Insulin-like Growth Factor) \u2013 which requires insulin and thyroid \u2014 TWO hormones that are depleted on a ketogenic diet.\n\nRemember, the way you look and feel is ALL genetics and hormones. You can\u2019t change your genetics, but you CAN control and optimize your hormones, which influence your genetics.\n\n\u201cLean\u201d people have much better fat-burning hormones than \u201coverweight\u201d people.\n\nSimilarly, \u201cmuscular\u201d people have better muscle-building hormones than \u201cskinny/weak\u201d people.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to follow a ketogenic diet to lose weight, yet you still want to build muscle \u2013 you\u2019ll have to cycle it carefully and not do it long-term. No more than 2 weeks of ketosis and I actually prefer something like 7 days on, 3 days off.\n\nBut, that\u2019s another topic for another article.\n\nAnd if you want to lose fat and still build muscle at the same time, you can watch a great video about this topic and how you can quickly turn ON your \u201cfat-burning genes\u201d.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "In a previous article, I mentioned how white rice is better for you than brown rice. How there are no real benefits to eating brown rice, despite what so-called \u201cexperts\u201d and nutritionist say.\n\nIn fact, brown rice is actually unhealthy for you because it contains Phytic Acid, which inhibits the absorption of important minerals and makes it more difficult to digest proteins and starches. This leads to GI problems, indigestion, allergies, bloat, gas, etc.\n\nAdditionally, brown rice, like most \u201cgrains\u201d, \u2026 also contains Lectins \u2013 which cause inflammation and are at the root of causing many of our diseases and physiological discomforts.1-2\n\nSo the bottom line is that white rice is good for you and over 4 BILLION people eat it daily, giving you further proof.\n\nUnfortunately, as tasty and inexpensive as rice is \u2013 people tend to eat too much of it.\n\nHowever, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you could eat the same amount of rice, but magically \u201cerase\u201d 50% of the calories from it?\n\nAnd at the same time, improve the glycemic index and thus, less blood sugar issues.\n\nWell, the good news is that this can easily be done and it\u2019s clinically proven to work. So, here\u2019s how you do it.\n\nRinse 1 cup of white rice, until the water is clear.\n\nAdd 1 teaspoon of coconut oil\n\nAdd the 1 cup of white rice that you just rinsed and washed.\n\nCook the rice for about 30 minutes.\n\nIMPORTANT: Let the rice cool down in the refrigerator for about 12 hours.\n\nSo, how and why does this work?\n\nThe starch in rice is broken down by our bodies into simple sugars. These sugars get stored and then converted into glucose, which helps give us energy. But when the body has more glucose than it can use, the unused portion gets converted to body fat.\n\nRice, however, has two types of starches\u2014digestible and indigestible\u2014and only the carbs our digestive system can absorb, get broken down into sugars.\n\nAnd the goal here is to convert the digestible, into more indigestible carbs.\n\nSo if it cannot get absorbed, it can\u2019t get stored and turned into body fat \u2013 this is a very important concept to understand.\n\nTo convert digestible starch to indigestible, there are two key steps to the process of cooking rice.\n\nFirst, you need to put a teaspoon of coconut oil into boiling water before adding the cup of rice. The oil enters the starch granules in the rice, changing their structure to be resistant to the enzymes that would normally break down the starch during digestion.\n\nSecondly, after the rice is done cooking, you need to refrigerate it for 12 hours. This part is essential because the cooling process expels the digestible part of the starch. Once outside the rice granules, the molecules form strong bonds, turning them into indigestible starch.\n\nThe more resistant starch, the fewer calories we can absorb.\n\nThe good news is that indigestible starch doesn\u2019t change when the rice is later reheated.\n\nSo, there you have it. The SECRET here is in the order and preparation \u2013 which tends to be true for many things in life.\n\nAnd the reason this works is because calories that aren\u2019t absorbed, can\u2019t be converted to body fat.\n\nWell, the really cool part is that there are special fibers that you can take, before eating meals with fat and/or carbs and sugars, that will BLOCK up to 30% of the calories from being absorbed.\n\nSo, you can take this special fiber, eat a 600-calorie pizza and yet, only 400 calories get absorbed.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple and proven way to lose weight or still enjoy some of your favorite \u201ccheat meals\u201d, without gaining weight or feeling guilty.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from an article I wrote entitled, \u201cWhy Low Blood Sugar Can Be BAD For Your Health\u201d.\n\nNow, in that article I stated how you want stable blood sugar levels \u2013 obviously, not \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d. This is important for anyone who wants to:\n\nAvoid, prevent or reverse blood sugar problems\n\nIncrease energy levels\n\nLive a healthier, longer life\u2026 while reducing health problems and slow the aging process\n\nNow, in that article, I mentioned different foods to eat and avoid and I stated how you want to \u201ceat white rice and NOT brown rice\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t get into the details, but I immediately got a lot of questions asking \u201cwhy\u201d. I decided to redo this topic in 2025 as it\u2019s very important.\n\nMYTHS About Brown Rice\n\nAnd this is obviously a great question because most of the so-called \u201cexperts\u201d, doctors, and nutritionists keep talking about the benefits of brown rice and that you should avoid white rice.\n\nAnd they erroneously tell you this because they say how brown rice:\n\n\u201chas more protein\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s only ONE gram\n\n\u201chas more fiber\u201d \u2014 but this is only TWO grams\n\n\u201chas lower glycemic index\u201d and thus, doesn\u2019t affect your blood sugar levels as much \u2014 but this too is WRONG.\n\nHow To Lower Glycemic Index Of White Rice\n\nFirst of all, there are different forms of white rice \u2013 but needless to say, white rice can actually have a LOWER glycemic index than brown rice \u2014 depending on how it\u2019s cooked.2\n\nYou can read about how you can actually lower BOTH the glycemic index AND the calorie content of white rice, depending on how you cook it, in this article: A Simple & Proven Way to Cut Rice Calories by 50%.\n\nThus, you can eat rice and not worry about it.\n\nNo Benefit To Brown Rice\n\nAnyway, as you can see there\u2019s really no benefit with brown rice, compared to white.\n\nIn fact, these so-called \u201cexperts\u201d fail to mention how brown rice actually has MORE calories and carbs! \u2026 NOT good if you\u2019re trying to lose weight or keep your blood sugar stable, right?\n\nThe REAL Problem Of Brown Rice\n\nBut, here\u2019s the REAL problem with brown rice and how white rice is better AND safer for you.\n\nBrown rice has Phytic Acid, which is an \u201canti-nutrient\u201d. Phytic acid is a compound located in the rice bran \u2013 the part that gives brown rice its color.\n\nIn fact, this is true with most other \u201cwhole grains\u201d.\n\nSimply stated, phytic acid grabs on to important minerals and inhibits the enzymes we need to properly digest proteins and starches.1\n\nIf you\u2019re suffering from any food intolerance, allergies, sensitivity, or GI distress symptoms (bloat, gas, etc.) despite healthy eating\u2026 it could be the whole grains that you\u2019re eating and it\u2019s better to switch to eating white rice.\n\nThis is also because whole grains, such as brown rice, contain dangerous lectins.3\n\nAnd most people are allergic to lectins which cause inflammation in the body. And if you\u2019d like, I can also do an article about the toxicity of lectins.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t have to take my word for it or even the scientific facts. Just stop and think about it yourself.\n\nThey give WHITE rice to infants, NOT \u201cbrown\u201d rice.\n\nAll the cultures around the world \u2013 eat WHITE rice, not brown \u2014 Asians, Indians, Latins, Greeks, Italians, etc.\n\nAnyway, I hope you get the point by now.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that now you can eat all the rice you\u2019d like. I\u2019m just saying that your carbohydrate source should come from white rice, rather than brown rice or whole grains because of the Phytic Acid and Lectins.\n\nIf you want to learn more about supporting healthy blood sugar and losing weight, make sure you read these articles:\n\nHow to support healthy blood sugar levels, naturally \u2013 NO change in diet or exercise.\n\nWeight Loss secrets \u2013 Why 93% of diet and exercise programs fail.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a happy and healthy day!\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "It was not all that long ago when a vegan diet was considered impractical. The lack of meat products including dairy and honey meant that a person might lose out on the needed proteins and other nutrients their bodies needed.\n\nHowever, thanks to increasing interest in this type of diet along with a number of cookbooks that promote many vegan recipes, the sheer number of ways that vegans can enjoy their meals has led to a growth in their popularity in recent years. While still representing a small fraction of the population, there is no doubt that the vegan diet is here to stay.\n\nThe Advantages of the Vegan Diet\n\nLower LDL Cholesterol: Studies have shown that a strict vegan diet will help lower LDL cholesterol levels which are associated with heart disease.\n\nMore Fiber: The beans and other legumes provide plenty of fiber for the body which helps in the processing of food while assisting the digestive system.\n\nLower Blood Pressure: There are studies which have shown the beneficial effects the diet has on lowering blood pressure, which is associated in part with reduced LDL cholesterol levels also. For many, this is one of the main benefits of this diet.\n\nMore Antioxidants: Antioxidants are very beneficial to the body in that they fight the free radicals which prematurely age the skin, hair and nails. The result is a more youthful appearance as well as a detoxification of the body as well.\n\nBetter Self Control: One of the more interesting findings is that this type of diet actually helps promote better self control. By focusing on the process of selecting the right foods, the vegan diet really helps people to control the amount and type of food that they consume.\n\nThe Disadvantages of the Vegan Diet\n\nBig Change: Going vegan can be a difficult process for many because it represents a true radical change in their diet. This is especially true if you cannot replace the protein through using soy products and the like.\n\nLoss of Vitamins: In particular, vegan diets lack B12 which is a very important vitamin that needs to be supplemented in order to maintain the health of the body. The same is true for calcium and Vitamin D although there are natural, vegan sources available.\n\nIt May Interfere with Medical Condition: This is a radical change in your diet while having an existing medical condition such as diabetes or osteoporosis may result in a change in the way treatment may be delivered. You will need to consult with your physician before making such a change to ensure your treatment is on schedule.\n\nArguably, one of the biggest concerns is that going vegan might convince a person that their new diet is \u201cperfect\u201d which is far from the case. Going with a vegan diet does not necessarily mean that you will become healthier because there are still limitations.\n\nHowever, there is no doubt that eating more fruits, vegetables, legumes and other non-meat related products will have a positive impact on your health. It will simply require more attention to your diet to ensure that you receive all the vitamins, minerals and nutrients for your body.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "The vegetarian diet is one that does offer several advantages depending on the type of diet that is followed. There is the diet that allows for the products of animals such as dairy and honey while the other type avoids it altogether.\n\nEven taking into account both basic types of vegetarian diets, only a fraction of the US population actually follows them. For those who are looking to lose weight or add more nutrition to their diets, going vegetarian may be an answer, but it is really more complicated than that. You will have to be mindful of what you consume and realize that even a vegetarian diet still have complications as well.\n\nThe Advantages of a Vegetarian Diet\n\nWhat is true is that the basic elements of nutrition are the same whether they are found in plant or animal form. This means that the protein found in lean meat is the same as those found in beans or legumes. There are some other advantages as well.\n\nLose Weight: Following a proper vegetarian diet and reducing the amount of processed sugar should create the right conditions for shedding excess fat.\n\nLower Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: Eating a vegetarian diet has shown in studies to help lower the risk of heart disease. This is because the HDL cholesterol levels are raised while lowering the LDL levels if you consume plenty of mono and polyunsaturated fats.\n\nDietary Fiber: Legumes and beans contain plenty of good dietary fiber which helps your digestive system. Plus, you will also get plenty of protein when eating beans as well.\n\nKnowing what you Eat: It is well known that long-term vegetarian dieters have fewer hunger cravings and have better control over what they consume.\n\nThe Disadvantages of a Vegetarian Diet\n\nWhile there are considerable benefits, the vegetarian diet is not without its issues. For many, sticking to such a strict diet may be difficult especially in a world full of meat and meat by-products.\n\nVitamin B12 & Iron Deficiency: One of the biggest issues with the vegetarian diet is the lack of B12 and iron which are very important to your health and energy. While they can be supplemented through the use of daily vitamins, a vegetarian will have to be careful about what they consume. While calcium and Vitamin D are also lacking in many vegetarian diets, there are certain types of foods that can be eaten which will supplement them.\n\nThe Focus of the Diet: There are many foods that fit the vegetarian mold and yet are not healthy for you. French fries are vegetarian, yet they contain plenty of unhealthy trans fats which raise your LDL cholesterol levels. So, you need to be very careful about what type of vegetarian foods that you consume on a regular basis.\n\nOverall, the benefits of a vegetarian diet are certainly considerable, but they do not necessarily translate into healthier living unless you can avoid many of the foods that are detrimental to your health. This means that the choice to go vegetarian will have to be made with everything in mind before you switch your diet program.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "There are a lot of fad diets that hit the market every year, but standing out amongst these imitators is the Atkins Diet. It has many unique factors that help to make it the ideal diet for some folks to follow, both men and women, so that everyone can get the weight off and then keep it off. As with any diet, the Atkins eating plan has some definite pros and cons to it that may affect your decision in utilizing it for your weight loss plans. Let\u2019s take a look at both.\n\nThe Pros of the Atkins Diet\n\nThe primary benefit of using the Atkins Diet is that you get to eat a lot of the heavier, tastier foods that are loved. Steaks, hamburgers, and other meaty favorites are a staple of this diet and encourage people to stay on it because it includes foods they love. It provides immediate results in the first week, often 10 pounds or more, because it works to eliminate all of the refined carbohydrates that are in the standard American diet. No white bread or cake or baked goods, but the trade-off is immediate results and high protein items.\n\nAs an extra bonus, you\u2019re also staying away from many fruits and vegetables in the Atkins Diet that aren\u2019t loved much anyway. This gives people the excuse they need to stay away from foods they don\u2019t like. Because the diet tends to be more of a high protein option, people on the diet also tend to stay fuller longer, feeling more fulfilled.\n\nThe Cons of the Atkins Diet\n\nThe primary issue with the Atkins Diet is that it requires people to take supplements to get the nutrients that the body needs. Because you\u2019re avoiding whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, there is a high risk of developing a vitamin deficiency over time if these vitamins aren\u2019t added in a different way. This diet also greatly affects the levels of calcium in the body and forces people into a stage called \u201cketosis,\u201d which is where the body burns fat for fuel and this can affect the kidneys negatively.\n\nThe other problem is that people on this diet really crave carbs and even though they are reintroduced later on in the diet, the cravings can be hard to control. Because the body has been so deprived of this energy maker, people who return to eating carbs tend to gain more weight back after going off of the diet. That means the Atkins lifestyle requires high levels of willpower\u2026 or means a permanent change in eating habits.\n\nWith the chance to lose over 80 pounds rather quickly, people are always looking at Atkins as a way to get the weight off and keep it off. Could the Atkins Diet be the right lifestyle choice to help you achieve your weight loss goals? Weigh the pros and cons for yourself to see if it could be the right choice to make for you.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "title": "Pros and Cons of Alkaline Diet | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss-se/pros-and-cons-of-alkaline-diet/",
    "content": "The theory behind the Alkaline Diet is pretty simple: by eliminating the acidity in the body, it becomes impossible for diseases to exist. It also is designed to help you lose wheat by avoiding foods that promote acid production within the body. It has taken off thanks to its acceptance by Hollywood and popular celebrities, but does it work? Here is a look at the pros and cons of this diet.\n\nDoes It Really Prevent Disease?\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: nothing really changes the acidity levels of your bloodstream. What the Alkaline Diet does is promote lower acidity in the digestive tract. Over time, while consuming this diet on a regular basis, can prevent issues that are caused in the body because of too much acid. Kidney stones can be prevented, muscles and bones stay stronger, and heart function improves. A low acid diet may even reduce lower back pain.\n\nIs It Difficult to Follow?\n\nFor people who have some specific food allergies, the Alkaline Diet is not a good idea. Dairy, meat, eggs, processed foods, and most grains are not allowed. It\u2019s mostly nuts, seeds, and legumes with fruits and vegetables that can be eaten. Because protein comes from the soybeans and other legumes, those who have a legume allergy could become deficient nutritionally. Those with nut allergies will have a difficult time in getting the fats the body needs for a healthy metabolism as well.\n\nThere Is Lots of Water on This Diet\n\nMost people are constantly dehydrated and don\u2019t even realize it. By the time you feel thirsty, you\u2019ve already crossed into the threshold of not having enough water. With the Alkaline Diet, you will give your body plenty of water throughout the day and this will tend to give you more energy than you\u2019re used to having. When combined with an elimination of alcohol and caffeine, both which dehydrate the body, hydration levels can be maximized.\n\nThe Research Is Very Limited\n\nThere are some who believe that this diet is not necessary at all. Although there isn\u2019t evidence of this diet being good or bad, the foods that are eaten as part of the diet are well known to be helpful. By cutting back on sugar, reducing your salt intake, and eating healthier fruits and veggies, you\u2019ll be able to shed weight fast. The key benefits simply help to regulate the body just as any other healthy diet that eliminates processed items and high levels of sugar and salt would.\n\nSome foods that are very acidic on this diet are listed as alkaline because of how they are metabolized. The same is true in reverse and so people who think they\u2019re following the diet may not be at all. Other healthy food options, like walnuts, tea, or even pomegranates are listed as acidic and so don\u2019t fit in with the Alkaline Diet unless they are rationed. When people get confused, they tend to abandon a diet, and that might create rebound weight as an end result.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "You have probably heard of the Paleo diet which many people around the world have tried to lose unwanted fat by reverting to the diets of our pre-historic ancestors. The actual concept of the Paleo diet has been around for decades, but the actually use of it has only really increased significantly since the turn of the 21st century.\n\nHowever, the Paleo diet has come under some criticism for its very restrictive nature when it comes to the type of food that can be consumed. So, is the Paleo diet the right one for your needs?\n\nWhat is the Paleo Diet?\n\nThe Paleo diet is one that is based on consuming unprocessed foods. Essentially, foods that existed before the time agriculture was developed. These foods include meat, fruits and vegetables that are naturally grown and without the use of processed products.\n\nAlthough there has been some criticism that the foods available to pre-historic peoples was actually broader than the Paleo diet allows, it is true that people who consume this diet generally feel better and tend to shed the excess weight from their bodies.\n\nHowever, is the diet really as effective as advertised? There are certainly some advantages and disadvantages to the Paleo Diet.\n\nThe Pros of the Paleo Diet\n\nUnderstanding the Diet: Basically, if it comes in a package, then you don\u2019t eat it. This makes the Paleo diet one of the easiest to understand and follow.\n\nLow in Salt, Sugar & Unhealthy Fats: Although some of the fruits and vegetables have sugar in them, they are not the processed kind that puts fat on the body.\n\nEat more Fruits and Vegetables: This is a diet that emphasizes both so that you get to enjoy their healthy benefits. Plus, it will reduce your LDL cholesterol count as well as helping to prevent heart disease.\n\nHealthy Fats: One of the biggest advantages to those who consume fish for example is the plentiful healthy fats which can raise HDL cholesterol levels in the blood.\n\nThe Cons of the Paleo Diet\n\nHowever, not everything about the Paleo diet is great. In fact, it does have some considerable negatives that people will have to consider before taking up the diet.\n\nToo Restrictive: Arguably the biggest issue that most people have with the diet is that it is simply too restrictive and they grow tired of eating essentially the same types of foods. The lack of variety can be difficult to maintain in anyone\u2019s diet.\n\nNo Legumes: Beans and legumes are actually quite healthy and work very well for those who want a protein substitute for the meats in the Paleo diet. However, they are not part of the diet program and are discouraged.\n\nExpense: This may be the biggest drawback as finding all-natural fresh products is generally more expensive that standard diets. The cost of grass-fed beef and salmon caught in the wild are considerable and may be beyond your normal budget for meals.\n\nThe Paleo diet is not the easiest one to follow as it is quite restrictive and can be expensive also. However, for those who are good at cooking up different types of meals out of the relatively limited supply that the Paleo diet provides, it can be quite healthy for you.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Slim Fast has been a diet plan that has been around for more than a generation and many claim to have lost weight while using it. By incorporating snacks, meal bars, and shakes into your daily routine, it becomes a fairly simple method of weight reduction when followed properly. Is it right for you? Let\u2019s take a look at the pros and cons of the Slim Fast diet today.\n\nPros: It is Convenient\n\nThe Slim Fast diet is extremely convenient. You just grab what you need to eat or drink, open it up, and you satisfy a craving. You can take it with you on your commute to work, keep it with you at your cubicle, and stock up at home so you don\u2019t have a bad eating day after a long day at work.\n\nPros: It Is Easy to Use\n\nThere\u2019s no counting calories or guessing food content ratios with the Slim Fast diet. You just purchase the products that you want to consume and then add them to your daily eating routines. There\u2019s no guessing if a new food fits into the plan either. You just use Slim Fast products and eat reasonable meals at appropriate times. That\u2019s why it so easy.\n\nCons: You Eat the Same Thing\n\nIn the old days of Slim Fast, it was really hard to stay on the diet plan because you drank the same shake twice per day, every day, over the course of the diet. Over time, Slim Fast has developed some new flavors and products that allow for some variation, but ultimately it comes down to the same snacks and the same shakes every day.\n\nPros: There Are No Food Restrictions\n\nThe Slim Fast diet is all about caloric restriction. You\u2019re allowed a 500 calorie meal every day, which means you can always have your favorite foods around. This is the only real restriction that there is on the diet, so make sure to have very filling foods in your home so that you can make the most out of this meal. You will likely want to stay away from foods that have a high sodium content, however, to maximize the benefits of this diet.\n\nCons: The Food Is a Turnoff\n\nThe shakes and meal bars aren\u2019t always the best-tasting foods that you\u2019ll ever find. For diet products, they taste reasonably good, but a meal bar that is packed with protein has no comparison to an actual steak. Because the repetitive nature of the diet can quickly begin to turn people off, the diet might be abandoned prematurely and fitness goals might not be achieved.\n\nPros: You\u2019ll Get the Nutrients You Need\n\nThe Slim Fast diet is a nutritionally balanced diet that will give you all of the vitamins and minerals that you need all the time. You won\u2019t have to take any supplements with this diet and the protein content of a snack bar or shake can make you feel full for up to 4 hours, which quells spontaneous snacking quite effectively.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "There are certainly many different types of diet programs out there, but none are quite like the Sensa program. If anything, this may be the easiest weight loss system ever invented given that there are no restrictions to the foods that you want to eat.\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder that the Sensa diet has gained an enormous amount of interest in the past few years for its simple, straightforward approach. For many, this is the type of diet that they have been waiting for because they can eat what they want, just not quite as much as before.\n\nWhat is the Sensa Diet?\n\nBasically, you sprinkle crystals on whatever you are eating which is suppose to help fill you up faster so that you do not consume as much food. The principle of the diet program is quite simple in that you will need to have the Sensa around for any meal that you consume. However, over time you will eat fewer calories because you will stop eating sooner.\n\nThere are several pros to recommend the diet. First and foremost it is dirt simple to follow. All you need to do is carry a shaker of Sensa with you wherever you go. Whenever you order a meal or cook at home, just sprinkle the crystals over your meal and start eating.\n\nAnother advantage is that the ingredients in Sensa are safe to consume and each ingredient is approved by the FDA so it should not cause any side effects. In fact, you might be consuming most, if not all the ingredients on a regular basis in the foods that you do eat.\n\nPlus, the biggest pro of the diet is probably the fact that you can eat what you want. There are no restrictions on your diet. However, it would probably be wise to start eating healthier foods if you want to get the most out of what you consume.\n\nThe fact is Sensa sounds too good to be true because it is in a real sense. If you do not change your diet, you will not start losing weight even if you eat somewhat smaller portions. A good diet program encourages you to choose better foods so that you can start slimming down and losing the excess fat. This one does not.\n\nIn addition, the science behind the diet is not really all that well understood and there are few proper studies that show whether it really works or not. In fact, the product itself may be unnecessary because you can achieve the same results simply by reducing your portions.\n\nFinally, the cost of the product is roughly $60 per month so it is not cheap and if it is not working then you will certainly have wasted your money.\n\nThe interesting thing about Sensa is that it is not weight loss medication, it is simply a filler product designed to get you to eat less by making you feel fuller. Because of the focus of the product, there are no side effects which make it virtually unlike any other diet product.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence to show that this product really works. In fact, you may be better off just cutting down on how much you eat which is the same thing and it\u2019s free.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "The challenge of any diet is to avoid the hunger pains that eventually come up. The goal is to avoid starving yourself without feeling miserable while still being able to lose weight. With Nopalina flax seed being used for weight loss, it becomes possible to feel fuller for longer, which ultimately means being able to restrict more calories. When used properly, not only will it help you eat less, but you\u2019ll avoid constipation that comes with dieting as well.\n\nIn 2023, you can easily find Nopalina flax seeds at many of today\u2019s top retailers. It is also available through online storefronts like Amazon and many of them offer free shipping. Look for authentic Nopalina products that contain high concentrations of Omega-3\u2019s.\n\nWhat Does Nopalina Flax Seed Work?\n\nMost people don\u2019t get enough dietary fiber in the foods that they eat. This means that their digestive tract can\u2019t work as efficiently as it wants to work. The end result is having food become stuck throughout the entire digestive tract and that can eventually lead to massive weight gain. It is believed that the average person has at least 5 pounds of stuck food items somewhere between their colon and their stomach at any given time.\n\nThe added fiber content of Nopalina flax seed helps to create more regularity because the fiber helps to clean out the sides of the digestive tract. It\u2019s easy to use because all you\u2019ve got to do is mix it in with your favorite juice. It\u2019s also a blendable product, which means you can add it to a smoothie and never even know that it is there.\n\nSome might think of Nopalina flax seed as a laxative, but it isn\u2019t really one. It\u2019s more of a fiber supplement than anything else and because it helps to regulate the body, it will help to eliminate some of the issues that many have with digestion, including heartburn.\n\nHow Do People Lose Weight With This Product?\n\nIt\u2019s all about smart eating habits. Nothing is a miracle cure, so don\u2019t expect to shed pounds like crazy when you take Nopalina flax seed. What you will be able to do is regulate the dietary process so that you experience true hunger instead of boredom cravings and other issues that help to create excess body fat.\n\nIf you continue to eat processed foods and high sugar items while taking this supplement, then you won\u2019t experience much in terms of weight loss. If, however, you\u2019re willing to make some dietary changes and incorporate Nopalina flax seed in with your daily eating habits, you can begin to lose up to 2 pounds per week very easily.\n\nIf you\u2019re tired of having your stomach hurt, suffer from heartburn, or are just ready to make a change, then give Nopalina flax seed a try. It will help you feel better and over time, you might just fit into your favorite pants once again.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Do you ever feel like you got hit by a bus after you ate a meal? Even if it was one of your favorite foods, did it make you feel sick to your stomach? There are many foods that create inflammation within the human body after eating them. It is believed that this inflammation leads to premature aging, weight gain, and even sickness. The Zone Diet looks to solve that problem by reducing the inflammation that is caused by eating.\n\nHere are some of the pros and cons of this diet. Find out if it is right for you.\n\nHeart Disease Risks and Weight Loss\n\nThe Zone Diet has a good chance of helping you lose weight. This, in turn, will also help you reduce your risks of developing heart disease in the future. For those who were overweight when they started the Zone Diet and ate it consistently for a year, they were able to lower their weight by 8 pounds and improve their bad cholesterol scores.\n\nThe Control of Diabetes\n\nMany of the foods that are in the Zone Diet have a low glycemic index. This means there are few spikes in blood sugar that must be dealt with by the body and that ultimately means it is easier to control or prevent diabetes.\n\nEndurance Is an Issue\n\nFor those who have highly active lives, the Zone Diet might cause some problems. Not only does weight loss occur, but the amount of stamina that someone has is also reduced. Exhaustion sets in much more quickly and this happens after following the diet for just a week.\n\nIt Can Be Difficult to Follow\n\nThe Zone Diet requires a specific ratio of dietary consumption. It\u2019s 40% carbs, 30% fat, and 30% protein. Finding these foods can be pretty difficult and it can also be very time consuming. Because some days you may only be eating 1,000 calories, it can also create cravings that can reduce the effectiveness of the diet.\n\nIt Is Nutritionally Balanced\n\nThe problem with so many popular diets today is that they don\u2019t provide you with the right amount of nutrients to stay healthy. This creates deficiencies that can then lead to other health problems that are more serious than being overweight! The Zone Diet is very balanced and decreases the user\u2019s risk of being nutritionally deficient in some specific foods.\n\nNo Food Are Actually Banned\n\nYou can eat what you want, but only in the 40/30/30 ratio. You\u2019ll often eat up to 5 times per day with three meals and two snacks. There is generally no health risks associated with this diet, but it can be easy to abandon because it can be rather tedious to put together the structured meals and snacks that are required by the diet.\n\nYou\u2019ll Get More Potassium\n\nDid you know the recommended amount of Potassium is 4,700 milligrams? That\u2019s the equivalent of eating 11 bananas per day. Although you won\u2019t necessarily reach this level on the Zone Diet, you will be eating more fruits and vegetables. You\u2019ll also want to take an Omega-3 supplement while on this diet for better success.\n\nIs the Zone Diet right for you? Speak with your doctor about the pros and cons of your diet and then start taking control of your eating habits today.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Of the many different diets that have appeared in recent years, juicing is one of the simplest and most interesting of the lot. Juicing has actually been around for well over a decade and has been promoted by people such as Jack LaLanne.\n\nThe diet itself does rely on consuming good, healthy, nutritious foods in juice form which should be the standard for any healthy diet program. However, is it the right one for your needs?\n\nWhat is the Juicing Diet?\n\nBasically, the juicing diet is the principle of taking fruits and vegetables and mixing them together in a blender until you come out with a glass of juice. The perceived notion behind the idea is that many people simply do not like to eat their vegetables, so if they are presented in a more palatable form such as a juice drink, then they will be more likely to consume them.\n\nVegetables can be mixed with fruits or left alone to create the juice which many will perceive as a snack and not a meal. In this form, a person can get all the healthy benefits of eating their vegetables without having to consume them in their original form.\n\nThe Pros of the Juicing Diet\n\nThere is little doubt that juicing is a more pleasant way to eat your vegetables. People who are not real fans of vegetables may be more likely to consume them in this form. Another benefit is the many healthy benefits of drinking your vegetables in a concentrated form can be very healthy for the body.\n\nFresh juice is not only healthy as it is also an energizing drink that can act as a great \u201cpick me up\u201d for the middle of the afternoon. It might even be considered a good meal replacement if you are someone who eats way too many calories during the day. Not to mention that there is hardly any fat, bad carbohydrates or processed sugar in vegetable juice.\n\nThe Cons of the Juicing Diet\n\nDespite the many positive points, juicing is a really expensive way to consume your vegetables. It takes more vegetables and fruits on average to create the juice than it would be to simply eat them in their raw form. So, you will have to add considerably to your food budget in order to go on the juicing diet.\n\nAnother issue is that juicing is simply not as satisfying as eating your vegetables and you may wind up consuming even more calories because of your desire to eat more foods rather than just drinking the juice. In other words, you may wind up gaining weight instead of shedding the unwanted pounds.\n\nFinally, a lot of the dietary fiber that is an important part of fruits and vegetables gets lost when you press the juice to make your drink.\n\nThere are certainly advantages to the juicing diet, especially for those who have trouble eating their vegetables. However, this form of dieting may be best when complimented by eating healthy meals such as lean meats and other products that can provide much needed protein and calcium.\n\nAs a drink to compliment your dinner, the juicing diet may work the best in this form for most people who want to eat healthy and shed the excess pounds.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss-se/using-triphala-churna-for-weight-loss/",
    "content": "If you take a look at the average weight loss plan, you\u2019ll notice that there is an emphasis on watching how many calories are stored every day. Calorie counts are managed through careful nutritional choices and an increase in daily exercise. What if weight loss could be achieved without worrying about how much dietary fat is eaten or how long a walk on the treadmill happens to be?\n\nThat\u2019s a possibility thanks to Triphala Churna.\n\nHow Many Processed Foods Have You Eaten?\n\nThe human digestive system is an amazing marvel of nature, but it isn\u2019t necessarily perfect. It doesn\u2019t always perfectly extract the nutrients of the foods that are being eaten. Normally this creates waste that is eliminated from the body, but not 100% of the time. There tends to be a little bit leftover that remains within the digestive tract.\n\nThis is especially true when processed foods are eaten.\n\nThe digestive system has a hard time with processed foods. They are often so compact that even with heavy stomach acids, it is nearly impossible to properly digest the food properly. This creates the conditions for compacted waste. When that happens, stuff tends to get stuck. The average person actually has up to 5 pounds of stuck waste in their body at any given time. For those eating processed foods regularly, the amount of stuck food could be tripled.\n\nThis is where Triphala Churna can help. It encourages the body to cleanse itself, freeing it of the heavy, compacted wastes that don\u2019t want to be processed. In return, your body will be able to absorb more vitamins and minerals because there are fewer blockages that prevent this from happening.\n\nHow Should Triphala Churna Be Taken?\n\nThe most common way this weight loss encourager is taken is through hot or iced tea. The reason behind this is that many believe it is important to taste the Triphala Churna so that you can track personal results. When people first start drinking the tea, it tastes very bitter and isn\u2019t something you\u2019d willingly drink again. Over time, however, the bitterness begins to fade. The theory is that when the bitterness is gone, the stuck-on processed foods will be gone as well.\n\nTo get the most out of Triphala Churna, consider getting this supplement in its powder form and stir it into hot tea that is seeping. This will allow the nutrients to be included in the tea and then it can be consumed.

    "content": "The Atkins Diet has been one of the more popular diets developed over the past half century and today people around the world use this diet to lose excess fat. While the success rate for the diet has certainly been noted, so have the shortcomings as well. For many, it is a diet that offers a great number of restrictions, but does come with many benefits as well. Like any restrictive diet program, this particular diet has a number of pros and cons that will need to be considered before you decide to follow the plan.\n\nThe Pros of the Atkins Diet\n\n1. Eliminate Refined Carbohydrates One of the biggest reasons that people gain weight is their consumption of refined carbohydrates, such as you would find in white bread and cakes. The Adkins diet however eliminates all such carbs from the diet. Because so many gain and retain their excess weight because of these carbs, not eating them may cause a quick shedding of fat from the body.\n\n2. Improved Cholesterol Levels Although it does seem counter-intuitive given all the meat that is consumed, dieters will actually improve their cholesterol levels when on this diet despite the high levels of fat that is consumed. Obviously, exercise is an important part of helping to keep the cholesterol down, but this diet does manage to lower the \u201cbad\u201d or LDL cholesterol levels.\n\n3. Men Prefer It Many men enjoy eating this meat-oriented diet as part of their meals. It is something that men have grown accustomed to when growing up and this only accentuates the effectiveness of staying on this diet program.\n\n4. Easy to Adjust Carbohydrate Levels Because of the very low intake of bad carbohydrates, it is really easy for dieters to find the right levels of carbohydrates that suits them best in this diet program.\n\nThe Cons of the Atkins Diet\n\n1. Not Enough Carbs Because of the lack of carbohydrates, the body is forced into ketosis which places a heavy burden on the kidneys. The addition of complex carbohydrates in some form is needed to offset the effects of ketosis.\n\n2. Vitamin Deficiency Because you are not eating enough fruits, vegetables and whole grains, your body will suffer from the lack of vitamins. However, this can be supplied with vitamin supplements on a daily basis.\n\n3. Side Effects Although the severe side effects from the diet are rare, many dieters do suffer from dehydration, constipation and halitosis which can be quite annoying. Arguably the worst aspect of the diet is when it is finished, dieters who go back to eating the carbs will quickly gain back the weight and probably even more. For those who want to keep the weight off for good, this is not the best diet program for the job.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "One of the great debates when it comes to healthy foods is whether high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is actually better for you than natural sugars. There are certainly advocates on both sides of the argument, but the truth is that the debate has gone on for decades since the introduction of HFCS.\n\nEssentially, the ones who promote HFCS will state that since it comes from corn that it is a natural product and just as good as sugar without some of the issues associated with that product. However, the other side claims that sugar is sugar when it is processed no matter the source and that it has the same effects.\n\nWhat is true is that there are both positive and negative effects from using HFCS in your diet over natural sugar.\n\nThe Pros of High Fructose Corn Syrup\n\nThere are a number of advantages to using HFCS in your diet as opposed to processed sugar. Keep in mind that this is not about natural sugar that you find in many fruits and vegetables which is considered to be superior to its processed counterparts.\n\nSweeter Foods: While research has shown roughly the same level of sweetness as provided by HFCS to the same amount of processed sugar, consumers seem to prefer HFCS. This may be due to the fact that it tastes sweeter than processed sugar in many different types of foods and beverages.\n\nLonger Life: HFCS last longer in foods and beverages compared to its sugar counterparts, making it a better preservative so that the food or beverage itself lasts longer on the shelf. For many food manufacturers as well as consumers who store food at home, this is an important consideration.\n\nLess Expensive: Compared to actual sugar, HFCS is less expensive overall due to the current manufacturing process. It\u2019s one reason why HFCS consumption has increased over the years when compared to sugars from cane and beets.\n\nThe Cons of High Fructose Corn Syrup\n\nHowever, despite all the advantages that high fructose corn syrup brings, there are considerable disadvantages as well.\n\nIncrease in Cholesterol & Fat: No matter its form, sugar is a source of energy that the body will use and when there is too much it stores the remainder as fat. This process means that you will produce more LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol as well.\n\nLess Satiation of Hunger: While HFCS makes food taste sweeter, the hunger is not as satisfied as it were with sugar from beets or cane. This means that people stay satisfied for shorter periods of time and eat more frequently.\n\nPesticides: Since HFCS comes from corn, farmers often use pesticides to help them grow the product more rapidly as well as keep away the insects and pests. The result is that the by-product may be less healthy than sugar which comes from cane or beets which generally do not need the amount of pesticides that corn requires.\n\nOverall, high fructose corn syrup has its disadvantages, but is so prevalent that people who are dieting must take into account where it is present so that they can correctly plan their meals so they can lose weight.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "There are certainly many different diets that have come to prominence in the past decade with people around the world looking for ways to lose weight. One of the most interesting is the HCG Diet which has been growing steadily in recent years which promises to help people lose a considerable amount of weight in a short period of time.\n\nWhat is the HCG Diet?\n\nThe Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) is a hormone that is produced in human through the pituitary gland. This particular hormone causes the body to burn away the fat at a faster rate than normal in particular when a person is consuming a low calorie diet. So, instead of burning away bone mass or muscle tissue when eating so few calories, the body will instead focus on the fat cells first.\n\nThe diet injects the HCG hormone into the body while the person follows a strict, low calorie diet. This diet promises to help people lose up to a pound of fat per day thanks to the calorie restriction and the burning of the fat. The HCG is administered in clinics around the country and the overall process has been heavily promoted in recent years.\n\nIdeal for Short Period Weight Loss: Essentially, this may be the ideal diet for those who need to lose five to ten pounds in a short period of time. While injections are considered the best form of administering the HCG, it can also be done in drop or pill form which avoids the pain of needles.\n\nThe overall emphasis on the diet is to help a person lose weight really fast in a short period of time, so someone who needs to lose up to ten pounds can really benefit from using this form of weight loss as it goes after the fat and not the bone mass or muscle tissue.\n\nThere are a number of reasons to avoid this diet if you have more than a few pounds to lose, particularly if you are subject to the health risk that the calorie restriction and rapid weight loss has on the body itself.\n\nNot Approved by the FDA: The Food and Drug Administration has approved quite a few diets, but not this one because the calorie restriction is simply too much for most people to endure. At a mere 500 calories per day, that is essentially one meal which is simply not enough energy for most people to meet their needs for the day.\n\nLack of Effectiveness: Despite all the claims, there appears to be very little evidence that the HCG actually helps the body burn the fat away instead of the bone or muscle tissue. So, the effectiveness of the diet, particularly for those who have more weight to lose may be just a waste of money.\n\nLittle Support: With no exercise regimen as part of the diet process, there is no real way to make the long term effects of the diet stick for those who do manage to lose the weight. Without building up lean muscle mass, the weight that is lost will quickly be put back on when the dieting stops.\n\nOverall, the HCG Diet is not one that promises long term, effective results and may actually do more harm than good to the body.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "The vegan or vegetarian diet has been promoted in recent years as being healthier than traditional diets that include meats. For many decades, vegan diets have appealed to those who want to refrain from consuming foods derived from animals, poultry and fish. However, more people are now considering the virtues of going totally vegetarian in their diet for health reasons.\n\nIs the vegan diet really better for your body than one that includes meats? While there is no clear answer, there are certainly advantages and disadvantages to consuming a vegan only diet.\n\nThe Pros of a Vegan Diet\n\nBetter Control in Dieting Effort: One of the biggest issues with diets that are restrictive is that people will grow tired of them after a while and revert back to their normal eating habits. However, those who choose the vegan diet were better able to control their eating habits thanks to the fact that most vegan foods take a little longer to consume which slows down the process of eating. This means that vegans tend to be more aware of what is going in their mouths while cutting down on impulse eating habits.\n\nLower Blood Pressure: In 2009, the American Dietetic Association concluded that eating a vegan diet helped lower the risk of dying from ischemic heart disease. This is because a vegan diet is far lower in LDL cholesterol that promotes higher blood pressure and a greater risk of buildup in the arteries and veins. The report showed a lowering of blood pressure as well as less risk of developing Type 2 diabetes as compared to those who consumed meat.\n\nLower Cholesterol Level: There have been studies showing vegan diets lower LDL cholesterol as compared to those who consumed meat. Those suffering from Type 2 Diabetes were able to lower their LDL levels by upwards of 21%, although the American Dietetic Association\u2019s study only showed a 9% drop. Still, the net effect was a drop in LDL levels across different studies.\n\nThe Cons of a Vegan Diet\n\nFewer Vitamins and Minerals: Vegan diets are generally devoid of important vitamins and minerals such as B12, D and calcium. They can consume vitamin and mineral supplements as a response to not getting it from the foods that they eat, but it does add more to the food budget.\n\nFewer Choices: It can be difficult for vegans to eat at restaurants as many of the menu choices involve meat or meat products of some type. This means that vegans must be careful about what they consume when they go out to eat.\n\nBig Changes: Going on a vegan diet can be difficult for many because it represents so many changes to their eating habits. Making such a switch may be a bit too much for some people to make, especially if they love eating meat products.\n\nIn addition, eating a vegan diet might interfere with certain treatments of medical conditions such as diabetes or osteoporosis which means that you should consult with your physician before switching to a vegan die. Otherwise, you might exacerbate the medical condition that you are suffering from while going vegan.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "When it comes to eating better and maintaining your natural weight, there are many diet programs on the market that make some powerful promises. However, one of the most common diets is based not only on losing weight, but also on avoiding consuming any animal or animal-related products. Vegetarianism has been around for many decades and promoted as one of the healthiest ways to eat, especially for those looking to lose weight.\n\nBut does it really live up to all of its promises? Here are the pros and cons of going vegetarian when it comes to your daily eating habits.\n\nThe Pros of Vegetarianism\n\nLose Weight: The essence of the vegetarian diet of fruits, vegetables and legumes is very low in saturated fats, the type that tends to pack on the pounds. In fact, it\u2019s possible to eat filling meals and actually lose weight thanks to the fat-burning qualities of some of the fruits and vegetables that are found in vegetarian meals.\n\nBetter Heart Health: Studies have shown that vegetarian diets are good for the heart as they include plenty of potassium, fruits, legumes and whole grains which are very low in saturated fats. In addition, they are also helpful to blood pressure and in lowering LDL or bad cholesterol. This means that consuming a healthy amount of fruits, vegetables and legumes will help bring out healthier benefits.\n\nHigh in Fiber: Fiber offers many benefits to the body that can be most helpful when it comes to better digestion, lowering the amount of cholesterol in the body and even improving heart health. For those who consume plenty of fiber during the day, this can also help keep down hunger cravings and prevent excessive snacking.\n\nFewer Processed Foods: By consuming more unprocessed foods, your body will get the nutrition it needs without having the added sugars and preservatives that pack on the pounds. In fact, snacking by eating an apple or carrots can provide plenty of nutrition without providing the excess fat or carbohydrates that will often add pounds to the frame.\n\nThe Cons of Vegetarianism\n\nLack of Protein: The vegetarian diet has very few sources of protein apart from certain legumes or beans which would need to be a required part of the diet in order to help maintain muscle mass.\n\nLack of Calcium, Iron and Zinc: Plant food does not generally supply the required amounts of these minerals to the body which would mean having to go more towards supplements in order to make up the difference.\n\nLack of Riboflavin: While consuming milk would help balance out the need for riboflavin, a vegetarian who does not want to consume any animal-produced product can turn to soy, yogurt, broccoli or bananas to have enough riboflavin.\n\nOverall, sticking to a vegetarian diet does offer some complications in the lack of certain vitamins, minerals, proteins and riboflavin that must be made up for with supplements or consuming certain animal-related products. For those who can live without meat, the vegetarian diet does offers certain benefits that will help you lower your weight and live healthy.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

The good news is after 25 years of consulting, I have a great \u201cblue-print\u201d for losing stubborn fat \u2026 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to share with you today.\n\nThe \u201cGallbladder Removal\u201d Challenge\n\nLosing weight is difficult as it is, but it\u2019s an even bigger challenge when you\u2019ve had your gallbladder removed. And the reason is due to food digestion, as well as your change in hormones.\n\nSo over the years I\u2019ve noticed a couple of reasons why people have gained unwanted weight/fat after they\u2019ve had their gallbladder removed.\n\nEating More Fatty Foods\n\nThe function of the gallbladder is to hold bile from the liver until it is needed to help metabolize fats in the intestine. When the gallbladder isn\u2019t working correctly or is infected, it can cause pain when stimulated to secrete the bile, especially when you eat fatty foods.\n\nSo what happens is most people who have gallbladder problems, simply eat LESS food, especially fatty foods because it hurts too much.\n\nBecause of this pain, people end up eating LESS food and this causes weight loss over time\u2026\n\nBUT\u2026 when the gallbladder is removed, the pain of eating these fatty foods is ALSO removed and thus, people are able to finally eat a \u201cnormal\u201d diet again without pain.\n\nSo most people gain weight because now they can enjoy eating more fatty foods because the pain is now gone!\n\nChange In Hormones & Digestion\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after gallbladder surgery, your body metabolizes fat differently, cortisol and insulin levels are elevated and this also leads to fat gain due to a change in your hormones and lack of proper digestion.\n\nAnd this is a big long-term factor.\n\nIt\u2019s All About The Hormones\n\nAs you can see, hormones really do control everything. Throw in aging and now things get a bit more challenging.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to give you some great suggestions which will help improve your digestion and maximize your fat loss. But we\u2019ll ALSO be optimizing your fat burning hormones \u2013 which means a faster metabolism, more energy and healthier fat loss \u2013 especially in those stubborn fat areas.\n\nSo, don\u2019t worry \u2013 it\u2019s not your fault. There is hope, I\u2019ve got the solution and you CAN do it!\n\nBefore Getting Started\n\nSo before I reveal some \"shortcuts\" to stripping off that ugly fat, I'd like to get a couple things out of the way:\n\nNO Drugs - Even though there are specific drugs you can take that'll speed up the fat loss, unfortunately they're loaded with side-effects and later, you'll eventually gain all the weight back when you get off of the drug. But, don't worry... I'll show you an all-natural solution that works great, with fast results.\n\nNO \"Weight Loss\" - The other thing is you want to lose FAT, not just \"weight\", which is usually valuable muscle loss. Unfortunately, most weight loss programs cause the wrong type of weight loss. Today I'll show you how to decrease the inches in those stubborn areas like your belly, arms, hips and legs for the ladies.\n\nOkay, so let's get started with the...\n\n3 Best Methods To Lose Fat Quickly\n\nThere are really 3 main keys to healthy, long-term fat loss and I'm going to simplify it for you.\n\nDiet - this is one of the most important, since you can easily consume more calories than you can burn.\n\nExercise - by doing the right form of exercise you'll burn more calories, which will allow you to eat more food or not diet as hard.\n\nSupplements - the right kind will improve your \"fat burning genes\" by up-regulating key fat burning hormones, which means faster fat loss.\n\nThe most important aspect of fat loss is your diet because you can easily consume MORE calories than you can burn. It's just so easy and that's why we have to watch what you eat. So, here are a few \"fast result\" diet tips.\n\nLet's first start with the things you should NOT do because these will quickly sabotage any weight loss goals you'll ever have.\n\nDo NOT Eat Carbohydrates I started with the hardest one, but that's because most carbohydrates (grains, breads, pastas, rice, etc.) are very calorie dense and make you retain lots of water weight. Another major problem is that they easily convert to fat due to the high blood sugar response. IF you're going to have them, do so only after an exercise session.\n\nDo NOT Drink Your Calories There is no point in drinking any calories since that takes seconds to consume. This means no soda, fruit juice, blended coffee drinks or protein shakes and smoothies. Oh yeah, no alcohol either =(\n\nDo NOT Eat Sauces This is easier for most people, but don't consume any sauces, syrups, salad dressings, etc. Too calorie dense and either loaded with sugar and/or fats. Instead, have lemon juice and vinegar on your salad.\n\nLet's move on to the things you CAN and should do...\n\nDO Eat Carbohydrates Okay, I know I just told you not to, but carbs are very good for your metabolism because they improve your thyroid production. You just need to eat the right kinds and that's primarily from unlimited vegetables, some fruits, legumes and occasionally some sweet potatoes if you want a \"treat\".\n\nDO Drink Unlimited water and green tea. Mix in lemon juice and sweeten with natural Stevia and you have a great tasting and healthy drink that will also curb your appetite.\n\nDO Eat Protein You should have some protein, but limit it to fish, chicken and lean meats. No more than 4 oz daily and do NOT fry the meats or cook with oils.\n\nThe second most important formula for fat loss success is exercise.\n\nIdeally you should do BOTH aerobic AND anaerobic exercise.\n\nThis means cardiovascular - like walking, running, treadmill, etc.\n\nAnd also lifting weights to increase muscle mass - using free weights, machines and cables. In fact, the weight lifting is more important for FAT loss because the extra muscle burns fat all day long and helps give shape to your body.\n\nYou may lose less \"weight\" on the scale because of the extra muscle size, but you'll lose more UGLY FAT in those stubborn areas, which matters most.\n\nAnyway, just try to do something daily. For faster results, try exercising 2x daily.\n\nFor example, you can walk in the morning for 20-30 minutes and do weights in the afternoon for 20-30 minutes. This is the BEST case scenario... I wouldn't expect you to start here, unless you're super motivated or you want faster results.\n\nBut just try to do a minimum of 20-30 minutes, 3x weekly of any form of exercise to begin with.\n\nTaking specific herbs, vitamins and minerals that are scientifically proven to help lose \"weight\" is useful if you want to:\n\nspeed up your fat loss results (especially stubborn fat areas)\n\nincrease your metabolism (like when you were younger)\n\nreduce your appetite (especially for sugars and carbohydrates)\n\nWe all know of people who can eat whatever they want, not exercise and they don't really gain much weight. This has to do with genetics and hormones.\n\nThis is why when women are menstruating or they're menopausal, they gain weight - in all the wrong places - HORMONES.\n\nLean Optimizer\u2122 helps promote healthy fat burning hormones and enzymes, naturally.\n\nSummary & Bottom Line\n\nYou need to eat better and exercise daily - these should be your primary goals.\n\nBy utilizing Lean Optimizer with the right diet and exercise program, means healthy fat loss, for long-term results.\n\nOne major reason Lean Optimizer\u2122 is better than other options is because it's doctor formulated and scientifically tested to work.\n\nThe feedback has been is really great and since the product has been around for 22+ years, you know it works!\n\nAnyways, take a look Lean Optimizer\u2122 ... how it works, benefits, reviews, ingredients, etc...",

    "content": "There is little doubt that choosing to undergo hormone replacement therapy can be a difficult decision, especially in light of the potential side effects as well as the overall cost. However, for many women who undergo the treatments, they believe that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages even though a certain percentage still experience unwanted side effects of the treatment.\n\nWith new studies being performed and the news about this form of treatment seeming to shift back and forth on a regular basis, it is understandable that many women are concerned about this form of treatment.\n\nThe Pros of Hormone Replacement Therapy\n\nFirst and foremost, while there is still considerable debate about the risks and potential side effects, there is little doubt that this treatment does offer significant help in fighting the symptoms of osteoporosis and menopause. Even the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recognized these benefits in spite of some of the setbacks that this therapy might bring to certain patients.\n\nHormone replacement therapy is generally considered to be the best treatment for severe symptoms of menopause, particularly in the pre and postmenopausal state. As a preventative measure, this particular treatment is also considered highly effective in preventing osteoporosis as well. In particular for women who cannot take traditional medicines to protect the health of their bones.\n\nThe Cons of Hormone Replacement Therapy\n\nAs effective as hormone replacement therapy is, there are some unwanted side effects that may affect the health of women when undergoing the treatment.\n\nIncreased Risk of Heart Attack and Cancer: There is a slight increase that occurs when undergoing the therapy. However, studies have shown that the risks are decreased if both estrogen and progesterone are used in the therapy or if the woman has undergone a hysterectomy. However, women who have a family history of heart attack, stroke and cancer should be wary of the risk that hormone replacement therapy offers even if they are only slight.\n\nThe same risks apply when using the treatment for osteoporosis, however the FDA recommends that hormone replacement therapy should not be used just for the treatment of the bone disease alone. There are doctors who take exception to this general rule depending on the health and particular condition of the patient, but overall most women who have this form of therapy for osteoporosis are also being treated for menopausal symptoms as well.\n\nHormone replacement therapy is not the panacea that it was once thought to be a couple of decades ago. Back then, it was believed it could treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dementia and other conditions which have now proven to be ineffective. However, it is still very effective when fighting the severe symptoms of menopause, particular both just before and after the condition has passed. This has led to welcome relief for women around the world.\n\nDespite the risks, hormone replacement therapy will continue to be used as one of the primary treatment for menopause symptoms and osteoporosis for the foreseeable future. Be sure to take to your doctor about the risks that this form of treatment does carry.",

    "content": "There is a new emphasis on probiotics when it comes to advertising certain foods in the grocery store. Probiotics are basically friendly microorganism that consists of mostly bacteria although some yeast products hold them as well. Today, you can find them in many yogurts, granola bars and chocolates and while they seem like a new trend, they have actually been around for well over a century.\n\nWhile probiotics are considered very healthy for the digestive system, are they right for your particular needs? The truth is that there are positives and potential negatives in adding probiotics to your diet.\n\nThe most obvious advantage to consuming probiotics on a regular basis is how they impact the digestive system. Having plenty of probiotics in the gut provides for the better consumption and passage of food through the digestive tract. However, there are other positive benefits that probiotics have as well.\n\nPrevent Cancer: A study by BMC Surgery in 2012 indicated that probiotics may actually help lower the chances for contracting colorectal cancer. Further studies will be needed in order to see the full effects.\n\nReduction of Oral Diseases: There has been some research indicated that probiotic organisms have a positive effect in preventing the following oral conditions:\n\n1. Cavities 2. Periodontal Disease 3. Halitosis and Other Oral Diseases\n\nHowever, the studies are considered incomplete and further research must be performed in order to confirm or deny its effects.\n\nBlood Pressure: Studies have shown that probiotics may have a positive effect on blood pressure. In fact, those who have elevated levels of blood pressure may benefit the most when consuming probiotics on a daily basis.\n\nPrevent Rheumatoid Arthritis: One study conducted in 2013 showed a connection between having one dominant type of bacteria in the digestive tract and contracting rheumatoid arthritis. Consuming probiotics would prevent such an overgrowth of one form of bacteria.\n\nThere are some downsides for certain individuals who may feel some abdominal discomfort, bloating or excessive gas from consuming probiotics. However, these individuals are mostly children and the elderly who have less robust immune systems as compared to adults. Plus, such symptoms are usually temporary and will fade over time as the body gets used to consuming more of these microorganisms.\n\nHowever, if such symptoms persist you can always switch to another type of probiotic to see if it has the same effects. In some cases, you might start off by only eating a little and gauging the effects that way so you are not too distressed if your body has issues.\n\nArguably the biggest disadvantage is that probiotics are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which means that you might not get what is generally supposed to be good for you. There are probiotics that have little positive effects as compared to others, so you will have to be a little careful in what you decide to pick.\n\nOverall, probiotics have generally positive effects on the digestive system which can lead to feeling better and even preventing certain types of diseases.",

    "content": "For those who suffer from Crohn\u2019s Disease, there are only a few medications that are recommended for controlling this condition. Humira and Remicade are the most popular and each of them has their proponents when it come their effectiveness.\n\nBoth drugs are considered to be anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy or TNF with only a few differences between each drug. Each drug has enjoyed a considerable amount of success when it comes to treating the effects of Crohn\u2019s Disease. Plus, both drugs enjoy a healthy fan base from those who swear by the results. It does seem that barring any unusual side effects, each drug has roughly the same effect over time which makes them quite popular.\n\nInterestingly enough, so far there has not been a study which directly compared the two drugs. But which one is better when it comes to treating Crohn\u2019s Disease and the other conditions which it is prescribed? The answer will depend in part on your particular condition and your reaction to each drug.\n\nRemicade was first developed and approved for use against Crohn\u2019s Disease back in 1998. It is a combination of a mouse and human antibodies that works to stall the disease in its tracks. Humira is very similar to Remicade in terms of its ingredients, but it does not have the mouse antibody inside.\n\nThe truth is that both drugs are very similar in their makeup save for the mouse protein that is found in Remicade. The addition of the mouse protein has resulted in a few people having an allergic reaction, something that is not present in Humira. However, the number of people who are allergic is a small one, so the differences are rather minimal after that.\n\nThere is also a difference in how each drug is administered. Remicade must be infused every 6 to 8 weeks while Humira only requires a shot every 2 weeks. When you consider the time it takes for the infusion process, many people prefer Humira because the shots take up far less time. In this manner, Humira does offer an advantage for those who have less time to treat their condition.\n\nThe studies that have been performed on both drugs indicate that Humira is not quite as effective as Remicade in the early stages, but after one year both drugs have pretty much the same effect. There are indications that certain people may build up immunity to Remicade which makes it less effective over time, but these studies are still in the early stages. Plus, many doctors seem to prefer Remicade because it has been on the market longer and the results are easier to gauge which makes adjustments simpler to perform.\n\nHowever, it must be stated that both drugs are very effective at what they do with the differences themselves being rather minimal. What also can be said is that many patients who have tried both seem to have issues with one, but not the other despite the fact that both are nearly identical.",

    "content": "When it comes to those suffering from gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or other conditions where the stomach acid reaches the esophagus and causes tissue damage and pain, there are over the counter medications that can provide relief. Two of the most popular are Nexium and Omeprazole. Each of these drugs is based on the same basic principle of acid reduction in the stomach so that the chances of reflux are greatly reduced.\n\nUsing Nexium and Omeprazole\n\nBoth Nexium and Omeprazole are based on what is known as proton pump inhibitors which basically means that the pumps in the stomach which produce the acid are reduced so that less of it is created when eating meals. In addition, both of these medications are highly popular and today help millions of people who suffer from frequent cases of heartburn.\n\nSince 1981, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have been used to help people who suffer from GERD and other conditions where the stomach creates too much acid. However, it must be noted that stomach acid itself is excellent for digestion and not having enough will make food harder to digest properly. So, the use of PPI medications should be limited to those who have frequent heartburn while people who only suffer from occasional bouts should take tablets that provide immediate relief from stomach acid which may find its way up to the esophagus.\n\nHow Nexium and Omeprazole are Similar\n\nThe similarities between the two medications are such that they are virtually identical in nature. Not only are the based on the same principle, they are also mostly identical in terms of their chemical makeup. This means that there are virtually no differences in taking one over the other.\n\nEach drug should be taken about a half-hour before a meal so that they can start to inhibit the production of stomach acid before it starts with the introduction of food. In addition, it does take at least a week before the full effect of each drug will be felt. This is because of the amount of time needed for the proton pumps to start becoming inhibited consistently over the course of the treatment.\n\nIn the end, both types of medications will have a similar effect on the stomach and thus help those who suffer from GERD or other forms of stomach distress.\n\nHow Nexium and Omeprazole are Different\n\nAlthough virtually alike, there are a few minor differences between both medications that start with Nexium being slightly more effective than Omeprazole when it comes to controlling the symptoms of GERD over time. In addition, the same studies have shown that Nexium works slightly faster than Omeprazole in terms of shutting down the proton pumps in the stomach. However, after a week has passed both drugs work about the same.\n\nUntil mid-2014, Nexium was only available as a prescription which made it far more expensive than Omeprazole, but that has now changed as both drugs are available over the counter. The bottom line is that both drugs work equally well at controlling the symptoms of GERD and other acid-reflux situations, so they are both excellent choices.",

    "content": "Plant sterols and stanols are actually cousins of cholesterol, but serve to lower the amount in your bloodstream. By eating foods that are rich in plant sterols, you can lower your cholesterol over time if you combine it with proper exercise and a healthy diet.\n\nThe consumption of plant sterols are mostly for those with moderately high amounts of cholesterol in their systems as this is a safe, natural way to lower the levels in your body. For those who have high amounts of cholesterol, other treatments may be needed in order to bring them under control.\n\nThere are a number of different foods that contain plant sterols that you can incorporate into your diet. Generally speaking, you should eat a mixture of these foods for maximum impact and combine them with a diet that is rich is soluble fiber, low in sugar and fats which can contribute to having less cholesterol in your bloodstream.\n\nToday, many foods are now fortified by sterols and stanols which mean that even if they do not possess them naturally, they are still fortified with them so that you can benefit from the results. Such fortified food products include the following:\n\nRemember to look for the labels that should highlight their sterol and stanol count so that you can benefit from consuming such foods. However, it is important to remember that many of these foods also contain other substances as well which can actually contribute to your weight, such as chocolate so be sure to consume them in moderate amounts.\n\nHow to Plant Sterols Work?\n\nBasically, when you consume plant sterols, they will actually \u201cgum up\u201d the works in your body that would otherwise absorb cholesterol from foods. However, there are two different types of cholesterol, the LDL which is the \u201cbad\u201d form in the bloodstream and the HDL which is the \u201cgood\u201d form. The sterols will actually help clear away the LDL while leaving the HDL for proper liver function.\n\nConsuming just two grams of sterols or stanols each day can lower the LDL cholesterol in your body by roughly 10% in total. While that may not sound all that impressive, just lowering the LDL by 10% may reduce the chances of a heart attack by up to 20%.\n\nThe effect of sterols and stanols on the body that provide no noticeable side effects when taken in the proper amounts has led the FDA to green light a number of foods to have this natural product to fortify. This means that a great number of foods will be augmented by plant sterols and stanols which will help lower the LDL cholesterol in the body when combined with a healthy diet and exercise program.\n\nFor those who have high cholesterol counts in their body, consuming more plant sterols and stanols can significantly lower the amount in the bloodstream which can in turn create a lower chance of heart attack.\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Growing up, when I would visit my grandparents\u2019 home, I would always see soaked almonds in water. I asked them why they soak them and they said, \u201cso you can peel the skin.\u201d\n\nI then asked, \u201cwhy do you want to peel the skin?\u201d and their response was \u201cbecause it\u2019s healthier for you, it\u2019s easier to digest.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t make sense to me at the time. But they were right, the digestion was easier.\n\nHowever, I would still consume raw almonds that were not soaked because it was just easier and faster.\n\nBut, I was \u201cyoung and dumb\u201d and later research clearly shows that soaked almonds and nuts, are healthier for you.\n\nThis is because the brown peel of almonds contains tannin which inhibits nutrient absorption. Once you soak almonds the peel comes off easily and allows the nut to release all nutrients.\n\nAdditionally, nuts, in general, have phytic acid, which is also found in grains and legumes. Just as with grains and legumes, soaking nuts is essential for proper digestions.\n\nWhen eating nuts that haven\u2019t been soaked, the phytic acid binds to minerals in the gastrointestinal tract and can not be absorbed in the intestine, which can lead to mineral deficiencies.\n\nBy soaking, you are breaking down the phytic acid so it can be absorbed properly. In fact, many of the older cultures \u2013 Middle Eastern, Greek, and Asians will regularly soak grains, nuts, and legumes in water, overnight.\n\nThey figured this out thousands of years ago and modern science has confirmed the benefits.\n\nNuts also have high amounts of enzyme inhibitors. This is another reason why unsoaked nuts are hard to digest. Soaking nuts can neutralize the enzymes allowing for proper digestion.\n\nIt\u2019s really very simple. Just put your raw almonds in a bowl. Pour water on them until the almonds are covered. And you can add in some salt to the water, which will help neutralize the enzymes.\n\nDo this overnight or at least 8 hours. Then, just peel the skin with your fingernails and enjoy.\n\nAnd you can do this with other nuts \u2014 pecans, walnuts, and hazelnuts.\n\nYou can just leave the nuts in the water for a couple of days. Then just replace the old salt water with a fresh one every 2-3 days.\n\nThe end result is better absorption of all nutrients and improved digestion as well.",

I think protein powders should be limited to maybe just once a day or if you\u2019re in a rush.\n\nHowever, there is an ideal time to have your whey protein and that\u2019s around your workout.\n\nFor example, I mix about 30 grams of whey isolate + 30 grams of highly branched cyclic dextrin + 1 teaspoon of MCT oil containing only caprylic acid, C8.\n\nI have about 1/3rd of it 30 min before my workout, 1/3rd of it halfway through my workout, and the final 1/3rd after my last set when I\u2019m done with the workout.\n\nThis fuels my workout, allowing me to do more sets, without burning out, and also gives me a better pump.\n\nAnd this is because the whey isolate and highly branched cyclic dextrin are both fast-acting and easy to digest. No bloat or gas.\n\nThey get into your bloodstream quickly and also raise insulin levels \u2013 which I want during my training to help lower cortisol levels and thus, elevate testosterone.\n\nHowever, because I\u2019m only having a little bit at a time and not all at once, there isn\u2019t a massive insulin spike and thus, no crash either.\n\nThe whey isolate is high in BCAA and gives 5 grams worth, which is great for muscle building and cortisol reduction.\n\nAnd the MCT oil, using only the C8, caprylic acid form, gives me energy and focus because of the ketones. It\u2019s a mild effect, but I do notice it. It has a lot of health benefits as well.\n\nPlus, the C8 version is much easier on the stomach and causes me no discomfort \u2013 while other MCT oils do \u2013 which contain C10 and C12. However, I still only take 1 teaspoon at a time, not much more. I may take another teaspoon in the morning when I wake up.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve found this to be the best way to build more muscle, lose fat, and improve your body composition.\n\nYou can also add in a teaspoon of glutamine and creatine as well into this drink and you\u2019ll further maximize your muscle-building workouts.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s all about hormones and optimizing them.",

And these two are commonly confused and used interchangeably. The American Bison is native to North and South America and Europe, while buffalos are native to Africa and Asia.\n\nAs you can see in this picture, the difference between the two \u2026 the bison has a hairier face and smaller horns. Most people will have access to bison, especially in the US.\n\nIf you know me, I like to save you time and get right to the facts and keep it simple. So let\u2019s get started.\n\nI like bison much better than beef (cow) because:\n\nLess fat than beef and it has more muscle-building, fat-burning, CLA fat (conjugated Linoleic acid).\n\nThey are NEVER administered antibiotics or hormones. In fact, it\u2019s illegal\u2026 while most beef is unless it is USDA organic.\n\nThey\u2019re pasture-raised, free-range, and graze freely. While most beef is raised in feedlots. Even the \u201cfree-range\u201d ones don\u2019t have much space.\n\nBison is also better for the environment with low carbon emissions and help preserve grasslands.\n\nIt also has more B vitamins, zinc, and creatine. So you\u2019ll have more energy, better immune system, and less inflammation.\n\nThe only negative with Bison is that it costs more than beef, even the \u201cfree-range\u201d, grass-fed beef. It\u2019s also harder to find in some places.\n\nBut listen, this is your health. My suggestion is if money is an issue, get the bison and just eat less of it.\n\nBetter QUALITY food is always more important than junkier QUANTITY food.\n\nWhat I do to save money is to buy in bulk and then freeze it. I actually get the ground bison in 1 lb packages, but I get like 20 lbs or more since it\u2019s cheaper. I prefer ground rather than steak because it\u2019s just easier to chew for me.\n\nhttp://www.northstarbison.com\n\nhttps://grasslandbeef.com/bison",

It was creamy and yummy.\n\nI was telling this to one of my German athletes at the gym the other day, and he laughed and said, \u201cyes, we did the same\u201d. And then I mentioned \u201cand sometimes my mom would also throw in a tablespoon of Cod Liver Oil\u201d \u2026 at which point my German friend said, \u201cOh my God, we ate the same breakfast.\u201d\n\nI mention this because this is not what you would typically do in the United States.

And how the yolk is just a lot of fat and calories. It\u2019s not good for you. And a dozen egg whites have about 40 grams of \u201cmuscle- building\u201d protein and have less than 200 calories\u2026. And this is how all bodybuilders eat and this is how I\u2019m going to get big and ripped and look like Arnold.\n\nWell, you know\u2026 I was a teenager and thus, \u201cyoung and dumb\u201d.\n\nAnyway, that was the last time I had an egg-white omelet at my parent\u2019s home.\n\nBut in my 20s, I still continued to just have egg whites, never the whole egg. I didn\u2019t question it. If the muscle magazines said to do it, I did it. I blindly followed their suggestions.\n\nHowever, once again, my mom was correct. The yolk DOES contain all the nutrients.\n\nYes, it has all the fat, but it also has more protein too. And the cholesterol in the yolk helps produce testosterone \u2013 the REAL muscle builder!\n\nAdditionally, recent studies have found no link between egg intake and the risk of heart disease. The same review found that eating up to one egg per day might actually reduce your risk of having a stroke.1\n\nIn regards to the protein, which is the primary reason I was eating eggs, the yolk has different amino acids than the white. TOGETHER, they make up all the amino acids and has a very high (90-100) Biological Value (BV) with only Whey protein being higher (100).\n\nThe yolk and thus, the whole egg, as nature created it in perfection, has lots of benefits and far more than only eating the white.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re on a low-calorie diet \u2013 keep in mind that 1 whole egg has about 70 calories, while the white has about 15. So, be mindful of this.\n\nIf you eat whole eggs, it\u2019s ideal to be pasture-raised and honestly, eaten raw. Or, soft boil it.\n\nBut if you\u2019re going to fry it up with some bacon and sausage, then forget it. It\u2019s no longer healthy.\n\nAs to how many total eggs you can have a day \u2013 genetics will dictate this. I know people who have 3-6 whole eggs daily and they have great cholesterol levels. And others their cholesterol levels shoot up and stay up.\n\nHowever, to play it safe, I would suggest about 6-10 whole eggs a WEEK, total. Or maybe 1 a day or 2 every other day.\n\nYou could also throw in some liquid egg whites for additional protein along with the whole eggs. But, that\u2019s up to you.\n\nSo there you have it. Don\u2019t be \u201cyoung and dumb\u201d like me. Eat the whole egg. Don\u2019t bother eating only egg whites. It\u2019s not a complete protein anyway and I\u2019d much rather you had a different protein source.\n\nWild-caught salmon, pasture-raised bison, and whey protein isolate are my favorites. Along with some vegan protein powders \u2013 such as rice, pea, and hemp.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27710205",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about oats and oatmeal. You\u2019ll discover:\n\nSome important health benefits\n\nWhat\u2019s the best form of oats\n\nWhy you should NOT eat them for breakfast and the best time to eat them\n\nThe surprising negatives\n\nHealth warnings of toxicity\n\nAnd I bring up this topic because a subscriber asked the following:\n\n\u201cHello Dr. Sam \u2013 I wanted to know if you eat oatmeal. I eat a big bowl every morning and I wanted to know if this is good or bad? I heard it\u2019s full of vitamins, fiber, and good for lowering my cholesterol, blood sugar, and weight loss. It\u2019s also good for energy. Thus, like a perfect food. Do you agree? Thanks boss!\u201d\n\nThis is correct, improvements in cholesterol, blood sugar, weight loss, and energy levels are the primary reasons people eat oatmeal \u2013 other than the obvious reason that they like how it tastes.\n\nThe Benefits of Oats/Oatmeal\n\nTo begin with, oats are grains and have lots of vitamins and minerals, so they are very nutritious. Especially when compared to other grains.\n\nThey also contain a good amount of soluble fiber and beta-glucan, which helps with cholesterol levels.\n\nNow, it doesn\u2019t lower blood sugar, but it has a decent glycemic load and thus, doesn\u2019t raise blood sugar levels that much. Certainly not like your typical breakfast cereals.\n\nIn fact, the \u201csteel cut\u201d oats are the healthiest because they are minimally processed, which means higher fiber and the lowest effects on blood sugar.\n\nEven though oats are naturally gluten-free, make sure you purchase one that says it on the label. This is because, during the manufacturing process, the machines can touch other foods that do have gluten and will cross-contaminate.\n\nNegatives Of Oats/Oatmeal\n\nNow, there are some things to keep in mind.\n\nMost people do have oatmeal in the morning for breakfast. I don\u2019t do this and warn against it.\n\nThis is because oatmeal is high in the amino acid tryptophan, which helps produce serotonin\u2026 a chemical that can cause a calming and relaxing effect. If fact, you take tryptophan at night to put you to sleep.\n\nSpeaking of sleep, oats also contain melatonin, the sleep hormone.\n\nSo the point is, the last thing you want to do is eat food for breakfast that causes a calming, relaxing, sleeping effect. Instead of eating it in the morning, eat it in the evening to help give you a restful and deeper sleep.\n\nIn the morning, have proteins, fats, vegetables, and maybe some fruit. Whole pasture-raised eggs, veggies, and some blueberries for example.\n\nGreat for your body and brain.\n\nOats Can Be Toxic With Pesticides\n\nLastly, I want to mention something very important about oats, toxicity, and pesticides.\n\nA big study showed that 100% of all the popular brands of oats, tested positive for glyphosate, which is a herbicide. They use this to kill plants, such as weeds.\n\nUnfortunately, glyphosate is toxic to humans as well. In fact, it\u2019s a carcinogen.\n\nThe studies showed that oats contained on average, 360 ppb (parts per billion). That\u2019s twice the \u201callowed\u201d benchmark of health, which is 160 ppb. Sadly, some of the popular samples contained up to 1000 ppb, and some had as high as 2800 ppb.\n\nSo for this reason alone, I suggest you limit your intake of oats. Even when they say \u201corganic\u201d.\n\nOats are fairly healthy grains, which contain lots of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n\nThe \u201csteel cut\u201d oats are the healthiest and make sure you see \u201cgluten-free\u201d on the label.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to have oats, better to have it in the evening instead of the morning because it contains tryptophan and melatonin, both of which cause you to relax and sleep.\n\nLastly, because oats tend to have glyphosates, carcinogenic, and toxic herbicides, I would limit their intake.\n\nAnd if you\u2019d like more information about supporting healthy cholesterol, and blood sugar, or increasing your energy levels, click on this special link.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/9-foods-that-cleanse-detox-your-liver-clinically-proven/",
    "content": "Most people take for granted how important their liver is.\n\nIt performs a variety of essential tasks. It helps with hormones and cholesterol. And of course, detoxification of the junk most people put in their bodies \u2013 such as alcohol and drugs.\n\nAnd today, I\u2019m going to reveal what I consider to be the 9 best, clinically proven foods that help cleanse, detox, and promote healthy liver function.\n\n3 Best \u201cDrinks\u201d For Your Liver\n\nI know water isn\u2019t technically a \u201cfood\u201d, but you can\u2019t live without it and it is consumed through your mouth \u2013 so, I consider it a food.\n\nIt\u2019s the #1 most consumed beverage in the world. I\u2019m sure you know of all the health benefits water has \u2013 this includes liver AND kidney health.\n\nRemembering to drink more water is very important since most people are dehydrated.\n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you how much water you should drink, just try to drink more. Add in a little bit of salt and lemon for better taste, and absorption, and yes \u2013 both also help with liver cleansing.\n\nTea is the #2 most consumed beverage in the world and it also has liver health benefits.\n\nBoth green tea & black tea are very good, especially green tea for additional health benefits.\n\nStudies have shown improvements in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in just a couple of months. You\u2019re also less likely to develop liver cancer.\n\nYou should drink a minimum of 4 cups daily of good quality green tea to get these and other benefits.\n\nThen we have the #3 most consumed beverage in the world, which is coffee. When it comes to liver health, studies have shown that it can be even more powerful than green tea.\n\nStudies have repeatedly shown that drinking coffee helps lower the risk of cirrhosis, which is permanent liver damage.\n\nDrinking coffee may also help reduce the risk of developing liver cancer, and it has positive effects on liver disease and inflammation.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the cool part, the positive benefits are seen in both regular and decaf. This is really important since most people consume too much caffeine.\n\n3 Fruits For Liver Health\n\nGrapefruit contains antioxidants that naturally protect the liver. The two main antioxidants found in grapefruit are naringenin and naringin. The protective effects of grapefruit are known to occur in two ways \u2014 by reducing inflammation and protecting cells.\n\nIt\u2019s better to consume grapefruit itself, and NOT the juice.\n\nBerries \u2013 specifically blueberries and cranberries both contain anthocyanins\u2026 These are antioxidants that give berries their distinctive colors. They\u2019ve also been linked to many health benefits, including liver health.\n\nThey are also low in sugar, so that\u2019s good if you\u2019re concerned about your blood sugar levels.\n\nSimilar to grapefruit, it\u2019s better to EAT the berries as fruit and NOT in the form of juice.\n\nGrapes, especially red and purple grapes, contain a variety of beneficial plant compounds. The most famous one is resveratrol.\n\nSimilar to the berries, you\u2019ll notice that the darker the skin, the more health benefits \u2013 this also includes liver health.\n\nHowever, two things to keep in mind with grapes:\n\nAs great as they taste, they are unfortunately very high in sugar and calories.\n\nIn human studies, grapeseed EXTRACT is what has been shown to have benefits, including liver health. So, you won\u2019t be getting such benefits eating regular grapes.\n\nHowever, if you do, again\u2026eat the fruit and NOT the juice.\n\nFATS For Liver Health\n\nOlive oil is an amazing fat with many health benefits, including positive effects on the heart and metabolic and liver health.\n\nMake sure you use 100% extra virgin, cold-pressed olive oil. You need at least 1 tablespoon daily. Raw is better, such as with your salad or similar. But, you can cook with it as well.\n\nStudies have found that a diet higher in nuts is associated with a decreased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\n\nI think the best fats are Almonds (preferably without the skin), pistachios, and walnuts.\n\nAs much as love eating nuts, keep in mind that nuts are very high and dense in calories.\n\nOmega 3 fats have so many health benefits as I\u2019m sure you are aware, and this includes liver health.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fatty fish such as Salmon, are healthy fats that help reduce inflammation and have been associated with a lower risk of heart disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like eating fish, try to consume at least 4 grams of fish oil daily.",

Personally, as much as I love eating different types of nuts, I typically don\u2019t and I don\u2019t think most people should either\u2026 especially if your goal is to lose weight.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s remove two nuts that aren\u2019t technically nuts and that\u2019s peanuts and cashews.\n\nBoth of these are actually part of the legume family and thus, they are BEANS and not nuts.\n\nAnd the problem is they are high in lectins and can act as allergens for many people.\n\nLectins are known as \u201canti-nutrients\u201d and are linked to obesity, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nSo, unfortunately, you should not eat these two nuts or legumes.\n\nThe skin of almonds is also high in lectins, so it should be removed before you eat almonds.\n\nNuts should also be eaten raw, not roasted and certainly, nut fried in oils \u2013 which many \u201croasted\u201d nuts are.\n\nThe main problem with nuts is that they are very high in calories.\n\nFor example, 1 oz (28 grams) of raw almonds has about 170 calories, most of it coming from fat.\n\nIf you\u2019re like most people, including myself, you\u2019ll end up eating a lot more. Like chips, they can be addictive.\n\nThe truth is that most nuts have a lot of good nutrients, especially when eaten raw.\n\nUnfortunately, because they are so high and dense in calories, you\u2019ll end up eating much more than you had hoped or think you are and this typically ends up causing you to gain weight.\n\nSo, unless you have very good self-control and use portion control, you might want to think twice about eating nuts, especially if your goal is to lose weight.",

    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is about a high-protein diet, especially as it pertains to maximum muscle growth.\n\nHow do you know if you are eating too much protein? And is eating more protein going to help you gain that much more muscle?\n\nMuscle growth takes a lot of time, many months.\n\nGenetics aside, it\u2019s very much hormone-controlled. Better hormones = more muscle and less fat.\n\nThe Problem With High Protein Diet\n\nA high-protein diet will make you:\n\nFeel totally run down and tired all the time\n\nCause stomach & digestive problems\n\nThirsty and dehydrated\n\nNot sleeping well and poor sleep causes a million health problems.\n\nAnd you will NOT gain a ton of muscle, anyway.\n\nA very high protein diet is not sustainable long-term.\n\nThe truth is, for the most extreme athletes, the absolute highest amount of protein they need is no more than 1.5 grams per pound of body weight.\n\nMost will do perfectly fine with 1 gram. And if you don\u2019t exercise, half of that is fine.\n\nEating protein increases protein synthesis \u2013 which means more muscle. This is good.\n\nHowever, the more protein you eat, the more you also oxidize. Which means the more protein you burn.\n\nThis decreases protein synthesis.\n\nSo after a certain amount, the opposite effects happen and you can slowly become a little more catabolic, instead of anabolic.\n\nSpeaking of anabolic, by optimizing your hormones, you dramatically increase anabolism and protein synthesis.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not good for your kidneys to eat so much protein for years and years.\n\nSo, What\u2019s The Solution?\n\nLastly, you better make sure if you\u2019re eating all that protein, it\u2019s of great quality. Such as grass-fed beef and bison, wild-caught salmon, pasture-raised chicken and eggs, and so forth.\n\nRegular junky protein which most of you will be eating will only cause more damage to your body, inflammation, gut problems, and hormonal imbalances.\n\nInstead of extra protein, add healthy fats and more carbs. BOTH will help hormones and allow you to build more muscle and have more stamina and strength.\n\nAgain, stop going to extremes. It never works.",

And yes, it has vitamins and minerals too.\n\nNormal Blood Sugar If you select the right type of oats, you can keep your blood sugar in a healthy range, which is good for energy and mood.\n\nKeeps You Full Because of the nutrient density and the high fiber, it tends to keep you full, longer. So, you won\u2019t get hungry so quickly.\n\nHealthy Cholesterol Levels Studies have shown that oats can help lower cholesterol. Oats contain Beta-glucan, which can bind to cholesterol-containing foods and substances in your body and move them through your digestive system.\n\nHealthy Blood Pressure Levels Oats can help promote healthy blood pressure levels because they contain antioxidants called avenanthramides [avey-nan-thromides]\n\nIn addition to these 5 main health benefits, oats are also good at keeping your regular and colon healthy. So, if you have constipation, it\u2019s another reason to try eating more oats.\n\nWhich Type Of Oats Are The Best?\n\nThey are called \u201csteel-cut\u201d because they are literally cut with steel blades. The benefit here is it allows liquid to penetrate more surface area, meaning these oats cook more quickly than the other oats.\n\nAlso, because steel-cut oats are minimally processed, less than the other forms, they also have the lowest glycemic index, which means they don\u2019t cause high blood sugar and insulin levels.\n\nAll of this means a good source of carbohydrates for energy and your workouts, while also keeping your blood sugar levels in a good range \u2013 all of which can accelerate weight loss and show off your abs.\n\nNow, this does NOT mean you eat your oats with a bunch of other unhealthy junk and extra calories such as sugar, butter, and so forth.\n\nMaybe you can add in a little bit of fruit of Stevia for sweetness.\n\nTry to stay away from \u201cinstant oats\u201d or other processed oats or those that come in packages with sugar and fat added for flavor.\n\nAgain, keep it as natural as possible.\n\nAlso, keep track of total calories. As great as oats are, they are also dense in calories.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/why-bananas-are-bad-for-potassium-blood-pressure-sugar/",
    "content": "I don\u2019t know why, but if you ask someone what\u2019s a good source of potassium, most people always say the same thing \u2013 Bananas. Maybe the Chiquita Banana company did some great commercials for it in the old days, but I don\u2019t get it.\n\nI bring this up because I had a subscriber ask me the following question:\n\n\u201cDear Dr. Robbins \u2013 I\u2019d like your advice, please. I went to my doctor and he said I have blood pressure problems. He prescribed me a drug for it and then to my surprise, gave me some nutritional and diet advice. He said I need to eliminate salt from my diet and eat more bananas for potassium, which will improve my blood pressure. What do you think?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m really surprised he gave you any diet advice, even though he was wrong.\n\nDiagnosing someone with blood pressure problems is the easiest job in the world. The nurse takes your blood pressure and it\u2019s usually with an automated machine \u2013 so no work for the doctor. If it\u2019s high, your doctor has immediate \u201cevidence\u201d to prescribe you a drug and that\u2019s it. He\u2019s done and he moves on to the next patient.\n\nNo exams or blood tests or scans. It takes them a couple of minutes.\n\nSuper easy for the doctor.\n\nYour Doctor\u2019s \u201cBad\u201d Recommendations\n\nSo, get back to your doctor\u2019s \u201cbad\u201d recommendations.\n\nFirst, you should NOT eliminate salt at all. Your body and most of the planet are made of saltwater. I put natural salts on most of my food \u2013 Himalayan or Celtic salt. They have minerals that help balance the sodium and help reduce anxiety and stress hormones, such as cortisol.\n\nThe real problem with salt is what\u2019s found in all packaged foods. So, the better suggestion is to eliminate packaged foods, not salt.\n\nSecondly, bananas are not an ideal food source for potassium. Especially if you want healthy blood pressure because bananas are high in sugar. They have a high glycemic index and load. Thus, they increase blood sugar levels, which raises blood pressure.\n\nWhat Are Better Potassium Sources?\n\nThere are much better and healthier foods, that have higher amounts of potassium and fewer calories: [** potassium per 100 grams (mg)]\n\nCompared to Bananas (328 mg; 135 calories)\n\nBeet Greens (909 mg; 19 calories)\n\nChard, swiss (549 mg; 18 calories)\n\nSpinach (466 mg; 21 calories)\n\nTomato paste (1,014 mg; 54 calories)\n\nDried Apricots (1162 mg; 78 calories)\n\nYams (670 mg; 79 calories)\n\nWild-caught salmon (628 mg; 155 calories)\n\nSoybeans (539 mg; 127 calories)\n\nAvocado (which is really a fruit) (585 mg; 120 calories)\n\nThere are a lot of other foods, but I wanted to list some of the best and give you all the macronutrient options as well \u2013 proteins, fats, carbs, and so forth.\n\nAdditionally, if you needed more potassium and didn\u2019t want to eat these foods, your last option is that you can also take potassium pills as well. The CITRATE version. Take 1 pill, which is 99 mgs, 2-3x daily with food.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also increase your water intake.\n\nAnd if you want healthy blood pressure, there are also some amazing herbs, vitamins, and minerals that can help support healthy blood pressure better than drugs, while also improving the strength of your arteries and veins.\n\nAt the end of this article, I\u2019ve listed the best nutrients and also how my own father supported healthy blood pressure in just a few days \u2013 naturally.\n\nTake action on what you\u2019ve learned today. Please don\u2019t just listen and walk away.\n\nEat some of the foods I mentioned today and take proven ingredients that I\u2019ve listed in a special link to support your health and healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today is a topic that I needed to bring up and should have done so a long time ago. After all, my goal is to help reduce the confusion and give you more clarity about health, fitness, and longevity. While making things easier, more convenient, and FUN at the same time.\n\nAnd today\u2019s topic is from a viewer question:\n\n\u201cDoc, I\u2019m going insane. I have no idea what I should or shouldn\u2019t eat. What diet to follow or avoid. High or low this\u2026 or eliminate that \u2026 so on and so forth. It\u2019s all so confusing and at the end of the day, I feel like I can\u2019t eat anything. Can you please give me some foods that my family and I can eat, that\u2019s just safe and healthy for all of us, regardless of our goals?\u201d\n\nThis is a great question and one that I\u2019ve asked myself and researched for years. It seems the older I get, the simpler I want my life to be.\n\nAnd today, I\u2019m going to give you the best foods to eat regardless of your health, age, or sex.\n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you how much to eat or any of that stuff. I\u2019m just going to quickly list them for each of the main macronutrients.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also list what I eat most of the time as well.\n\nEveryone\u2019s favorite food is probably carbohydrates. And this is one of the most controversial macronutrients. Some say you should never eat them and be zero or low carbs \u2013 like the keto or meat-eaters.\n\nThen we have vegans and plant-based diets that have very high carbohydrates and are also very healthy.\n\nFirst, I do NOT believe you should eliminate any macronutrients \u2013 carbohydrates, proteins, or fats.\n\nYou should have to make good decisions based on the TYPE and QUANTITY.\n\nThe best source of carbohydrates is from plants and vegetables. Eat them as much as you want. The best would be\n\nYou can eat the last two raws and the first ones should be lightly steamed.\n\nME: I eat mainly broccoli, Brussels sprouts, celery, and cucumbers, along with mixed greens in a salad.\n\nOf course, most of us can\u2019t live only on vegetables. And if you\u2019re an athlete or exercise a lot, you\u2019ll need higher carbohydrates. The best would be:\n\nLentils (soaked/washed for 24 hours or pressure cooked)\n\nME: My main source of carbs is yams and white rice. I do have some lentils, but no matter how I cook them, I just don\u2019t digest legumes very well and many people are the same.\n\nI know people scare you into NOT eating fruit because of the fructose, but that\u2019s just silly.\n\nYES, high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice must be avoided. Dried fruits should be limited. But fruit is mainly water and fiber. It\u2019s fine, eat it.\n\nHowever, the best fruits are:\n\nBerries: Blackberries, Raspberries, Blueberries, Strawberries\n\nPomegranate (NOT the juice and eat the seeds)\n\nAvocados (yes, this is technically a fruit, even though I categorize it as a \u201cfat\u201d)\n\nOther fruits are pretty good as well, but these are the best and have the least issues.\n\nME: I mainly just eat lemons daily, blueberries year-round, and pineapples occasionally.\n\nOf course, everyone loves protein and eats as much as they can. Personally, I believe most people are eating too much protein and most definitely the WRONG kinds.\n\nI think out of all the proteins, low-mercury fish is the best, and wild-caught, sockeye Salmon, anchovies, and sardines are ideal.\n\nThe next best is grass-fed bison. It\u2019s much better than a cow.\n\nBoth of these protein sources are expensive, but quality is far more important than quantity. If you need more protein in your diet, add in vegetable protein sources such as organic rice or hemp protein.\n\nSome pastured-raised whole eggs\n\nI have small amounts of grass-fed, cold filtration, whey isolate during my workouts.\n\nNo pork, chicken, or shellfish.\n\nAnd the final category is fats. This one people really screw up. They have the wrong fats all the time, this includes all the ketogenic people.\n\nThe best and safest are\n\nAvocados \u2013 it\u2019s mainly fat, even though it\u2019s technically a \u201cfruit\u201d\n\nRaw Nuts: walnuts are the best. Macadamia, almond, and pistachios are second in line.\n\nOILS: Extra virgin olive oil (you better pick a good brand because most are fake), Macadamia nut, Udo\u2019s Blend, fish, hemp\n\nIdeally, you should NOT heat your fats. Eat them raw.\n\nI did not list animal fats, seeds, or vegetable oils. These aren\u2019t good for you and can be very bad, especially when fried in.\n\nME: I mainly have fish oil, extra virgin olive, and Udo\u2019s oil the majority of the time.\n\nAre there other good foods that I didn\u2019t list, yes. However, I listed the ones I feel are the best and can be utilized by almost everyone, at any age.\n\nAnd these are the foods I eat.\n\nYes, I know it\u2019s limited and boring. However, if you eat these foods 80-90% of the time, you can also enjoy other foods without worrying about any negative issues.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/worst-vegetables-you-must-avoid/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal the worst vegetables you must avoid eating. This is important since I think most of us think that all vegetables are good for you, but this is NOT the truth as you\u2019ll discover today.\n\nThis is part two of my article series about vegetables. Part one I revealed the best vegetables you must eat daily.\n\nSo, after you read this one, make sure you read the \u201cbest vegetables\u201d one. And I\u2019ll share the specific article link to that at the end of this short article.\n\nNightshade Vegetables\n\nsuch as Squash, eggplants, pumpkins, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and zucchini. Most people think these are vegetables, but they are actually fruits. Just remember that if it has a seed, it\u2019s a fruit and not a vegetable.\n\nThese foods are typically high in inflammation-causing lectins. They cause stomach problems and are generally not good for your gut health, especially when eaten in higher amounts or daily.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to completely avoid them. IF you do want to eat them occasionally, make sure they are cooked, and most importantly do NOT eat the skin or seeds.\n\nAnd, go by how you feel and look. If you start to have skin problems, emotional issues, etc. \u2013 then genetically you shouldn\u2019t be eating them at all.\n\nYup, this so-called healthy food has issues. First off, it decreases thyroid levels1, which is a big no-no. However, as with all vegetables, there are ways around it.\n\nIF you do want to still have kale, cook it and eat them in small amounts, 2-3x weekly. And make sure you supplement iodine into your diet. This can be in the form of iodine drops or iodized sea salt.\n\nAnd please do NOT have any kale juice \u2013 it\u2019s too concentrated.\n\nAgain, if you have no issues with kale, then enjoy it. However many people do, especially when eaten daily and in larger amounts.\n\nThese days, soy is completely fake, especially in the US. It\u2019s genetically modified \u2013 even if it says Non-GMO. It\u2019s full of pesticides, even if it says Organic. It increases estrogen and decreases thyroid. IF you want, have a little bit of edamame once in a while, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nThese are vegetables, very high in carbs, and no protein. They digest rapidly and shoot up blood sugar levels, which is really bad for your health.2 As stated in my \u201cbest vegetables\u201d article, yams and sweet potatoes are better.\n\nThese are on my \u201csafe\u201d list, however \u2013 IF you have candida, which many people do, having this fungus vegetable, a mushroom, could make things worse.\n\nMany years ago I dealt with candida in the form of white spots on my skin, which is called Tinea Versicolor.\n\nTo make a very long story short, after trying lots of different drugs and diets, the problem always came back. So, I went on a complete candida cleanse diet and did my best to avoid any foods with yeast, fungi, and so forth. Again, I won\u2019t get into the details unless you want me to in a future article.\n\nAnd well, after many months, I finally cured my yeast issues and I never again had the Tinea Versicolor and white spots.\n\nYes, 2-3 specific supplements and diet changes PERMANENTLY cured it.\n\nHowever, one day my dad made me a mushroom omelet, and bam, the white spots came back.\n\nYOU may not be dealing with this, but just keep this in mind. Antibiotics, sugar, bread, and foods with yeast cause candida and yeast problems in many people, and mushrooms could easily make it worse if you\u2019re sensitive to them.\n\nSo again, IF you have candida in your system, which many of us do, especially women \u2013 then it\u2019s best to avoid mushrooms.\n\nLastly, I want to mention Corn because most people think corn is a vegetable, but it\u2019s a grain. You should avoid it. Sadly, it\u2019s in so many foods because it\u2019s cheap.\n\nIt causes inflammation, high in lectins, it\u2019s heavily genetically modified, and is full of pesticides. Maybe you can have some non-gmo, organic popcorn once in a while as a treat. It\u2019s filling and full of fiber. However, don\u2019t make a habit of eating corn, daily.\n\nSo again, these vegetables are great and fine, but some people just can\u2019t have any \u2026 and most should limit them. And if you do want to have the mentioned vegetables, make sure you prepare them correctly, as I mentioned in the article.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to read Part 1 of this article, Best Vegetables To Eat.\n\nhttp://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#nutrient-interactions\n\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2014/01/24/the-problem-with-potatoes/",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/why-cashews-are-bad-for-you/",
    "content": "A while back in 2020 I did an article about why and how peanuts are NOT good for most people and you shouldn\u2019t eat them. This includes peanut butter.\n\nPersonally, I like both of these foods \u2013 peanuts and peanut butter.\n\nIn fact, I like eating nuts because they are crunchy \u2013 especially if they\u2019re roasted and salted.\n\nAnd one of my favorite \u201cnuts\u201d of all is cashew.\n\nI don\u2019t know why\u2026 maybe because they are also sweeter than other nuts.\n\nAccording to the newest research in 2023 about 90% of the world\u2019s cashews are consumed in the USA.\n\nIn fact, the two most popular nuts are peanuts and cashews.\n\nThe irony is that neither of these two foods is even \u201cnuts\u201d. They are actually classified as \u201clegumes\u201d, which are beans.\n\nMore specifically, cashew is actually a SEED harvested from the cashew apple, the fruit produced by cashew trees.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that the cashew is part of the same family as poison ivy, something you obviously want to stay away from.\n\nIn fact, the shell of the cashew contains a highly irritant and toxic acid that causes blisters, rashes, and burning sensations.\n\nThe poor people who work in cashew facilities are often riddled with allergies and skin problems. Unfortunately, they need the money so they deal with it.\n\nThe 2 Main Problems With Cashews\n\nHowever, there are two main problems with cashews and why I tell people to not eat them.\n\nThe primary one I\u2019ll tell you about in a minute\u2026\n\n#2 Problem \u2013 Calcium Issues\n\nBut the secondary problem and one that rarely anyone ever speaks of is kidney stones.\n\nThis is because cashews are high in oxalate salts, which cause calcium absorption problems.\n\nAnd thus, the excess calcium that\u2019s unabsorbed can lead to the formation of kidney stones.\n\nAnd given enough time, it can also lead to calcium deposits in your arteries and veins\u2026\n\nWhich can eventually lead to clogged arteries, blood flow, and circulation problems, causing a heart attack or a stroke.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about kidney stones or blood flow problems, I\u2019ve got a link below this article about improving circulation.\n\n#1 Problem \u2013 Inflammation\n\nNow, I believe the primary problem with cashews is that they are highly inflammatory.\n\nFor example, patients and clients that I know\u2026 who are older and have arthritis, get almost instant pain, due to the inflammation, when eating cashews.\n\nAnd I have the same problems in my shoulders if I eat too many of them, too often.\n\nAnd I found this out by mistake actually\u2026\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because cashews also contain Lectins, I don\u2019t know.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ve heard me say before with 100% certainty, that inflammation is one of the leading causes of so many health problems and it accelerates aging \u2014 both your body and brain.\n\nBecause it\u2019s such an important topic, I\u2019m putting together a short, 3 part series about inflammation and pain \u2013 the REAL causes and easy solutions.\n\nAre There Any Health Benefits?\n\nYes, I know that many websites and so-called experts will tell you about all the benefits of cashews. Including companies that sell and manufacture these nuts.\n\nBut, there\u2019s nothing better, different, special, or more beneficial about this \u201cfake\u201d nut, than any other legit nut.\n\nAs I said, it\u2019s my favorite-tasting nut \u2013 but I rarely have them now.\n\nSo, if you have pain, allergies, blood flow issues, or similar problems, it\u2019s best to avoid cashews and peanuts.\n\nOtherwise, just have them occasionally as a treat.\n\nOr just eat other nuts \u2013 like almonds, almond butter, and almond milk if you want a safer and healthier alternative.\n\nAnd make sure you visit the important links I mentioned in today\u2019s article about improving blood flow and reducing inflammation.",

    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is for anyone who is interested in following a low-carb diet \u2014 whether it\u2019s for weight loss or blood sugar or both.\n\nThese days, everyone is on some \u201cfad\u201d diet that\u2019s usually some kind of an \u201cextreme\u201d eating plan.\n\nThey might be on a very high protein diet or high-fat diet or intermittent fasting diet or low carb diet or no-carb ketogenic diet or something similar.\n\nAnd the end result is always that people can NOT sustain this type of eating long-term.\n\nThey feel deprived, they get frustrated, they have low energy, and they lose willpower\u2026 which ends up causing them to feel like crap, give up and gain all the weight back.\n\nNot only is this bad for you physically \u2013 but it really kills you emotionally.\n\nYour body doesn\u2019t like extremes. It likes stability and in the medical world, this is called \u201chomeostasis\u201d.\n\nAnyway, today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss why \u201clow carb diets\u201d can be bad for your health \u2013 both physically AND emotionally.\n\nOkay, so why is the extreme \u201clow carb\u201d diet bad for you?\n\nHard To Exercise & Build Muscle\n\nI think one of the most important ingredients for life-long health and better hormones is exercise. This includes BOTH aerobic (such as walking) and anaerobic (such as lifting weights).\n\nHowever, it\u2019s very hard to put in the effort, or have the energy or have a good, muscular workout if you\u2019re on low carbs all the time. It\u2019s impossible. You\u2019ll quickly lose strength and muscle.\n\nAnd the more muscle you lose, the slower your metabolism.\n\nScrews Up Your Hormones\n\nAnother problem is that long-term low-carb diets decrease thyroid production \u2013 which as you know, is one of the keys for a faster metabolism. And this negatively affects women more than men.\n\nAlso, low-carb diets increase cortisol \u2013 your stress hormone. For men, this causes an immediate decrease and shut down in testosterone\u2026 which, means lower libido, happiness, and muscle loss.\n\nLow carb diets also decrease IGF, which is an Insulin-like Growth Factor. This hormone causes all the benefits of GH (Growth Hormone). GH requires healthy levels of insulin and thyroid, to convert to IGF.\n\nLow carb diets dramatically decrease this.\n\nMost people lack fiber in their diets as it is. Low carb diets dramatically lower your fiber and thus, reduces bowel movements, cause constipation, and is the leading cause of colon cancer \u2013 which, by the way, is increasing these days.\n\nLack Of Vitamins, Minerals & Antioxidants\n\nThe other problem with eliminating most carbohydrates is the lack of key nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Low or no fruits, vegetables, healthy carbs, and grains causes this and no amount of multivitamin supplements can replace what\u2019s naturally found in nature, in the correct ratios.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s bad enough that the foods are already lacking in nutrients these days, but eliminating carbs guarantees a massive deficiency.\n\nReplacing Carbs With the Wrong Foods\n\nThe other problem I see is that people are replacing carbohydrates with the wrong foods \u2014 higher proteins and bad, unhealthy fats.\n\nFinally, low-carb diets tend to cause cravings, especially for sugar.\n\nYour brain and muscles like glucose. Too big of a drop in blood sugar causes an increase in hunger and appetite.\n\nSo at this point, you have to use willpower all the time and you know that\u2019s not going to last too long. This is why most people give up eventually.\n\nHow To Do It Correctly\n\nOne thing I want to make clear is that I\u2019m NOT against lowering your carbohydrates, I just don\u2019t believe in \u201clow\u201d carb diets.\n\nTo keep it simple, if you want to lower your carbs, follow an \u201cisocaloric\u201d diet. That means \u2153 of your calories come from carbs, protein, and fats.\n\nSuper easy to follow.\n\nFor carbs, eat lower glycemic/load carbs \u2013 such as vegetables, yams, sweet potatoes, squash, white rice (yes, NOT brown), and some fruits that are in season.\n\nMake sure you have some fiber with all meals, as well as healthy fats \u2014 such as olive, macadamia nut, coconut, fish, and raw nuts and seeds (no cashews or peanuts).\n\nAnd then some healthy proteins such as pastured eggs, collagen, grass-fed beef, salmon, and small amounts of free-range chicken.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re really concerned about your blood sugar levels because your blood test showed that it\u2019s elevated, then add in specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals that can help support healthy blood sugar levels AND most importantly, support proper insulin sensitivity.\n\nJust take these supplements with all of your carb meals \u2013 that\u2019s it.\n\nVery simple and easy to follow. You\u2019ll feel great and look younger. And it won\u2019t feel like \u201cwork\u201d, nor will be feeling deprived.\n\nBest of all, you can enjoy your food \u2013 including when you go out to eat.\n\nRemember, you obviously do NOT want bad blood sugar levels, but you also don\u2019t want \u201clow\u201d either.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely one of the most important things you should focus on for health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Over the past few months, I\u2019ve gotten lots of questions about a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n\nAre they healthier than meat-eaters (carnivores)?\n\nAre they lacking in nutrients, since they don\u2019t eat animal products?\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nWhat are typical mistakes?\n\nHow does it affect exercise performance, muscle size, and strength?\n\nDoes it prevent health problems?\n\nIs it easier to lose weight on it or will I get fat?\n\nThese are all great questions and today I\u2019m going to give you a quick overview and summary about all of this.\n\nDifference Between Vegetarian & Vegan\n\nBefore I start, I want to first give some clarity to the difference between a vegetarian vs a vegan.\n\nA vegetarian excludes meat, poultry, and seafood from their diet. Some vegetarians also exclude dairy, some don\u2019t, and some may consume eggs.\n\nLikewise, vegans also avoid meat, poultry, and seafood, but they also take it a step further by eliminating all animal products from their diet. This includes any type of animal milk and eggs.\n\nVegans avoid foods produced using animals or animal products in any way, including honey. Many vegans also avoid household products, clothing, or other items made from animal products or tested on animals.\n\nHowever, since we\u2019re discussing \u201cdiet\u201d today, the main difference will be that a Vegan will also NOT eat any dairy or eggs.\n\nSo, let me quickly answer the earlier mentioned questions:\n\nAre vegans healthier than meat-eaters (carnivores)?\n\nI have lots of vegetarian and vegan friends and associates. So, I\u2019ve seen all the different versions of \u201chealth\u201d in this eating category.\n\nOne of my friends is a really smart guy. He\u2019s a vegetarian, does yoga, and teaches meditation daily. However, he is NOT \u201chealthy\u201d in my opinion because he\u2019s overweight, has high cholesterol, and has high blood pressure.\n\nWhy?\u2026 Because when we go out to eat, he\u2019ll order fried mozzarella sticks, french fries, and a vegetarian burger with lots of ketchup and dressing. Just because he\u2019s not eating meat, does NOT mean that he is having a healthy diet.\n\nFirst, as you may already know \u2013 I don\u2019t approve of dairy.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t think fried foods and sauces are healthy.\n\nTechnically, a bag of potato chips can be part of a vegetarian/vegan diet. But, this is NOT a healthy food choice.\n\nThe point is that no matter what type of diet you are on \u2013 you have to prepare foods in a healthy way.\n\nHowever, assuming one does this, a diet that\u2019s primarily plant-based, is without a doubt, extremely healthy and one that I suggest everyone try.\n\nIn fact, over the years I\u2019ve put dozens of my clients and patients, who were very sick or ill, on a plant-based, vegan diet\u2026 and every single person was healthier because of it.\n\nHOWEVER, some of them couldn\u2019t sustain it long-term for over a year and we had to make changes and adjustments, and I\u2019ll tell you why and how in a minute.\n\nAre vegans lacking in nutrients, since they don\u2019t eat animal products?\n\nAssuming their diet is well balanced, the only thing they will be lacking over time are some B vitamins and more specifically, B12. This is an easy fix. You can take a sublingual B12 or I suggest B12 shot and sometimes, a full B-Complex shot.\n\nHowever, some are lacking in essential fatty acids, especially Omega 3s, iron, calcium, iodine or zinc.1 Again, all of this can be fixed with better food choices or the addition of supplements.\n\nSome are also lacking complete proteins, all the essential amino acids. And I\u2019ll tell you how you can fix this in a minute.\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nAssuming the vegan diet is done right, it\u2019s well balanced, no fried foods, and so forth, there are LOTS of benefits:\n\nVegans tend to be thinner than non-vegans.2\n\nThe interesting part is that a vegan diet can cause weight loss faster than a calorie-restricted diet. And the reason is that the diet is high in fiber and bulk, so you can eat a lot of food, get full and it\u2019ll still be fewer calories.3\n\nVegans tend to have lower blood sugar levels, higher insulin sensitivity, and up to a 78% lower risk of developing serious blood sugar issues.4,5\n\nVegans generally eat considerably more legumes, fruits, and vegetables than non-vegans. This may explain why a recent review of 96 studies found that vegans may benefit from a 15% lower risk of developing tumors.7\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more evidence about tumor protection and prevention, that I could keep going. Suffice to say, a plant-based vegan diet is very beneficial at reducing your risk for health problems.\n\nObviously, eating fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, and fiber is linked to better health and also a lower risk of heart problems.\n\nStudies comparing vegans to the general population report that vegans may benefit from up to a 75% lower risk of developing high blood pressure.7\n\nVegans may also have up to a 42% lower risk of dying from heart problems 7\n\nAnyway, these are just some of the big benefits. There are also other benefits such as reduced inflammation, better skin, less pain, better digestion, and colon health.\n\nWhat are typical mistakes?\n\nSadly, I\u2019ve seen a lot of mistakes by \u201cnewbie\u201d vegans or people who haven\u2019t done the research yet.\n\nEating unhealthy, fried, and processed foods.\n\nLacking in Omega 3 fats and vitamins and minerals like B12, Iron, Calcium, Iodine, and Zinc.\n\nNot drinking enough water. Since Vegans have more fiber, they also require more water.\n\nNot eating enough protein and essential amino acids, which I\u2019ll get to in a minute.\n\nNot taking getting regular blood and hormone tests. For some people, a vegan diet lowers lots of youthful hormones such as testosterone in men, estrogen in women, growth hormone, and thyroid \u2013 just to name a few.\n\nHow does it affect exercise performance, muscle size, and strength?\n\nThis is a big question I\u2019ve received from those that exercise regularly.\n\nThe truth is, this one is hit or miss. SOME people do better on a vegan diet. Some, do worse.\n\nGenetics, age, and proper planning have a lot to do with it.\n\nAs I stated earlier, I\u2019ve had male athletes on very well-designed vegan diets and after a few months, their performance drops. Less muscle and strength. And when taking a hormone test, you can clearly see why \u2013 lowered testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, when I\u2019ve modified it with a \u201chybrid\u201d vegan diet, their performance goes right back to before and in fact, it gets better. Of course, this took a lot of experimenting for me to figure out the right solution and the changes that needed to be made.\n\nSome of the changes that were made were that we did add in some animal protein \u2013 a little bit of salmon, pasture-raised bison or beef, and whole eggs. THIS was only for those people who were okay with this change.\n\nWe also added vegan protein powders to increase their total protein intake and essential amino acids \u2013 such as rice and hemp protein.\n\nAnd if you\u2019d like more about this topic, you can customize your own vegan protein powders, so your diet is better balanced, and your athletic performance and muscle mass don\u2019t decrease.\n\nStudies have shown that people who eat a more plant-based diet, especially Vegans \u2013 do live longer and are healthier.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a LOT that can be said about this.\n\nFor example, people who live the longest (over 100 years old), which some researchers refer to as the \u201cBlue Zones\u201d, are more plant-based diets. HOWEVER, they are not vegans. They still consume animal proteins such as beef and fish. But, it\u2019s just at a much lower amount \u2013 like 3 oz, 1-2x weekly.\n\nAdditionally, these people exercise, don\u2019t eat processed foods, are outside in the sunshine, manage their stress levels by resting and sleeping better, and so forth.\n\nAll things considered, a plant-based vegan diet is very healthy. For some, they can stick to it all the time. For others, doing so 80-90% of the time with the occasional consumption of healthy sources of animal protein is still extremely beneficial and will for sure reduce your risks for many illnesses.\n\nAt the very least, I suggest you reduce some of your animal proteins and substitute more plants and even vegan protein powders.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19279075\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23695207\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26853923\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671114/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26853923\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871675",

    "title": "How Much Water Should You Really Drink? | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/how-much-water-should-you-really-drink/",
    "content": "I got a question the other day from Tim asking\n\n\u201cHow much water do I need daily? One \u201cexpert,\u201d says 8-10 glasses and another expert says \u201cdrink only when thirsty\u201d \u2013 what should I do?\u201d\n\nSo this is a very important topic because for you to survive and live, you NEED 3 things, in this order of importance:\n\nAir (oxygen) \u2013 without it you die in minutes.\n\nWater (hydration) \u2013 without it you\u2019d die in a few days.\n\nFood (calories) \u2013 without it you\u2019d die in about a week or so.\n\nBased on this, water is obviously very important.\n\nSo the fact is you don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d much water to SURVIVE.\n\nYou can get it primarily from the foods you eat, assuming you have a healthy diet.\n\nIn fact, I know plenty of people who NEVER have a glass of water and haven\u2019t had any in years and years.\n\nThey may have coffee, tea, soda, juice, \u201cenergy drinks\u201d, alcohol and so forth \u2013 but NEVER a drop of water.\n\nIt tastes \u201cdisgusting\u201d to them!!?\n\nHowever, some of these \u201cnon-water drinking\u201d people I know, also happen to be very close to me \u2014 friends and family. And over the years, the following has happened.\n\nOne deals with kidney stones.\n\nOne has colon cancer.\n\nOne has painful cramps, especially at night, and during sleep.\n\nOne is constantly tired and fatigued and has adrenal problems.\n\nOne has polycystic kidney disease.\n\nOne has a uric acid disease.\n\nOne has headaches and migraines, often.\n\nOne is always constipated and needs to take laxatives daily.\n\nOne has high blood pressure.\n\n\u2026 well, you get the point.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not making this up.\n\nI actually sat down and took notes because as I thought of one person and their health ailment, another one popped in my head, and then another and so forth.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m only reporting to you the people that I\u2019ve known personally over the past few decades.\n\nAnd of course, there are probably thousands of people who don\u2019t have health problems and never drink water\u2026.\n\nOr MAYBE THEY DO, but they don\u2019t think the cause of their health problems is simply due to the lack of water consumption???\n\nThus, NOT drinking any water MAY cause health problems\u2026 if not already, probably EVENTUALLY one day.\n\nJust remember though, your goal in life is not to \u201cget by\u201d or \u201csurvive\u201d. You should be THRIVING.\n\nIs \u201cThirst\u201d A Good Signal?\n\nSome people/experts will say \u201cthirst is a good signal\u201d. Maybe\u2026 but, probably not.\n\nThirst is usually an indicator that you are or will soon become dehydrated.\n\nSome will argue with a silly \u201cstudy\u201d saying otherwise or that there isn\u2019t \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d, but I disagree.\n\nBesides, how many people are really cognizant and in-tune with their body to really, stop, and take note when they\u2019re thirsty and then to take immediate action and drink some water?\n\nIn fact, as I\u2019m saying this, I noticed I\u2019m now thirsty. But I\u2019m not going to stop what I\u2019m doing right now just to get some water.\n\nAnd guess what, the feeling of being \u201cthirsty\u201d will soon pass and then I will have forgotten all about it.\n\nHowever, that does NOT mean my body magically got hydrated.\n\nIt just means I\u2019ve ignored it because I\u2019m busy or getting water wasn\u2019t convenient for me at that moment I \u201cfelt thirsty\u201d.\n\nAlso, when someone actually feels thirsty, they rarely go get a cup of water. They\u2019ll usually drink some other type of liquid or beverage.\n\nAnd IF they do get some water, they typically drink just a little bit, a couple of \u201cgulps\u201d or \u201csips\u201d \u2026 just enough to wet their mouth, but NOT to hydrate their body.\n\nCan You Get Water From Food?\n\nThis brings up the other issue that some \u201cexperts\u201d will say about how you can get your water from the foods you eat and other beverages.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how the body works.\n\nDon\u2019t think for a second that the water in your protein (meat, chicken, fish, eggs) or your favorite beverage (coffee, tea, soda, juice, alcohol) is going to do or replace\u2026 what clean, purified water will do for your body and health.\n\nThis is just utterly stupid.\n\nALL animals drink water, every single day IF they have access to it.\n\nAnd their diets are healthier than ours because they typically DO have a lot more plants, vegetables, and fruits, which contain more water.\n\nThey also don\u2019t have any other kind of \u201cbeverage\u201d \u2013 like energy drinks or coffee or soda or alcohol \u2014 which are all acidic, full of chemicals, and cause dehydration.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a doctor to understand this and I\u2019m sure you can agree with this \u2013 it just makes logical sense!\n\nClean water is an essential nutrient and you can\u2019t be replaced with something \u201clike\u201d it.\n\nClean Water Is Magical\n\nWater is magical and has so many health benefits.\n\nWhatever health ailment you have, drinking more water will help reduce the problem and could potentially just fix it.\n\nThe simple fact that it:\n\nimproves your blood volume and viscosity\n\nflushes out toxins and keeps your organs healthier\n\nboosts your energy levels and immune system\n\n\u2026is reason enough to increase your water intake.\n\nLet alone improve skin, weight loss, better muscle contractions, improvement in hormone production, less joint pain, reduction of stress hormones, and so on and so forth.\n\nDrinking more water is guaranteed to help you look and feel younger and allow you to THRIVE every day, rather than \u201cget by\u201d and survive.\n\nSo How Much Should You Drink?\n\nSo this sounds great, but how much water should you drink?\n\nBefore I answer this \u2013 I want to make it clear that you do NOT want to drink tap water because it\u2019s high in toxins such as fluoride and chlorine. You want to drink purified water.\n\nIn regards to how much water you should think \u2014 Well, there are lots of factors\u2026 do you exercise, are in a warm climate, do you sweat, are you taking prescription drugs, what other beverages are you drinking and so forth.\n\nThus, some people will need more water than others.\n\nBut I typically say to people about half your body weight in ounces, especially if you are active.\n\nSo, if you weigh 150 lbs, you have 75 oz. There\u2019s 8 oz to a cup and that comes out to 9 cups daily.\n\nOf course, when I say this to people, they freak out and say:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I can drink that much.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I have that much water, I\u2019ll just be in the bathroom all day, peeing it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t that just wash away all of my minerals?\u201d\n\nSo, let me address these questions.\n\nFirst, the main goal is to just drink more water than you are today. If you\u2019re only drinking 1 cup, try to get 2 cups daily. That\u2019s a good start.\n\nHeck, if because of today\u2019s message the most you ever drink is just 3 cups daily, that\u2019s still better than the 1 lousy cup you have been drinking. Your body will still make big improvements.\n\nMy point here is that just try to have more, that\u2019s it.\n\nAs far as peeing out all the water, yes \u2026 this is true because the water will initially not get absorbed quickly enough.\n\nBut over time it will as your body adjusts to the increase in water consumption.\n\nMore importantly, I suggest you add some REAL salt into your water \u2013 such as Himalayan or Celtic. These salts have dozens of minerals, which will help HYDRATE your body and have the water get absorbed into your cells, rather than get immediately peed out in the bathroom.\n\nAnd this also helps solve the mineral \u201cdilution\u201d you may have from drinking more water.\n\nI also add in a little bit of Lemon juice for taste and you can even sweeten the water with natural Stevia Herb.\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 try to drink half your body weight in ounces.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/my-personal-story-with-kidney-damage-and-a-high-protein-diet-part-2/",
    "content": "This is part two in my article series about high protein diets.\n\nIn part one, I revealed clinical results for:\n\nShort-term, high protein diets and how they affect your kidneys\n\nWhat type of person should NOT eat a high protein diet\n\nThe negative effects of protein on kidney stones\n\nHigh Protein & Kidney Failure\n\nYears ago, I had a business partner. He was a bodybuilder. He was about 20 years older than me. He had more experience than me and I respected and trusted him at the time.\n\nAnd he would always tell me that I need to eat more protein if I want to gain more muscle.\n\nEspecially, \u201clean muscle\u201d \u2026\n\nHe said I need a minimum of 2 grams per pound and 3 grams would be even better.\n\nI weighed about 200 lbs and thus, he wanted me to eat at least 400 grams to 600 grams of protein daily.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of protein. I was eating around 200 grams at the time. 1 gram per pound of bodyweight.\n\nHowever, I decided to go on this journey.\n\nI first doubled my protein and went to 400 grams daily. This was really hard, but I managed to do it for a month.\n\nI decided to eat 50 grams, with 8 meals daily. At least half of them were protein shakes made with whey protein.\n\nAfter 30 days, I noticed weight gain \u2013 which was probably just from the extra calories. However, I was very bloated and tired.\n\nBut, I made a commitment and starting the second month, I went to 600 grams of protein.\n\nTo make a long story short, I stopped two weeks later. So, I was on it for a total of 6 weeks.\n\nBasically, I felt like crap. I was slow and tired. My blood pressure was also higher.\n\nAnd keep in mind that the two major causes of kidney damage are high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels.\n\nAnd having that much protein, especially whey protein \u2013 also increases your blood sugar levels too.\n\nDon\u2019t forget, excess protein converts to sugar and fat.\n\nYet, my business partner did this daily. 100 grams of protein, 7-8x daily. Half from whey protein and the other half from animal sources (chicken, beef, fish, egg whites). He was big and lean.\n\nAnd yes, he took steroids.\n\nFast forward about 10 years later, he ended up dying of kidney disease and kidney failure. He was on dialysis for a few years and finally died.\n\nWas it because of the very high protein diet? I don\u2019t know\u2026.\n\nI was no longer in contact with him for many years.\n\nWho knows what else he was doing.\n\nBut I can guarantee that having that much protein, year after year, for sure added stress to the kidneys.\n\nOne of my original mentors who was a doctor and a bodybuilder was also very much into high protein. He would tell me to eat a tub of cottage cheese every night \u2013 which was about 100 grams of protein.\n\nOf course, I couldn\u2019t do that because I\u2019m lactose intolerant.\n\nBut he did. And years later he also died of kidney failure.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve had a few other bodybuilding clients who have been on very high protein diets, who also have kidney problems.\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not from the steroids and they weren\u2019t taking pain meds either.\n\nThe reality is that you should have enough protein to do its job \u2013 which is to repair and build.\n\nAnything extra will just put stress on your organs and turn into body fat.\n\nIn fact, too much protein will also increase oxidation and thus, does the opposite and decreases protein synthesis.\n\nSo, how much protein should you be eating daily?\u2026 Assuming you\u2019re working out with weights?\n\nI honestly think about 1 gram per pound of bodyweight is all you need. So if you weigh 200 lbs, eat 200 grams.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s coming from good quality protein \u2013 such as whole eggs, bison, salmon and of course, whey protein isolate is one of the highest biological values. Then you probably need even less.\n\nIf you\u2019re taking lots of steroids and similar drugs, you can eat a little bit more.\n\nAnd the average person who doesn\u2019t exercise much, they just need about half of that \u2013 0.5 grams per pound of weight.\n\nWhat Are The Best Protein Sources?\n\nI\u2019ve done an article about this in the past. The best proteins would be pasteurized whole eggs, wild-caught salmon, grass-fed bison, and grass-fed beef.\n\nI think chicken is a crappy source of protein. I\u2019ve done an entire article about this and there\u2019s a link below at the end of the article.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of dairy because milk is for babies and cow milk is for baby cows.\n\nHowever, small amounts of whey isolate from grass-fed cows are okay. It has the least amount of fat, sugar, and lactose.\n\nForget the cheap, gas-producing, Whey Concentrate. It\u2019s used in many products to save money. So, read the labels and avoid whey concentrate.\n\nAnd the best vegan source of protein would be non-GMO white rice protein.\n\nPersonally, over the past few years, I\u2019ve lowered the amount of protein I eat, especially from animal sources. I have probably half my protein from vegetable sources now and the animal protein is only of the highest quality.\n\nAnd I haven\u2019t noticed any negative changes in my body. And I have more energy.\n\nHigh protein diets will put extra stress on your kidneys, definitely if you already have kidney problems.\n\nThey do increase your risk of kidney stones.\n\nExcess protein will simply turn into sugar and body fat.\n\nYou only need a maximum of 1 gram of quality protein, per pound of bodyweight.\n\nFor maximum protein synthesis, eat no more than 40 grams per meal. So, if you\u2019re eating 200 grams, that would be spread over 5 meals. Less protein more often is better.\n\nThe better quality of protein, the less protein you need.\n\nHigher and higher protein diets will eventually cause a decrease in protein synthesis and increase oxidation \u2013 you do NOT want this.\n\nVery high protein diets also accelerate aging and can cause earlier mortality and death.\n\nNow, below if I have other important links about proteins:\n\nWhy Chicken Is Worthless & Bad Protein\n\nEverything You Want & Need To Know About Protein Powders\n\nHow To Use Whey Protein For Maximum Muscle and Fat Loss\n\nBest Time To Have Whey Protein For Max Muscle & Fat Loss\n\nEat NO Protein To Gain MORE Muscle\n\nWhat To Eat On Protein Fasting Days For Gaining Muscle & Losing Fat\n\nBest Vegan Protein Powders \u2013 For Health, Muscle & Fat Loss",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/food-diet/is-red-meat-good-or-bad-for-you-the-final-conclusion/",
    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is about red meat \u2013 is red meat good or bad for you \u2013 the final conclusion.\n\nOne main reason I started creating content, writing blogs, and making videos is to help give more clarity and reduce the confusion and misinformation about health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nNot just for you and my viewers, but starting for myself.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s always conflicting information and bias from experts, doctors, researchers, and everyone in between.\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to summarize today\u2019s topic and make it short \u2013 since this can be a very long and debatable topic.\n\nFirst, we need to clarify what meat is \u2026 and it\u2019s generally referenced to be RED meat, such as a cow. However, it can also include bison, lamb, elk, and similar animals.\n\nThus, it\u2019s not poultry or pork or fish. Even though most people will throw in pork into the \u201cmeat\u201d category.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to focus on red meat\u2026\n\nWhat Type Of Meat \u2013 The Problem Begins\n\nWhen doing research, and you hear about anything bad that\u2019s related to meat consumption \u2014 such as heart problems, blood sugar regulation problems, and other health issues \u2014 the TYPE of meat includes everything and this is where the problem starts.\n\nYes, it includes cows. But it also includes hot dogs, cold cuts, salami, and other processed meats.\n\nObviously, anyone will know or should know, that a processed hotdog is nowhere near as healthy as a steak.\n\nThe hotdog is unhealthy because it has a ton of other junk in there.\n\nAnd if we focus on only the cow, we have two different types of cow or beef.\n\nThe first and more common and \u201cconventional\u201d cow \u2026 is the factory-farmed, jailed up and confined, given unnatural foods such as grains, soy and chicken, antibiotics and drugs, and thus, it\u2019s very processed.\n\nThen we have the second, more rare and expensive, \u201cgrass-fed, pasture-raised\u201d organic meats, which have been naturally fed and raised organically, without drugs and hormones. They don\u2019t have any artificial chemicals added.\n\nWhen researchers say negative things about meat, they do NOT distinguish between any of these two types of meats and factors.\n\nThe processed versus the natural.\n\nObviously, someone eating hotdogs all day or even processed, factory-farmed, drugged-up meats is going to be a lot more unhealthy, than someone eating grass-fed bison \u2013 as I do.\n\nThus, not all red meat has the same health effects \u2013 positives or negatives\n\nIn fact, in a massive review of 20 studies including 1,218,380 individuals found that processed meat was associated with an increased risk of heart and blood sugar problems. However, no association was found for unprocessed red meat. [1,2]\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the saying, \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d.\n\nHowever, maybe the more accurate saying should be, \u201cyou are what your food ate\u201d.\n\nAnd this includes vegetables too \u2013 those grown with and without pesticides and other harmful toxins.\n\nLife-Style Matters Too\n\nAnother issue with clinical studies is that they don\u2019t take into account the person\u2019s lifestyle.\n\nFor example, someone eating fast foods, hamburgers, hotdogs, and so forth, probably isn\u2019t the most healthy person. They aren\u2019t exercising and eating a balanced diet or living a healthy lifestyle.\n\nMost likely, the majority of their food consumption is from processed foods.\n\nThus, they are unhealthy \u2013 regardless of whether they eat meat or not.\n\nSo, why blame the meat for the illness when it should be the person\u2019s lifestyle, habits, and so forth.\n\nAs stated earlier, I can go on and on about this topic. I can debate both sides.\n\nI can speak about plant-based diets, vegan and carnivore diets \u2014 the pros and cons of each.\n\nI can speak in detail about how correlation doesn\u2019t equal causation.\n\nI can dig deeper into various randomized studies.\n\nEven compare the different types of red meats and then compare them even deeper to other protein sources such as fish, eggs, poultry, protein powders, and so forth.\n\nHowever, that\u2019ll just cause you to zone out, get bored, or maybe even more confused \u2014 which is the exact opposite of my goal.\n\nSo, let me just get right down to it and let you know what I do and what I suggest you might consider doing for yourself and your family.\n\nI eat almost all protein sources.\n\nI do NOT eat pork or shellfish because I think they\u2019re poor quality protein sources, are linked to negative health issues and many religions have stated this for thousands of years.\n\npasture-raised chicken and whole eggs\n\nProtein powders from vegetable proteins such as rice and pea\u2026 as well as pasture-raised whey isolate powder in small amounts.\n\nAnd I eat red meat \u2014 grass-fed and finished, pasture-raised bison and elk. I prefer these two red types of meat to cows because these animals are genetically better and healthier.\n\nYes, the above costs more money. But, my health and future is my #1 priority.\n\nI\u2019ve set a very high standard for myself when it comes to health and I think you should too.\n\nBesides, quality is more important than quantity.\n\nSo I would rather you ate less animal protein but from higher quality sources.\n\nAnd if money IS an issue and you still want to increase your protein amount, then get it from powdered sources as well.\n\nThis is more towards the athletes and bodybuilders who are so protein-focused.\n\nYou can do grass-fed whey isolate or vegetable protein powders \u2013 rice is my favorite, pea and hemp are also good.\n\nIn my opinion, there\u2019s nothing wrong with high-quality red meat.\n\nHowever, you also probably shouldn\u2019t be eating pounds if it daily, either\u2026. Like some bodybuilders and weightlifters do.\n\nLastly, if you want to have the occasional hotdog or hamburger for whatever reason \u2013 then go ahead.\n\nBut do me and yourself a favor and enjoy yourself. Do NOT feel guilty about it.\n\nJust don\u2019t make it a habit, either.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479151\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23497300",

    "content": "Did you know that statistics show that most of the weight gain for people happens around the holidays?\u2026\n\nSo, today I\u2019m going to reveal 5 proven, simple, and easy to implement tactics that\u2019ll allow you to still enjoy your holiday eating, without gaining any weight.\n\nOr at the very least, minimizing the weight gain.\n\nBy the way, what you\u2019ll discover today you can use at any time when faced with some social event that\u2019ll tempt you with lots of yummy foods \u2014 whether it\u2019s the holidays, birthdays, parties, and so forth.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll start from the minute you wake up in the morning.\n\nThe first thing I want you to do is to skip breakfast and not eat in the morning or even at lunch. Like a mini intermittent fast.\n\nGo ahead and have some coffee or tea and of course as much water as you\u2019d like. Do not go to some coffee shop and get a 300 calorie coffee.\n\nNo sugars or calories. Thus, continue the fasting.\n\nAfter skipping breakfast, I want you to exercise. This is for two reasons:\n\nI want you to burn some extra calories.\n\nMore importantly, I want you to improve your hormones, which will allow you to be able to eat more food later, without it converting to body fat.\n\nIdeally, you would go lift some weights and thus, do some resistance exercise. These can be dumbbells, barbells, cables, machines, or even your own body weight.\n\nDo this for at least 20 minutes.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to lift weights, then go for a brisk walk.\n\nRemember, the more muscles you use, especially with your lower body, the more carbs you can eat and the more calories you\u2019ll burn.\n\nAnd please don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t have the time or desire or whatever. Just go for a quick walk at the very least. Go make some phone calls while doing your walk or listen to some of my YouTube videos and feed your brain.\n\n3. DRINK Dr. Sam\u2019s LEMONADE\n\nAfter your exercise session, continue with the fasting, and just drink water. IF you\u2019re hungry, drink my special, appetite suppressant, anti-aging Lemonade.\n\nIt tastes great, it\u2019ll immediately turn off your appetite and it\u2019s good for your health. Here\u2019s another link to the simple recipe.\n\nNow let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re going to the holiday party. You haven\u2019t eaten anything all day. You may or may not feel good \u2013 this depends on the person and it varies from one to the next.\n\nHowever, I do NOT want you to show up to the party starving. Because the minute you start to smell the yummy foods, your stomach and brain will turn on and you\u2019ll want to eat everything in sight.\n\nInstead, pop some mints. And not the sugar-free ones. Just take one regular, sugar Altoid.\n\nIt\u2019s just 5 calories. But the tiny bit of real sugar will feed your brain and the peppermint will turn off your appetite.\n\nIf you get hungry again, just take another Altoid. Again, it\u2019s only 5 calories \u2013 however, it\u2019ll prevent you from going nuts and eating everything in sight.\n\n5. Take A Carb & Fat Blocking Fiber Supplement\n\nNow, about 30 minutes before you eat your meal or you begin \u201cfeasting\u201d, take a carb and fat blocking supplement. Yes, there are special fibers and herbs that actually BLOCK the sugar, carb, and fat calories from being absorbed.\n\nAnd what\u2019s not absorbed, won\u2019t turn into weight gain or body fat.\n\nThe solution I take is CHEATmeals. It has the most potent carb and fat blockers, plus digestive enzymes to help you digest the big meal you\u2019ll be having.\n\nIMPORTANT: Enjoy Your Meal & Don\u2019t Stress\n\nFinally, when it\u2019s time to go to eat, enjoy yourself. I don\u2019t want you to feel guilty or stressed about the foods you eat.\n\nTry to practice some self-control and don\u2019t eat so much that you feel bloated and sick. This includes what you drink.\n\nAnd if you eat too much, no problem. Go for a walk after your meal and then the next few days, eat less food, and try to walk or exercise a little more.\n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up.\n\nJust make better and healthier decisions for the rest of the week and get back to your regular, healthy lifestyle.\n\nRemember, getting stressed out will cause negative changes in your hormones and will quickly cause weight and fat gain.\n\nThe holidays can be stressful times. So, don\u2019t add to it by being a jerk to yourself or others.\n\nBe kind, smile, be appreciative, and be grateful for what you have.\n\nPlease visit the special link. I wish you, your family and friends a very happy and healthy holiday season.\n\nImportant \"Carb, Sugar & Fat BLOCKING\" Shortcut\n\nOne of the biggest problems with \"dieting\" is the fact you can't eat some of your favorite foods.\n\nThis is especially difficult when you go out - such as restaurants, parties, the holidays, date-night and other social events.\n\nHowever, the great news is that there's a special way that you can actually BLOCK those \"bad\" calories (sugars, carbs and fats) from your favorite foods from being absorbed.\n\nThe end result is \"you can have your cake and eat it too\"... And STILL lose weight! It's utilizing ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today you\u2019ll discover everything you need to know about Coconut vs MCT oil.\n\nI\u2019ve received a lot of questions about it and mainly, people are confused. And I totally agree and understand.\n\nSo I\u2019ve simplified the information, so it\u2019s easy to digest and apply.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve been taking coconut and MCT oil for over 35 years. WAY before it became cool or popular.\n\nInitially, it was about gaining muscle and losing fat at the same time. Then it was for both gut and brain health.\n\nI\u2019ll talk about all of this today and more specifically:\n\nWhat are Coconut and MCT oils?\n\nWhat are the differences?\n\nWhich are the best forms and what to avoid?\n\nHow to best use each one and when\n\nCoconut oil is the oil extracted from the kernel of the coconut.\n\nIt\u2019s fat, not protein or carbohydrate.\n\nCoconut oil contains more than 50% of its fat being different types of MCTs\n\nCoconut oil is primarily saturated fat. This is why it\u2019s solid at room temperature, while non-saturated fats such as olive oil are liquid.\n\nHowever, Coconut oil contains no trans fats or cholesterol\u2026 unlike other saturated fats.\n\nThis is why many people consider coconut oil to be healthy fat.\n\nSo, it\u2019s different from other saturated fats found in animal proteins \u2014 such as eggs for example \u2014 which do contain cholesterol.\n\nBy the way, this does NOT mean that dietary saturated fats or cholesterol is bad for you. I\u2019ve done articles about this topic in the past.\n\nSo, I won\u2019t cover it today.\n\nSome of the benefits of coconut oil are that it\u2019s antimicrobial, antiviral, and antibacterial. Which means it has properties for:\n\nKilling harmful bacteria and other pathogens 1\n\nIncreasing your \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol and lipoprotein 2\n\nIt can help you lose fat, especially around your waistline 3\n\nPromoting skin health when used topically 4\n\nIn fact, this was the original reason I took coconut oil over 35 years ago.\n\nI had bacterial problems in my gut and I started taking\n\nMCT stands for \u201cmedium-chain triglycerides\u201d.\n\nThere are four types of MCTs:\n\nI\u2019ll talk about the benefits, pros, and cons of each and which ones I avoid and those that I take and for what reason\u2026 in just a minute.\n\nMCTs are found in coconut oil as stated earlier, but also Palm oil.\n\nSomething to note is that almost all the fats you consume and hear about, such as Olive oil, nuts, avocados, animal fats, and so forth are \u201clong-chain triglycerides\u201d.\n\nWhile MCT is a medium-chain.\n\nWhat separates MCTs from other types of fats is in how they\u2019re processed by the body\u2014they\u2019re not absorbed in the same exact fashion as other fat sources.\n\nMCTs are directly shuttled to the liver to rapidly be used for energy both in the form of fat and ketones.\n\nMCTs can directly enter the mitochondria, the cell\u2019s powerhouse, and help it produce energy.\n\nSo to really simplify all of this, MCTs are fats that get used for faster energy like carbohydrates.\n\nThus, they also have less of a chance to get stored as body fat, when compared to regular long-chain fats such as olive oil and other fats.\n\nMCTs also help with brain and cognitive functions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, because of the ketones and the improvement in blood sugar.5\n\nWhat Are The Main Differences?\n\nMCT is a more refined version or more of an \u201cextract\u201d of Coconut oil.\n\nMCT is only a medium-chain triglyceride, while Coconut oil is BOTH medium and long.\n\nMCT is liquid at room temperature, while Coconut is solid.\n\nYou can cook with coconut oil, but I suggest you shouldn\u2019t with MCT\u2026 even though some people do.\n\nMCT is better for energy and brain health, while Coconut is better for gut health.\n\nCoconut oil contains mainly lauric acid (C12) MCT, while you can get specific versions of MCT \u2013 such as caprylic acid (C8), which is what I take. More on this in a minute.\n\nWHAT Is The Best FORM Of Coconut Oil\n\nIf you\u2019re going to cook with coconut oil, then it\u2019s better to go with REFINED because it has a higher heating point of 400 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhile UNREFINED, VIRGIN is good up to 350 degrees.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to eat it raw, the unrefined/Virgin has a more coconut and richer taste. The refined has less scent and flavor.\n\nWHEN Is The Best TIME To Use Coconut Oil?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, there is no best time.\n\nHOW Should You Best Use Coconut Oil?\n\nYou can eat it raw or cook with it \u2013 up to you.\n\nWHAT Is The Best FORM Of MCT Oil?\n\nAs stated earlier there are 4 kinds of MCT oils. I\u2019ll tell you my favorite in a minute.\n\ncaproic acid (C6) \u2013 this is the shortest MCT with 6 carbons. It does convert to ketones quickly, but it\u2019s bitter and causes stomach problems, gas and diarrhea.\n\ncaprylic acid (C8) \u2013 is a little longer, with 8 carbons. It converts to ketones the fastest, so it\u2019s good for energy, brain health, decreasing appetite, sugar cravings, and fat burning.\n\nKeep in mind that regular coconut oil is only about 3% C8.\n\ncapric acid (C10) \u2013 is even longer, with 10 carbons. Not much research on this as far as benefits, other than it might boost your immune system and decrease fungus. It does cause stomach issues. It\u2019s cheaper to produce than C8.\n\nlauric acid (C12) \u2013 this is the longest MCT with 12 carbons. I actually consider this more of a LONG chain, rather than a medium-chain. It\u2019s the least effective for ketones, but more effective for antimicrobial and antibacterial.\n\nNow, I personally only use the Caprylic Acid C8. It has the most MCT benefits and the least stomach issues.\n\nBut, make sure to search out specific MCT with ONLY Caprylic Acid C8.\n\nMost MCT oils use a combination to save money. Most of it is C10 and C12.\n\nI prefer products with glass bottles instead of plastic for oils.\n\nWHEN Is The Best TIME To Use MCT Oil?\n\nI use it first thing in the morning and also before my workout and sometimes before bed.\n\nI only use 1 teaspoon at a time. That\u2019s all you need in my opinion. Too much will cause stomach issues.\n\nHOW Should You Best Use MCT Oil\n\nI do use it for more of an energy source. Even though, I personally don\u2019t feel anything.\n\nI mean, I\u2019ll be honest with you \u2026 I\u2019ll take Body Brain Energy in the morning and holy crap, I\u2019m flying high all day long.\n\nI\u2019m super focused, crazy amounts of energy, no jitters, no rapid heart rate, it contains nootropics, it dramatically improves your mitochondria, it\u2019s good for your body, muscles, and brain.\n\nContains only 10 mg of natural caffeine from organic green tea extract and it does NOT affect my sleep.\n\nI love it for energy, brain health, muscle stamina, and all-around anti-aging benefits.\n\nHowever, I still take MCT oil for some of the ketone benefits.\n\nAnd in all honesty, it\u2019s just more for insurance reasons.\n\nSo now you know the differences between Coconut oil and MCT oil. The pros and cons of each. How to best use each one and the best forms.\n\nThese days, I probably only take 1 teaspoon of MCT C8 in the morning or before my workout for the ketones and brain health.\n\nI only use about \u00bd of a tablespoon of coconut for the antimicrobial, antiviral, and antibacterial benefits for better gut health. Along with my pre and probiotics.\n\nAltogether, I\u2019m taking in about 100 calories from Coconut and MCT oil.\n\nIt\u2019s not much. As I said, I don\u2019t really feel it and if I take too much MCT, it causes me stomach problems.\n\nFor energy, I just take Body-Brain Energy.\n\nI also take about 1 tablespoon of Udo\u2019s Oil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Fish oil daily. So, that\u2019s about another 400 fat calories.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fat found in my proteins and some other foods.\n\nSo, I estimate about 25%-30% of my diet is from fat.\n\nAnd the remaining 70% is about 50/50 protein and carbs.\n\nHence, I\u2019m more of an iso-caloric diet. Or in the old days, a zone-diet.\n\nAbout \u2153 of my calories are from each of the 3 macronutrients. \u2014 proteins, carbs, and fats.\n\nThe ratios do change on different days, workout vs non-workout.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve got some very important information and links on what we spoke about today and how to improve your energy levels, brain health, and muscle stamina.\n\nPlease visit them as it pertains to today\u2019s topic and in helping you achieve your health, fitness, and longevity goals \u2026 in the least amount of time, effort, and money \u2026 and most importantly, have fun in the process.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC444260\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19437058\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636220\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15724344\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30367958/",

    "content": "Today we\u2019re halfway through our 10 multi-part series about the \u201c10 Biggest Myths & Lies About Weight Loss\u201d.\n\nToday\u2019s Myth #5 is that Eating Fat Makes You Fat\n\nIn the 1980\u2019s, everyone was completely against eating fat because they thought that eating it would quickly get turned into or stored as body fat. So that started the high carbohydrate, \u201cfat-free\u201d dieting craze \u2014 which as history has shown, didn\u2019t work.\n\nOne reason people think that eating fat makes you fat, is because every gram of fat you eat, has 9 calories. While the same 1 gram of protein and carbs has only 4 calories, that\u2019s more than HALF the calories.\n\nSo fat calories are very dense and thus, the real problem is that you end up eating MORE calories \u2013 not that the actual fat you eat turns into body fat.\n\nA second reason that people think that eating fat makes you fat, is because it\u2019s usually combined with high carbohydrate foods. Usually junk or processed foods. And the truth is, it\u2019s usually the best TASTING foods \u2014 such as pastries, pizza, french fries, ice cream and pretty much anything that\u2019s fried.\n\nHowever, the truth is that eating healthy fats actually INCREASES your metabolism and burns fat, because fats improve your hormones.\n\nAnd as you\u2019ve heard me say over and over again, the way you look and feel \u2013 including your body fat, is determined by your genes, which is controlled by your hormones!\n\nFor example, coconut oil increases your thyroid production and also helps increase testosterone levels.\n\nMCT oils give you energy like carbs and have a very hard time being converted to body fat.\n\nMacadamia nut oil and extra virgin olive oil both help boost your metabolism.\n\nWhat you want to stay away from are hydrogenated and trans fats, which are typically found in pastries, junk, and processed foods.\n\nYou always want to avoid the so-called \u201chealthy\u201d fats such as vegetable and seed oils like soybean, canola, sunflower, corn and cottonseed oil because they\u2019re high in Omega 6 fats and Linoleic acid \u2014 which cause inflammation and the slowing of your metabolism.\n\nHowever, the hardest part about all of this and what to eat and not eat is that it\u2019s very difficult to eat like this all the time because these \u201cunhealthy fats\u201d are found in anything that tastes good. \u2014 especially in the foods you eat when you go out to dinner, or at parties, family events, the holidays and so forth.\n\nSo in these situations, I suggest you \u201ccheat\u201d and you go ahead and enjoy yourself, but just make sure you take a fat and carbohydrates/sugar BLOCKER.\n\nThese \u201cmiracle fibers and herbs\u201d actually block the unhealthy fats and sugars that are in these \u201cyummy\u201d foods. So I take these \u201cblockers whenever I know I\u2019m not going to be able to eat healthily.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing because I still get to enjoy some of my favorite foods, WITHOUT feeling guilty or worrying about getting fatter.\n\nAnd you can learn more about these naturally fat and carb BLOCKERS by clicking the link below.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

As a quick reminder, weight loss myth #1 was that \u201cAll Calories Are Equal\u201d and Lie #2 was that \u201cCarbs Make You Fat\u201d\n\nToday I\u2019ll talk about myth #3, that \u201cdiet foods help you lose weight\u201d\n\nAbout 25+ years ago there was a huge selling and marketing for \u201cdiet foods\u201d \u2014 such as non-fat diet foods that were super high in sugar calories\u2026 which everyone started eating all the time, including myself .. .and that just made us fatter.\n\nThen later came the \u201cno sugar\u201d foods that were full of artificial sweeteners. These didn\u2019t work either because of the negative impact again on your hormones, your gut bacteria, receptors in your brain that actually turned ON more cravings and so forth.\n\nAnd these days, there are so many foods that are marketed as \u201chealthy\u201d because for example, they are \u201cbaked with vegetable oils\u201d instead of being \u201cFried\u201d. But this makes no difference because it\u2019s the same calories and they\u2019re high in omega 6 oils, which causes negative changes in your hormones, inflammation and so forth \u2014 all causing weight gain.\n\nOr energy drinks or healthy \u201cvitamin water\u201d, which are again \u2014 just loaded with sugars and calories.\n\nOr even \u201chealthy protein bars\u201d which are again, just loaded with sugars, bad proteins, and fats. Sure, it\u2019s a little better than a Snickers, but the end result is typically the same.\n\nUnfortunately, 95% of these foods can\u2019t be trusted. They are NOT healthier for you.\n\nSadly, the FDA allows over 1000 \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients\u2026 that do NOT need to be listed on packages or the ingredients\u2026 that are known to cause weight gain, increase cravings and simply designed to get you to EAT MORE, so the food industry makes MORE money off of you.\n\nThey\u2019re worse than the pharmaceutical companies.\n\nBasically, do your best to eat foods in their natural states. Foods that don\u2019t come in a box or are processed. Foods that \u201cgo bad\u201d and spoil quickly, usually means their more natural, fewer preservatives and thus, less \u201cchemicals\u201d that\u2019ll cause you to have food addictions.\n\nAgain, this all goes back to your hormones, which controls your genes. \u201cSkinny\u201d people have better \u201cfat burning genes\u201d, simply because they have better \u201cfat burning HORMONES\u201d.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "There are certainly many different diet programs out there that promise to help you lose the weight. However, while most diet programs are built on quick weight loss promises that tend to not pan out in the long run, others are built on the theory that this is a diet you can eat for the rest of your life.\n\nOne of the more interesting diet trends in the past several years is the Raw Food Diet. This diet program has come under more scrutiny since more people are trying it based on the belief that it is healthy and the restrictions are not based on calorie intake, but on eating in the same fashion as our pre-historic ancestors.\n\nWhat is the Raw Food Diet?\n\nBasically, you eat foods that are raw and not cooked. The theory is that raw foods contain enzymes and many nutrients that break down when cooked. The argument is that these particular enzymes help the body properly digest the food and absorb the nutrients that otherwise would not be present. The result is that your body gains more nutritional value from the food itself and you will lose weight in the process because you will naturally eat fewer calories.\n\nWe actually eat many fruits and vegetables in their raw state, so such foods are not foreign to our bodies. Those on the raw food diet tend to eat healthy, good tasting food in quantities that do not create issues with the body as well. Plus, eating foods that are raw means consuming less processed foods and sugars which can help people lose the excess weight.\n\nCertain foods should definitely be eaten raw and this avoids foods that have fat added in the cooking process as well. For many vegetarians, eating raw foods is a large part of their diet and many lead healthy lives in the process.\n\nThe very theory that those who promote the raw food diet propose is simply not true. In reality, cooked food not only keeps most of the nutrition in place, it is far easier for the body to digest the food in that manner. This is because the nutrients and elements in the food are broken down into smaller parts so that our bodies can readily digest the food.\n\nRaw food on the other hand, particularly meats for example take far longer for the body to digest properly. While some foods do retain more nutrients in their raw state, people will generally find themselves feeling tired because it takes more energy to digest the raw food than if it were cooked.\n\nThoughts To Leave You With\n\nWhile adding more raw foods, particularly fruits and vegetables to your diet can be a very healthy choice, going totally without cooked foods may not be the answer for you. Plus, there are raw foods that are not very healthy and consuming too much of them will not take off any excess weight.\n\nSo, the answer is striking the right balance of both raw and cooked foods so that you can really enjoy a healthy diet.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

With that said, let\u2019s move on to ..\n\nRule #5: Best TIME To Eat MORE & Still Lose Weight!\n\nYou MUST try your best to eat your protein/carbohydrate meals during the first half of the day and your protein/fat meals during the second half of the day.\n\nThis again has to do with managing your insulin and cortisol levels. But also, keep in mind that carbs are used for quick and instant energy.\n\nWhen you have carbs during the early part of the day, you can utilize the calories for the rest of the day, since you will be active. But when eating carbs late at night and going to bed afterwards, the carb calories will get stored mostly as fat.\n\nThere is an exception to the rule in that immediately after exercising, it\u2019s a good idea to have a protein/carb meal without any fat. I know many people exercise after they leave work, later in the day \u2026 so having some carbs after your workout along with protein, will be beneficial and help speed up recovery because it will fill up glycogen and liver stores and get your muscles ready for the next workout.\n\nBut just don\u2019t over do the carbs!\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019d like to add one very important note to all this. Most people think it\u2019s bad eating late in the day, at nights or before bed. So, what they try and do is stop eating many hours before sleep and then will \u201chopefully\u201d have breakfast.\n\nBut the problem with this is that (A), this theory is WRONG and (B), because you won\u2019t be eating for many hours (before bed and during sleep \u2026 around 10-12 hours or more without any food), your body will slow down, reduce thermogenics (body heat and fat burning) and you\u2019ll go in a semi-hibernation state.\n\nWhat Does All This Mean To You?\n\nFor about half the day (the 10-12 hours you don\u2019t eat), your body is slow and hence, NOT burning fat, but actually figuring out ways to HOLD ON TO FAT (by increasing cortisol for example) because it thinks \u201coh no, he doesn\u2019t know when the next meal will come and we better slow things down, so we don\u2019t burn up all this fat or he might die from STARVATION!\u201d\n\nDoes this make sense? It\u2019s basically how things worked and still do, because of the \u201ccave-man\u201d days.\n\n[message type=\u201dsimple\u201d]NOTE: For people who tend to have a bad habit of \u201cskipping meals\u201d like breakfast and hence, going more then 3-4 hours WITHOUT food (which slows down the metabolism), I urge you to try Lean Optimizer\u00ae. It will naturally and safely INCREASE your metabolism and best of all, burn specifically STUBBORN fat areas \u2013 such as waist, \u201clove handles\u201d, hips, lower body, etc.\n\nBe A BABY & Eat ALL Day Long!\n\nForget the fact that babies are chubby and fat. That\u2019s simply because of their hormones. But in reality, our bodies are made to eat all day long. The more OFTEN you eat, the faster your metabolism becomes because every time you DO eat, your body has to turn \u201cON\u201d again and digest food and hence, burn calories.\n\nBUT, the secret is not to eat junk before going to bed. Eat 5-8 times a day, but mainly just \u201cmini-meals\u201d. Of course before bed, make sure you stay AWAY from the carbs \u2013 BUT STILL EAT something (even if it\u2019s just 100 calories of food!).\n\nHere are some good \u201clate night snacks\u201d for your to consider.\n\nLow-fat yogurt (NOT non-fat and with NO fruit)\n\nLow-fat cottage cheese (NOT non-fat and with NO fruit)\n\nSmall protein shake with flaxseed oil or almonds.\n\n1 or 2 hard boiled eggs (no more than 2-3x a week)\n\nSalad with some egg whites and lots of vegetables (little bit of extra virgin olive oil for dressing).\n\nBasically, very little carbs, some protein and fat. Keep the calories less than 200, so it slightly fills you up, but not bloat you and make it hard to sleep (even eating 50 calories is helpful in keeping your metabolism up and active).\n\nWhat If You Are Going To Eat Out & It\u2019s Late At Night?\n\nIf you end up going out with friends and having a late night dinner or end up cheating for whatever reason, then take 3-4 capsules of CHEATmeals before or with the meal to block the carbs and fats from being absorbed, thus preventing weight gain.\n\nCHEATmeals was developed not so you can \u201ccheat\u201d on all your meals and pig out all the time, but just SOME of the time, when you can\u2019t control it (a party, business, traveling, etc.). It\u2019s too strong to use all the time.\n\nDon\u2019t Cut Calories, & STILL Lose Weight!\n\nYou see, with the above rule (and previous ones), you don\u2019t even have to reduce calories to lose weight because by simply changing your eating HABITS, you will immediately condition your body to BURN FAT without losing valuable muscle!\n\nBy also utilizing a powerful \u201cMulti-Mode\u201d fat burner like Lean Optimizer\u00ae, combined with a carb and fat blocker like CHEATmeals\u2122 \u2013 You will FURTHER accelerate fat loss, WITHOUT having to decrease calories, starve yourself or spend hours in the gym. You can enjoy life and your new body!",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss/6-habits-thatll-quickly-make-you-fat-cause-weight-gain/",
    "content": "There are lots of things you can do to lose weight. However, if you keep doing the WRONG things that make you fat, it makes the whole process so much harder.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to \u201csabotage\u201d your weight loss efforts, by unknowingly making the following 6, daily habits that\u2019ll quickly make you fat.\n\nSo let\u2019s save you time and effort, help speed up the weight loss process and more importantly, keep the fat off long-term!\n\n1 \u2013 Eating While Distracted\n\nEating while watching TV is probably the #1 cause of eating excessive calories.\n\nIn fact, research by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition revealed that distractions results in a person eating 50 percent more calories.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, when you\u2019re eating and watching TV or on your laptop or something else distracting, you\u2019re not pay attention to what you\u2019re eating. You\u2019re focused on the show, so you just keep eating, snacking and drinking.\n\nYou\u2019re not \u201cmindful\u201d\u2026 So watch TV without any snacks or foods, unless it\u2019s vegetables with NO dressing.\n\n2 \u2013 Eating Too Quickly\n\nMost of us are in a rush and we\u2019re not chewing your foods properly. This causes stomach problems, gas, bloat, acid reflux and weight gain.\n\nAnd one of the reasons you gain weight is because 20 minutes of eating, typically signals your brain that you\u2019re full. When you eat slowly, you\u2019ll eat LESS food during that time\u2026. Because your brain shuts off your appetite.\n\n3 \u2013 Drinking Your Calories\n\nDrinking your calories is a big problem because it only takes a couple of minutes to have juice, soda, a \u201cshake\u201d or any other liquid that\u2019s loaded with lots of calories.\n\nEating real food causes a \u201cthermogenic\u201d effects, thus increasing your body temperature and metabolism.\n\nAlso, \u201cdrinks\u201d are typically loaded with lots of sugars, which spike up your insulin levels and increase belly fat.\n\n4 \u2013 Not Moving Enough\n\nYour body is made to move. Yet, most people just sit all day \u2014 you\u2019re sitting at work, in your car, behind the computer, while eating and so forth.\n\nYou need to exercise or \u201cmove\u201d daily. Simply taking a brisk, 20-30 minute walk daily will increase your metabolism because it improves your hormones and reduces cravings.\n\n5 \u2013 Not Eating Often Enough\n\nMost people skip breakfast, which isn\u2019t a good idea. But the bigger problem is that most people skip lots of meals and then when they do sit down to finally eat, they are so hungry that they\u2019ll eat anything and make poor eating decisions.\n\nBy eating more often, you\u2019ll have more energy, better blood sugar levels and less cravings and hunger.\n\nAlso, the more often you eat, the faster your metabolism because your body has to \u201cturn on\u201d to digest all the food.\n\nThus, eat smaller meals, more often. This can be 3 regular meals like breakfast, lunch and dinner. Plus 2 smaller \u201csnack\u201d meals.\n\nYou can eat the same calories, but spread it over 5 smaller meals and you\u2019ll lose fat and feel better too.\n\n6 \u2013 Not Drinking Enough Water\n\nMost people don\u2019t drink enough water and thus, are walking around dehydrated. To make it worse, most people are loaded on caffeine products \u2014 coffee, \u201cenergy drinks\u201d, tea and so forth.\n\nWhen you\u2019re dehydrated, your more tired and fatigued. This causes you to move less and burn less calories.\n\nDrinking water, especially cold water, causes a thermogenic effect, similar to eating more meals.\n\nDrinking water, especially before a meal, also reduces hunger pains and cravings.\n\nIt also prevents you from drinking OTHER \u201ccaloric\u201d liquids.\n\nDon\u2019t eat while distracted\n\nDon\u2019t drink your calories\n\nEat more often, with smaller meals\n\nNow, if you\u2019re trying to lose weight and nothing seems to work or you have a hard to keep it off \u2026 especially if you\u2019re over the age of 30, then make sure you click the link below and discover the \u201cBig Weight Loss Scam\u201d and why 93% of diet and exercise programs fail.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.
