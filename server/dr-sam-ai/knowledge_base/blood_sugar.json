    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is for anyone who wants to reverse poor eyesight or prevent eye aging naturally.\n\nIf you wear glasses and notice your prescription getting worse every year, or if you struggle with dry eyes, glare, cataracts, or glaucoma, this is for you.\n\nEven though I\u2019m in my 50s and still have 20/20 vision, I\u2019ve noticed my night vision isn\u2019t what it used to be.\n\nFortunately, the steps I\u2019ve followed for decades can help improve your eyesight or, at the very least, prevent further decline.\n\nMain Causes of Poor Eyesight and Eye Aging\n\nGenetics plays a role, of course. However, aging and mitochondrial decline in the retina are major contributors.\n\nA lack of key nutrients and high sugar intake accelerate eye aging.\n\nSugar damages tiny capillaries throughout the body, reducing blood flow to the eyes.\n\nYour eyes are essentially an extension of your brain.\n\nThis is why poor blood sugar control also impacts cognition and has been linked to \u201ctype 3 diabetes\u201d in Alzheimer\u2019s research.\n\nAt the core of all aging is mitochondrial decline \u2013 the same process that affects your skin, muscles, energy levels, and eyesight.\n\nStep 1: Balance Blood Sugar\n\nHigh blood sugar and insulin resistance are strongly linked to poor eyesight and even blindness.\n\nReduce sugar, avoid processed foods, and limit refined carbohydrates.\n\nRegular exercise helps muscles absorb glucose and improves circulation.\n\nI also use a supplement called Blood Sugar Optimizer with meals to help stabilize glucose levels and support long-term eye health.\n\nStep 2: Stimulate Mitochondria in the Retina\n\nYou can support mitochondrial function using red light therapy at around a 670 nm wavelength.\n\nUse it for about 3 minutes once or twice per week.\n\nKeep your eyes closed \u2013 the light safely penetrates the eyelid and energizes retinal cells.\n\nThis approach supports both eye health and skin health.\n\nAlways consult your doctor before starting any new therapy.\n\nStep 3: Support Eyes With Essential Nutrients\n\nVitamin D3 + K2: Essential for eye and overall health. Take together so calcium goes to bones instead of arteries.\n\nVitamin A: Supports vision and skin health. A typical dose is 10,000 IU three to four times per week.\n\nLutein & Zeaxanthin: Powerful antioxidants that protect against UV damage and oxidative stress. Found in egg yolks and supplements.\n\nB-Complex Vitamins: Support energy production and stress resilience, especially for active individuals.\n\nPersonally, I use Perfect Vitamin D3 + K2, Now Foods Vitamin A, and B-Complex formulas from Jarrow and Life Extension.\n\nStep 4: Get Daily Sunlight\n\nNatural sunlight improves mitochondrial function and helps regulate circadian rhythms.\n\nDon\u2019t stare directly at the sun, but get outside daily \u2013 especially in the morning.\n\nIndoor lifestyles accelerate eye aging.\n\nStep 5: Do Vision Exercises\n\nWhile outside, train your eyes by looking at distant objects like trees, mountains, or faraway buildings.\n\nMost people become nearsighted because they constantly stare at screens up close.\n\nEye exercise: Slowly move your eyes in a circle\u2014top left, top center, top right, bottom right, bottom center, bottom left. Hold each position for 5 seconds and repeat two to three times daily.\n\nEvery 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This reduces digital eye strain and supports distance vision.\n\nStep 6: Improve Blood Flow\n\nPoor circulation accelerates aging everywhere\u2014including the eyes.\n\nBlood delivers oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the retinal tissue.\n\nImprove circulation with walking, exercise, and avoiding smoking.\n\nFor extra support, I use Blood Flow Optimizer, which helps increase nitric oxide and circulation.\n\nStep 7: Take Action Daily\n\nStart with the free basics: sunlight, walking, distance viewing, and eye exercises.\n\nApply the 20-20-20 rule consistently and keep your blood sugar and blood pressure in healthy ranges.\n\nInformation without action changes nothing.\n\nPick one habit today and stay consistent. Small actions compound into long-term eyesight protection.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/6-proven-ways-to-improve-insulin-sensitivity-to-build-muscle-lose-fat/",
    "content": "Over the years, I\u2019ve noticed that people, especially the athletes I\u2019ve coached, those who have the best insulin sensitivity, are able to:\n\nEat more food, especially carbohydrates \u2013 without getting fat\n\nLose more fat or stay leaner, especially around the belly\n\nAnd one common factor that all these people have is really good insulin sensitivity, which is what I want to talk about today.\n\nI personally believe managing your blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity is one of the most important things you can do to live a healthier and longer life \u2013 at the same time, look, and feel younger.\n\nAnd because of this, I have a couple of important links I want to share at the end of today\u2019s article. So make sure you read until the end.\n\nWhat\u2019s Insulin Sensitivity?\n\nSo, what does insulin sensitivity mean?\n\nBasically, when you eat carbs and proteins, especially carbohydrates such as sugars, rice, pasta, bread, fruit, and so forth, your body\u2019s blood sugar will naturally go up.\n\nNow, some foods, that have a higher glycemic index and load, will cause higher blood sugar levels \u2013 such as sugar or cornflakes, for example.\n\nAnyway, as your blood sugar goes up, your pancreas will release insulin, to help regulate the blood sugar back to normal levels.\n\nAnd this goes on all day long.\n\nAging Kills Insulin Sensitivity\n\nUnfortunately, because of aging, genetics, negative hormonal changes, lifestyle, stress, and a poor diet, over time your blood sugar levels go higher and higher. Your body will then release more and more insulin to lower the high blood sugar.\n\nThis, over time, causes insulin resistance.\n\nThis means your body doesn\u2019t feel the insulin just like it used to and your body has to produce even MORE insulin to control your blood sugar.\n\nNow, I\u2019m oversimplifying all of this, but you get the point.\n\nInsulin is an essential hormone and you need it to live. BUT, high levels of insulin cause fat storage, especially around the belly.\n\nAnd as you become more and more insulin resistant, the carbs you eat don\u2019t go into the muscle cells as well. They don\u2019t get used up as energy either.\n\nInstead, they get STORED as body fat.\n\nThe end result is less muscle and more belly fat.\n\nThe people with the best genes tend to have highly sensitive insulin receptors and thus, their body only needs to produce a little bit of insulin. This means less body fat.\n\nAnd, the food gets stored in the muscle cells. This means more energy and more muscle, especially when you exercise. You\u2019ll also be stronger and have more stamina too.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what today\u2019s topic is about \u2013 6 clinically proven ways to increase insulin sensitivity, so you can build more muscle, lose fat, and have more energy.\n\nGetting better, deeper sleep is one of the best things you can do for your health, for optimizing your hormones and improving insulin sensitivity.1-3\n\nI will do an entire article about this topic. However, make sure you\n\nget to sleep before midnight, preferably before 11 pm\n\nget in a regular sleep pattern\n\nkeep your room cool & dark or wear eyeshades, like I do\n\nreduce or eliminate looking at computer or TV screens before bed. Or turn off the blue light or wear blue blocker glasses.\n\nYou can also take specific herbs to help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.\n\n2 \u2013 Lose Fat & Gain Muscle\n\nThe less fat you have, especially belly fat, the higher your insulin sensitivity. Additionally, the more muscle you have, the higher your insulin sensitivity.4-6\n\nSo, try to lose some fat and gain muscle as well. Losing fat is more important. A combination of a better diet and exercise program is best \u2013 and I\u2019ll talk about both of these today.\n\nEating better is a major part of improving insulin sensitivity. Again, I\u2019ll dig deeper into this in a future article, but here are some things to consider. 7-11\n\nEat lower glycemic index and glycemic load carbs and stay away from high ones. This means eating more vegetables, fruits, legumes, and yams.\n\nEat better quality protein and stay away from dairy and protein powders, both tend to spike up blood sugar levels.\n\nEat better fats \u2013 this means to stay away from trans fats and many seed or vegetable oils that are high in omega-6 fats. This includes soybean, canola, corn, sunflower, sesame, and similar oils.\n\nFasting and cyclic ketogenic diets are also very good for improving insulin sensitivity.\n\nEating more soluble fiber is also very good.16-17\n\nAnd simply lowering your carb intake will help as well.\n\nExercise increases insulin sensitivity. In fact, my diabetic athletes require less injectable insulin on days they exercise.\n\nWhen you exercise, the sugar moves into the muscles for storage and promotes an immediate increase in insulin sensitivity, which lasts 2\u201348 hours, depending on the exercise.12-13\n\nMy suggestion is to combine both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. So, 3x weekly lift weights or do resistance exercises for your muscles. This could be Mon, Wed, and Fri.\n\nOn alternate days, Tues, Thurs, and Sat \u2013 do some form of cardio. I prefer a brisk walk a nice bike ride or getting on the treadmill.\n\n20-30 mins daily is all you need.\n\nIf you go too hard, too long, you\u2019ll eventually stress your body and the opposite will happen. Which brings up the next point.\n\nStress is one of the worst things for your body, especially insulin sensitivity. This is why sleep is so important \u2013 it helps reduce so many of your stress hormones.\n\nStress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline cause insulin resistance. This is also why stress causes more belly fat. Stress also lowers testosterone and other youth hormones.14-15\n\nSo, you need to manage your stress and a lot of this first begins in your head and what you think about. Some people just turn something small into something horribly bad and just can\u2019t let go. That\u2019s a lot of ongoing stress.\n\nNot sleeping enough, exercising too much, too hard, too long, and similar physical stressors all cause insulin resistance over time.\n\nYou can also take specific herbs if you want to lower stress hormones like cortisol quickly.\n\nThere are a few, clinically researched supplements that will quickly promote healthy insulin sensitivity, blood sugar levels, and help you build more muscle and lose belly fat.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar is very good. I take 1 tablespoon, 3x daily.\n\nChromium, Alpha Lipoic Acid, and Vanadyl Sulfate have a long, proven history.\n\nHerbs such as Berberine, Cinnamon extract, Bitter Melon, Fenugreek, and Banaba Leaf are all fantastic and very powerful if you take the correct form and dosage.\n\nThere are also about 6-7 essential vitamins and minerals that are typically low in those who have poor insulin sensitivity.\n\nIn fact, I put up a web page with the best ingredients and dosages that are clinically researched to work.\n\nMake sure you at least implement one of the tactics today, so you can start building more muscle and losing more belly fat.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256323/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845795/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10898125\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4038351/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21961463\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832727/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16841858\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17045070\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15789505\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3608918/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15220950\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10683091\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730354\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1605044\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050109/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901089\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19335713",

    "content": "Visceral fat \u2013 also known as \u201cbelly fat\u201d or \u201cpot belly\u201d \u2013 is the dangerous fat that surrounds your internal organs.\n\nUnlike the subcutaneous fat under your skin, visceral fat increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and even hormonal imbalances.\n\nOther than hormones, your diet is the #1 factor in controlling visceral fat.\n\nAt the end of this article, I\u2019ll let you know the real cause of unhealthy visceral fat.\n\nHowever, let me first reveal the 3 worst foods\u2026\n\nAlmost all forms of sugar increase visceral fat because they shoot up your blood sugar, which raises insulin levels and eventually causes insulin resistance. This can lead to diabetes and fatty liver disease.\n\nSugar includes syrups, nectar, soda, and juice. Read the label because most packaged foods contain added sugars.\n\n2. Refined & Packaged Carbohydrates\n\nThese foods taste the best \u2014 and they\u2019re even worse.\n\nPastries, bread, and similar foods have high sugar and fat.\n\nSuper high in calories\n\nMore likely to cause insulin resistance and visceral fat\n\nThere are healthy carbs you can have, such as some fruits, quinoa, oats, yams, legumes, and even small amounts of white rice.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of \u201cbeer belly\u201d?\n\nWell, beer is one of the worst causes of visceral fat due to the extra carbs \u2014 and it\u2019s more estrogenic than other alcohols.\n\nAll alcohol can increase visceral fat over time due to negative hormonal changes and liver stress.\n\nBut if you\u2019re going to drink, wine, vodka, or tequila would be better than beer.\n\nJust remember that alcohol can lower testosterone and increase estrogen, which increases visceral fat.\n\nBottom Line: The Real Cause of Visceral Fat\n\nThe real cause of visceral fat is insulin resistance, caused by negative hormonal changes and aging.\n\nOther contributing factors include:\n\nA diet high in sugar, carbs, and fat (which is most people\u2019s diet)\n\nAll of these cause negative hormonal changes. So, you need to do the opposite.\n\nHow to Reduce Visceral Fat Naturally\n\nExercise more and build muscle\n\nReduce carbs and sugar\n\nIncrease protein and vegetables\n\nPrioritize quality sleep\n\nIntermittent fasting is also very helpful.\n\nI have additional resources and videos on how to dramatically improve blood sugar and insulin sensitivity so you can have a smaller and leaner stomach.\n\nPlease know that visceral fat will only get worse as we get older.\n\nTake action now, make small improvements and you\u2019ll look and feel better \u2014 and live a longer and healthier life.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/5-best-surprising-reasons-to-eat-okra/",
    "content": "Growing up, my mom would put Okra in a lot of the foods and stews she made. The truth is, I never liked the taste. But, she would say, \u201cit\u2019s good for you, eat it\u201d.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s what moms always say.\n\nWhen I asked her \u201cWhy is it good for me?\u201d \u2026 she wouldn\u2019t give any specific answers other than \u201cIt\u2019s a vegetable, they\u2019re all good for you\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, that didn\u2019t tell me anything and it didn\u2019t sell me on the idea of eating Okra.\n\nHowever, today it\u2019s 2025 and I AM going to give you the 5 best and most surprising benefits of Okra that I wish my mom had told me.\n\nOkra Is Great For Blood Sugar\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of Okra is how beneficial it is for blood sugar1.\n\nAnd as you may know from previous articles I\u2019ve done, I think supporting healthy blood sugar levels is a major key to total health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nHaving healthy blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity will help you avoid so many health problems. Healthy blood sugar will help you gain muscle, lose fat, increase your energy levels, and improve mental health. Plus it will help support healthy cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, and on and on.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested in having healthy blood sugar, visit this special link.\n\nPotential Lectin & Gluten Blocker & Anti-Inflammatory\n\nIf you\u2019ve read my articles in the past, you may remember that for well over a decade now, I\u2019ve avoided foods that have lectins and cause inflammation.\n\nIf you have gluten issues, you most likely don\u2019t do well with Lectins as well. In fact, gluten is a form of Lectin.\n\nThe good news is that Okra is rich in raw polysaccharides, a potent compound that has been shown to bind to lectins, effectively blocking their ability to cause harm and inflammation.2,3\n\nSo, for anyone who has joint pain, this is a major benefit as well.\n\nHigh In Fiber & Good For Digestion\n\nMost people do NOT get enough fiber. This is unfortunate because fiber helps with blood sugar, and cholesterol, improves digestion, helps you feel fuller, is great for weight loss, and of course, essential in helping you avoid getting colon cancer.\n\nWell, Okra is high in fiber and low in calories \u2013 so, that\u2019s a double benefit!\n\nGood For Gut Health & Immune System\n\nAdditionally, the type of fiber in Okra and the \u201cslimy\u201d aspect of it, helps improve your gut bacteria and boost your immune system. And if you have ulcers, Okra\u2019s \u201cslimy\u201d benefits help coat the digestive tract and thus, help heal peptic ulcers.\n\nNothing Negative About Okra\n\nThere are lots of other benefits, but I\u2019ve covered the most important ones, which are also backed by science as well as empirical evidence. You know, the kind my mom already knew, but couldn\u2019t express to me.\n\nHowever, one additional benefit I want to mention about Okra is that there\u2019s nothing negative about it. Some vegetables cause stomach problems or may cause other issues, but Okra is just full of benefits and nothing bad.\n\nSo, try to include some okra in your daily diet. You can\u2019t go wrong.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26706676\n\nCederberg BM, Gray GR.

    "content": "I know that these days, people are really pushing the \u201clow carb\u201d or \u201cno carb\u201d or \u201cKetogenic\u201d diets and so forth. People think that carbs are evil and they\u2019re unhealthy \u2026 they make you fat, bad for your brain, and so forth.\n\nThis is utter nonsense.\n\nAs with any type of food, it\u2019s the KIND of carbs, fats, and proteins you eat that can be good or bad for you.\n\nIn regards to carbohydrates, some are good and some are bad for your health, especially your blood sugar, and this is based on two main points.\n\nBoth of these affect how your body reacts to the carbs you eat and thus, how much they increase your blood sugar and insulin levels.\n\nI will give you the specifics about both of these in a future article.\n\nHowever, today I\u2019m going to give you some really great carbohydrates that are healthy for you and your blood sugar levels \u2013 based on having a lower glycemic index AND glycemic load.\n\nThis means no blood sugar spikes, more energy, and less fatigue, and is perfect for weight loss.\n\nBest Carbs For Healthy Blood Sugar Levels\n\nToday I\u2019m going to reveal the 4 best carb sources.\n\nI suggest you eat as many vegetables and greens as you\u2019d like. Ideally, you should eat these FIRST, then proteins and fats, and finally regular carbs.\n\nVegetables are great because they have very few sugars, total carbohydrates, and calories. They are also high in fiber. All of this means healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nJust don\u2019t cook them in oils, or pour dressing and fat all over them. Steamed or raw is best and add some salt and pepper for taste.\n\nBeans are a starchy and complex form of carbohydrate \u2013 similar to rice, bread, etc. However, they are very high in fiber and protein and thus, low in both glycemic index and load, despite being high in carbs.\n\nBlack beans and lentils are my favorites.\n\nThere\u2019s no sugar, so that\u2019s another big benefit. And it\u2019s slow-digesting, so it\u2019ll keep you full longer.\n\nJust keep in mind that it is calorically dense, so keep an eye on your portion size.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s best to cook them in a pressure cooker. It reduces lectins, inflammation, and gas.\n\nMelons are very high in water content, so they tend to be lower in calories. And berries have lower carbohydrates, sugars, and calories, and are high in healthy fiber.\n\nSo, about a cup of these fruits have only about 15 grams or less of carbohydrates, that\u2019s only 60 calories or less.\n\nThey have lots of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nPlus, some berries, such as raspberries have a substance called \u201cellagic acid\u201d, which helps reverse certain aspects of blood sugar problems\n\nFinally, one of my favorite carbs is yams and sweet potatoes, which are very similar. It\u2019s the healthiest out of all the potatoes.\n\nThey do have a slightly higher glycemic index and load than the previously mentioned foods, but they are sweet-tasting, which will satisfy the occasional sweet tooth you may have.\n\nThey also have lots of health benefits, including vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n\nWhat About Oats & Whole Grains?\n\nNow, you\u2019ll notice I didn\u2019t mention oats or \u201cwhole grains\u201d. This is because they are inflammatory and oats tend to be an allergen for many people. I\u2019ve also noticed they increase the stress hormone, cortisol.\n\nThus, why I didn\u2019t mention them and other carbohydrates.\n\nYou can have them but just limit them.\n\nSo the bottom line is that you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of carbs. It\u2019s best you don\u2019t eat them alone.

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to quickly list the 7 best foods that are clinically researched to lower your blood sugar\u2026 And help avoid diabetes.\n\nAs a side benefit, you\u2019ll also lose weight, have more energy, improve your memory and reduce wrinkles.\n\nThere are lots of different diet \u2014 low carbs, high fat, vegetarian, Mediterranean, etc. And, they all work to a certain degree.\n\nHowever, there is one thing all of them have in common and that\u2019s for you to eat vegetables. And the best ones are the green ones.\n\nSpinach, Broccoli, kale and other greens are good sources of antioxidants, vitamins, polyphenols and other ingredients that all help\n\nand decrease sugar levels.1\n\nEat as much as you want.\n\nSteaming is great. But don\u2019t put any dressing on them. A little bit of sea salt, lemon and other spices is perfect.\n\nFish is one of the healthiest foods on the planet \u2013 especially the fatty ones because they are low in heavy metals and high in essential omega-3 fatty acids. They\u2019re also a great source of protein.\n\nNow, they\u2019re good for your heart and blood sugar because they reduce inflammation and blood sugar \u2013 even when eaten with carbs such as white rice.2-5\n\nThe best fish are wild-caught salmon, sardines, herring, anchovies and mackerel.\n\nRaw nuts taste great and are good for you. They\u2019re high in fiber, very low in carbs and contain healthy, essential fats.6-8\n\nAll of this helps reduce inflammation and lower blood sugar, A1C and Cholesterol levels.\n\nThe best are walnuts, almonds, Hazelnuts, Pistachios and macadamia.\n\nAvoid peanuts and Cashews, since they aren\u2019t nuts. They\u2019re legumes and cause allergies for most people, especially peanuts\n\nEat them raw, because roasting and cooking them changes the fat structure.\n\nAnd make sure you don\u2019t eat too much, since they are very dense in calories.\n\n4 \u2013 Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil is extremely beneficial for heart health and blood sugar.\n\nIt contains oleic acid\u2026 This is a type of monounsaturated fat that has been shown to improve triglycerides and HDL, which are often at unhealthy levels in type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt also increases the fullness hormone, GLP-1.9 This reduces your cravings, especially for sugars.\n\nOlive oil also contains antioxidants called polyphenols, which reduce inflammation, and protect your heart and blood vessels \u2014 two areas people with high blood sugar are weak in.\n\nMake sure you purchase a very reputable source because most olive oil is mixed with other junky oils. Thus, don\u2019t get anything found at your local supermarket. The cheap stuff is filled with junk.\n\nRaw seeds such as flax, sunflower, pumpkin, hemp and sesame seeds have lots of health benefits. They\u2019re very high in fiber and full of amazing minerals and vitamins.\n\nThey\u2019re proven to help:\n\nDecrease your risk for heart disease 10\n\nImprove your blood sugar levels 11\n\nReduce your A1C levels 11\n\nImprove blood flow and circulation 12\n\n6 \u2013 Apple Cider Vinegar\n\nApple cider vinegar has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and lower fasting blood sugar levels. It may also reduce blood sugar response by as much as 20% when consumed with meals containing carbs. 13-15\n\nMost people are told not to have sugar, especially fructose which is the sugar found in fruit. To a certain degree, this is correct.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should ever have fruit juice \u2014 it\u2019s too concentrated.\n\nBut fruit is really made up mostly water and fiber. Plus, they have a low glycemic index and thus, don\u2019t raise your blood sugar very much.\n\nHowever, berries are one of the healthiest not only because they\u2019re low in calories, but also because of the antioxidants their skins contain from ripening in the sun.\n\nBlueberries, raspberries and strawberries are one of the best. I also like sour cherries, even though it\u2019s not a berry.\n\nThese fruits are clinically shown to lower blood sugar, especially after a meal \u2013 even for those with diabetes.16-17\n\n\u2026. So those are the 7 foods clinically proven to lower your blood sugar.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one category even more powerful\u2026\n\nHerbs, Plants & Extracts\n\nEven though today\u2019s topic is about food\u2026 there are specific plants, herbs, spices and extracts that can have dramatically positive effects on your blood sugar \u2014 much more than food.\n\nAnd if you want the truth, plants and herbs are food and probably one the most important categories of food.\n\nAnd specific plants, herbs and extracts can have drug-like results, but without any of the negative side effects.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be surprising because most drugs, well over 50%, are actually based on plants and herbs found in nature.\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies change the original structure, patent them and make billions. Unfortunately, in the process of changing the natural structure, they also create side effects.\n\nAnyway, my favorites are Bitter Melon, Gymnema Sylvestre, Fenugreek, Banaba Leaf and Cinnamon Extract.18-21\n\nWhen these herbs are combined together, along with some specific vitamins and minerals, scientific research has shown over and over again that they can create healthy blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity and lower A1C levels.\n\nSo there you have it. If you want to lower your blood sugar, prevent and reverse diabetes and live a healthier life, eat\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nAnd for faster results, take specific herbal extracts.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26170625\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24850465\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8068603\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26829184\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682084\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21715526\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925120\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25396407\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12600850\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20003621\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17987126\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094144\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26064976\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626409\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20068289\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19013285\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21736853\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2901047\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378874190901075\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26258147\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23102179",

    "title": "#1 Myth About Fruit & Blood Sugar Levels In 2025",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/1-myth-about-the-best-time-to-eat-fruit/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and there\u2019s still a huge myth about FRUIT.\n\nWhich is sad because one of my favorite foods is fruit. For me, it\u2019s like dessert.\n\nSometimes I eat frozen bananas, cherries, mangos, pineapples, and other tropical fruits. I just slowly eat the frozen fruit and you don\u2019t need anything else with it \u2013 no extra sugars or toppings.\n\nThe fruit has lots of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Fruit also contains fiber, which is good for blood sugar levels.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s a LOT of wrong information about fruit and more specifically about the type of sugar found in fruit \u2013 which is called fructose.\n\nYES, \u201cman-made\u201d, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP is bad for you.\n\nThis type of sugar is concentrated and usually found in soda, candy, prepackaged foods, fruit juice, agave nectar, syrups, and other sugary foods.\n\nIt\u2019s bad because it increases blood sugar & insulin levels.\n\nIt\u2019s cheap to produce and it\u2019s addictive.\n\nHFCS is a major contributing factor to 1\n\nInsulin resistance and blood sugar problems\n\nObesity and belly fat\n\nBlood pressure problems\n\nInflammation and fatty liver disease\n\nHowever, this is NOT the type of sugar I\u2019m talking about today.\n\nBasically \u2013 don\u2019t eat High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS).\n\nJust read the label and if it\u2019s in there, don\u2019t eat the food.\n\nEating natural, WHOLE food fruit (not fruit juice) has many health benefits and doesn\u2019t have the negative problems of HFCS.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of things I want to mention.\n\nAbout 100 Calories of Less\n\nFructose is metabolized primarily in your liver and thus, has limited storage capabilities.\n\nUnlike glucose, which is found in grains, for example, can be stored more in your muscle cells, and thus, a lot more can be eaten before it\u2019s converted to fat.\n\nSo try to limit your fruit to about 100-200 calories daily or 25-50 grams. If you exercise, you can eat more.\n\nNOTE: This is especially important for anyone who has blood sugar problems, or simply wants to manage their blood sugar levels better.\n\nOne benefit of fruit is that most fruit does not spike blood sugar levels because it contains fiber. However, fruit JUICE does spike blood sugar and should be avoided.\n\nBest Time To Eat Fruit\n\nThere are a lot of myths about the best time to eat fruit.\n\nSome say first thing in the morning \u2026 some say 30 minutes before a meal because it digests at a different rate than \u201cregular\u201d food \u2026 some say in the afternoon\u2026.\n\nAnd many cultures eat fruit at the end of the meal, like a dessert.\n\nThe truth is, there\u2019s ZERO medical or clinical evidence as to when the best time would be.\n\nSo, don\u2019t worry about this too much.\n\nPersonally, I like fruit on an empty stomach\u2026 like a snack. Or a little after a meal, if I\u2019m craving something sweet.\n\nAnd some people, have some fruit before bed with a little bit of fat like coconut oil and it helps them sleep better and longer.\n\nSo, just experiment. Nothing is written in stone.\n\nTypically, the berries and \u201cthin skin\u201d fruits have higher antioxidants and thus, are better for you.\n\nAnd ideally, you\u2019d eat fruit based on what\u2019s in season.\n\nSo for example, if it\u2019s summertime \u2013 you\u2019d eat more watermelon.\n\nI know these days you can get fruit flown in from around the world and thus, anything can be eaten at any time. However, pay attention to what would typically be in season and eat that.\n\nYour body will actually digest the \u201cseasonal fruit\u201d better.\n\nWhole-food fruits are perfectly fine for you and very healthy.\n\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup is \u201cman-made\u201d and is totally different than the fructose found in fruit and HFCS has to be avoided. Just read the label.\n\nYou can eat fruit any time you want, it\u2019s up to you.\n\nBerries and thin-skin fruits have the most antioxidants. So eat more of them and eat fruits that are in season\n\nTry to limit your fruit consumption to about 100 calories daily. You can eat more if you exercise.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and what I\u2019m about to share with you today pertains to men and women, young and old.\n\nIt\u2019s for anyone who wants to gain muscle mass and even LOSE fat at the same time.\n\nAs an added bonus, you\u2019ll have more energy, live longer, and prevent many health problems.\n\nAnd all of this has to do with lowering your blood sugar and improving insulin sensitivity. Here\u2019s how\u2026\n\nLow Carbs Is BAD News\n\nThese days everyone is talking about going \u201clow carbs\u201d or \u201cketogenic\u201d and \u201chigh fat\u201d diets.\n\nEveryone seems to be afraid of carbohydrates because they think it makes them fat.\n\nBut, this isn\u2019t correct and in the long run \u2013 you\u2019ll dramatically slow your metabolism, kill your thyroid, and get even fatter.\n\nI\u2019ll dig deeper into this topic and these other types of diets in future articles.\n\nInsulin \u2013 Friend or Foe?\n\nWhen you eat carbohydrates, your blood sugar goes up. Then, your pancreas releases insulin to lower your blood sugar back down to normal ranges.\n\nThe amazing part is that insulin is one of the most \u201canabolic\u201d hormones in the body.\n\nAnabolic means to \u201cbuild\u201d, while catabolic means to \u201cbreak down.\u201d\n\nThe thing is that insulin can be anabolic (to build) to either MUSCLE or FAT cells.\n\nDo it correctly and you\u2019ll build muscle and lose fat. Do it incorrectly and you\u2019ll get fat and lose muscle.\n\nAnd today I\u2019m going to tell you how to do it correctly \u2013 so you can build muscle and lose fat, at any age, male or female.\n\nAs an added bonus, you\u2019ll have more energy, live longer, and help avoid many illnesses and diseases.\n\nNow, the secret to making insulin work for you to build muscle, instead of fat, is improving insulin sensitivity.\n\nTo keep it simple, when your receptors are very sensitive to insulin, your body only needs to release a little bit of insulin to lower your blood sugar after a meal.\n\nFewer insulin spikes because of better sensitivity means the food goes directly into the muscle cells, instead of fat cells.\n\nUnfortunately, many factors REDUCE insulin sensitivity:\n\nPrescription drugs and weaker liver\n\nEating the wrong foods and not enough of the right ones\n\nStress (worry, lack of sleep, etc.)\n\nIn fact, poor blood sugar regulation is simply a problem stemming from lowered insulin sensitivity for too many years.\n\nHowever, the good news is that you can fix, reverse, and avoid these problems at any age.\n\nSo here are 5 simple things you can do to improve insulin sensitivity and turn the food you eat into muscle and NOT fat.\n\nProper Macronutrient Timing\n\nProteins, fats, and carbs are \u201cmacronutrients.\u201d By eating them at the correct times, you can quickly increase insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar spikes.\n\nWhenever you eat, make sure you eat your protein, fats, and vegetables FIRST, before you eat your carbohydrates.\n\nBy eating your non-carb foods first, you lower glucose and insulin levels.\n\nStudies have shown that eating protein, vegetables, and fat leads to significantly lower blood sugar levels \u2013 29%, 37%, and 17% at 30, 60, and 120-minute post-meal blood samples.\n\nAs an added bonus, you\u2019ll have more energy and will feel less \u201csleepy.\u201d\n\nEXCEPTION TO THIS RULE: Now, there\u2019s an exception to this rule. The ONE time you should eat carbs first is the meal right after your workout.\n\nIn fact, your \u201cpost-workout meal\u201d should consist of only carbs and protein \u2014 no fats, vegetables, or fiber.\n\nAfter your workout, you WANT an insulin spike to quickly feed your muscles and lower \u201ccatabolic\u201d stress hormones such as Cortisol.\n\nThe cool part is after exercise, your muscle cells are super sensitive to insulin and thus, the food will automatically go right to the muscles, instead of the fat cells.\n\nTaking fiber supplements also helps improve insulin sensitivity.\n\nStudies have shown that taking fiber supplements such as Psyllium husk, 2-3x daily, lowers blood sugar by up to 20% and it lasts the entire day.\n\nThere are also fat and carbohydrate-blocking \u201csuper fibers\u201d such as Chitosan, Kidney Bean extract, Glucomannan, and similar ingredients that also BLOCK the absorption of sugars, fats, and carbs \u2013 so weight loss happens even faster.\n\nYou\u2019ll get remarkable results and also support healthy blood sugar and cholesterol levels at the same time.\n\nAnother way to increase insulin sensitivity is to exercise often, but keep the workouts really short, 45 minutes or less.\n\nIn fact, exercising 20 minutes, 2x daily or 15 min 3x daily works even better.\n\nEvery time you exercise, you improve insulin sensitivity.\n\nOf course, most of us don\u2019t have time to go to the gym or exercise multiple times a day or even have the desire.\n\nHowever, taking a brisk walk for only 10 minutes after each meal, 3x daily, is clinically proven to dramatically improve insulin sensitivity AND lower stress hormones.\n\nAnd that\u2019ll cost you no money and you can do it anywhere, anytime! Just go outside and walk 5 minutes in one direction and then turn around. That\u2019s it!\n\nUse vinegar as much as you can.\n\nVinegar not only reduces the glucose and insulin response from a carb meal, but it also raises insulin sensitivity.\n\nYou can put it on a salad of course or just have 1 tablespoon 3x daily or before each meal.\n\nThe one I use is organic, apple cider vinegar by \u201cBragg.\u201d I get the one that says \u201cWith The Mother.\u201d\n\nTake Herbs, Vitamins & Minerals\n\nFinally, you can take specific herbs, plant extracts, vitamins and minerals that can help support healthy blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity.\n\nThe right combination will give you dramatic improvements within a few days.\n\nIngredients such as rALA, Cinnamon extract, bitter melon extract, vanadyl sulfate, chromium, and a few other ones are very powerful.\n\nThey have drug-like positive effects but without the negative side effects.\n\nImproving insulin sensitivity is the KEY to health, fitness, and longevity. It literally affects every aspect of your health.\n\nAnd if your goal is to have more muscles, lower body fat, have more energy, and avoid getting many health problems, then make sure you:\n\nEat your proteins and fats before your carbs\n\nExercise often in short durations\n\nDrink vinegar, 3x daily\n\nTake specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nAlpana, P., et al, Food Order Has a Significant Impact on Postprandial Glucose and Insulin Levels, Diabetes Care July 2015 vol. 38 no.7 e98-e99.\n\nAnderson, James, et al, Effects of psyllium on glucose and serum lipid responses in men with type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, Am J Clin Nutr October 1999 vol. 70 no. 4 466-473.\n\nJohnston, Carol S., et al, Vinegar Improves Insulin Sensitivity to a High-Carbohydrate Meal in Subjects With Insulin Resistance or Type 2 Diabetes Care, January 2004 vol. 27 no. 1 281-282.\n\nGrace, et al, Hypoglycemic activity of a novel Anthocyanin-rich formulation from Lowbush Blueberry, Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton, Phytomedicine, 2009, May: 16(5): 406-415.\n\nMuldoon, et al, Concurrent physical activity modifies the association between n3 long-chain fatty acids and cardiometabolic risk in midlife adults, J Nutr. 2013 Sep;143(9):1414-20.\n\nSasaki, R, et al, Cyanidin 3-glucoside ameliorates hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity due to downregulation of retinol binding protein 4 expression in diabetic mice, Biochem Pharmacol. 2007 Dec 3;74(11):1619-27.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and most people still don\u2019t know that having high blood sugar is one of the primary causes of aging and health problems.\n\nOf course, it causes problems such as diabetes \u2014 but this also negatively affects your heart, brain, cholesterol, blood pressure, sexual performance, muscle loss, fat gain and more.\n\nIf also causes memory problems. In fact, Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia are now classified as type 3 diabetes.\n\nHigh blood sugar also causes hair loss, wrinkles, muscle loss, fat gain and other \u201cvanity\u201d related problems that make you look and feel older.\n\nNow the real problem is that most people, including doctors,\u2026 are misinformed and confused about the REAL causes of high blood sugar and that\u2019s what today\u2019s short article will reveal to you.\n\nIn fact, you\u2019ll also discover how to avoid and even reverse blood sugar problems.\n\nBefore I begin, I have to point out that genetics always plays a big role in everything. Especially when it comes to type 1 diabetes.\n\nHowever, with that said \u2014 everything else can be avoided or at the very lead, greatly reduce the odds as it relates to high blood sugar and type 2 and 3 diabetes.\n\nNow, the primary reason for blood sugar problems is simply due to hormonal imbalances.\n\nThis includes your sex hormones \u2014 such as testosterone, estrogens and similar.\n\nIn addition to stress hormones like Cortisol, thyroid and adrenal hormones.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget insulin is a very powerful hormone as well, which directly controls your blood sugar levels.\n\nAnd yes, all of these hormones get worse as we age and yes, all of these hormones CAN easily be improved at ANY age.\n\nSo, please don\u2019t worry if you have \u201cbad\u201d genetics or a \u201cfamily history\u201d of diabetes like I do \u2026 Or you\u2019re \u201colder\u201d and think you can\u2019t make any improvements and it\u2019s all \u201cdownhill\u201d.\n\nIn over 25 years, I\u2019ve NEVER had a single person, patient or client that I didn\u2019t improve their blood sugar levels. This even includes those with genetic Type 1 diabetes.\n\nWhen you know how the body works and the \u201csecrets\u201d to fixing health problems \u2013 anything and everything is possible.\n\nTwo Clinically Proven Ways\n\nSo there are 2 specific things you need to do to improve your blood sugar levels, so you can avoid and even reverse type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe FIRST is you want to lower your blood sugar to healthy levels.\n\nYou obviously do NOT want \u201chigh\u201d blood sugar because that\u2019s the major problem.\n\nHowever, you also do NOT want \u201clow\u201d blood sugar because that causes negative hormonal changes by increasing stress hormones such as cortisol, which is KNOWN to cause diabetes and insulin resistance.\n\nThis brings me to your SECOND goal and that\u2019s to improve INSULIN SENSITIVITY.\n\nMost people never talk about insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity, but this is the underlying cause of blood sugar problems.\n\nSimply stated, when you eat foods that increase your blood sugar, your pancreas secretes insulin to lower it back down to normal, healthy levels.\n\nBUT, if your receptors have REDUCED sensitivity to the insulin and thus, they\u2019ve become \u201cresistant\u201d,\u2026 Your body will now have to produce a LOT MORE insulin to lower your blood sugar and THIS ends up causing all the problems.\n\nSo what you want to do are 3 simple things:\n\nStep 1 \u2013 LOWER BLOOD SUGAR to healthy ranges.\n\nThis is done primarily through your diet:\n\nLower your simple sugars and eat more complex carbs. Do NOT \u201cdrink\u201d your calories (soda, juices, alcohol, etc.)\n\nHave protein, healthy fats and fiber with all of your meals.\n\nEat smaller meals, but more often.\n\nThese 3 simple \u201ceating\u201d tactics keep your blood sugar stable \u2013 not high or low.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 IMPROVE INSULIN SENSITIVITY to reduce insulin secretion.\n\nThis is done primarily through exercise:\n\nBuild more muscle by lifting weights \u2013 cables, dumbbells, machines, your own body weight, etc.\n\nDo cardiovascular exercise \u2014 fast walking and rebounding are my favorites. But anything you feel that\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d for you.\n\nThe more you exercise and more muscle you have, the more your body can burn and utilize the sugar.\n\nThe end result is better insulin sensitivity.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 TAKE SPECIFIC NUTRIENTS that help promote healthy blood sugar & insulin sensitivity.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, most of us do NOT eat perfectly, all the time.\n\nAnd even if we did, the foods we have these days are lacking in many of the essential nutrients that our body requires to function at optimal levels.\n\nThe good news is that there are specific herbs, vitamins and minerals that are scientifically researched to help promote healthy blood sugar and increase insulin sensitivity at the same time.\n\nYou\u2019ll get the biggest and fastest improvements, with the least amount of effort when taking these specific nutrients with an improved diet and exercise plan.\n\nIn fact, you can copy the same formula my family and I have used since 2001.\n\nWhatever you do, please take action right now and improve your blood sugar and insulin sensitivity.\n\nYou\u2019ll look younger, feel better and age more slowly.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/main-cause-of-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/",
    "content": "Today I want to talk about non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) because I\u2019ve noticed that this is turning into a big problem in 2025. So much so that it affects an estimated 25% of the population.1\n\nThere\u2019s also alcoholic liver disease (ALD) which is caused by consuming too much alcohol.\n\nBut people with NAFLD do not consume any or very little alcohol. But they do consume a large amount of another type of food and I\u2019ll tell you about that in a minute.\n\nBoth NAFLD and ALD will cause scarring of your liver and can lead to cirrhosis, which can lead to liver problems or failure.\n\nJust remember that your liver is extremely important to your health \u2013 both how you look and feel, your immune system, your mind, and hundreds of other important daily functions.\n\nSo just because you\u2019re not drinking alcohol or taking liver toxic pills does NOT mean that you have a healthy liver \u2013 which is why I\u2019m making this article today.\n\nSo, why is this or should this be important to you?\n\nNo Symptoms Of Fatty Liver\n\nIn many cases of NAFLD, there are no noticeable symptoms. Swelling in your belly or pain in the upper right side of your abdomen would cause concern. So would fatigue. And of course, an enlarged liver, which would need a doctor\u2019s exam.\n\nThus, by the time you think or feel you have NAFLD, there\u2019s been too much damage to the liver. Remember, we want to be proactive.\n\nReversing liver damage is possible, but it\u2019s a lot more work.\n\nNow, I have noticed that some people have belly fat, especially the harmful, visceral belly fat \u2013 the kind that\u2019s inside your organs and causes your stomach to pop out, like a \u201cbeer belly\u201d or a pregnant look? These people tend to have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\nNo clinical proof for this, but just something I\u2019ve observed dozens of times over the years.\n\nSo the point here is that it is hard to tell. Doing liver tests doesn\u2019t always tell you that you have NAFLD. The specific elevated liver enzymes such as ALT and AST could be caused because of stress, exercise, muscle tissue breakdown, taking medications, and so forth.\n\nNot necessarily related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\nRisk Factors and Causes\n\nStudies have linked insulin resistance to be the strongest risk factor in having NAFLD.\n\nPeople who are most likely to develop insulin resistance include people who are overweight and/or lead a sedentary lifestyle (don\u2019t move or exercise much).\n\nOther risk factors for NAFLD include:\n\nhigh cholesterol levels (and taking statin drugs)\n\nhigh triglyceride levels\n\nuse of corticosteroids\n\nmany oral prescription drugs\n\nsudden weight loss may also raise your risk of NAFLD due to fast fat loss\n\npoor eating habits of course\n\nAs you can see, a lot of people have these problems and thus, why NAFLD is so prevalent these days.\n\nYour primary goal is that you must improve your insulin sensitivity and thus, have lower blood sugar levels.\n\nThis means that you need to improve your lifestyle, eat better, and move more.\n\nIf you are overweight, you need to slowly lose weight. Again, eat better and exercise.\n\nThe more muscle you have and the lower your body fat, the better your insulin sensitivity.\n\nI know this is basic stuff for most of us \u2013 eat better and exercise more, but sadly \u2013 most people just don\u2019t do it.\n\nHowever, the main goal here is to improve your blood sugar levels.\n\nThis means removing all sugars, including fruit. Do NOT drink any of your calories \u2013 no alcohol, no soda, no fruit juice, and so forth. Only water, tea, and small amounts of black coffee.\n\nAnd there are two very important supplements I suggest you start taking.\n\nCholine and Inositol For Liver Health\n\nThe first is Choline and Inositol. These are B-Vitamins.\n\nTake these specifically for fatty liver reasons. Both help dissolve fat in the liver, especially Choline. But both work well together.\n\nTake 500 mg of both, 3x daily with food. Thus, a higher dosage than recommended on the bottle.\n\nThey usually come packaged together in one pill. I don\u2019t care what brand you take. There\u2019s nothing special about Choline and Inositol, so get whatever is inexpensive.\n\nBlood Sugar Optimizer\n\nThe next thing I highly suggest is you take Blood Sugar Optimizer. This is a product that I take myself for over a decade now. It is great at BOTH improving insulin sensitivity AND healthy blood sugar levels, while also helping improve A1C levels.\n\nBlood Sugar Optimizer contains numerous clinically proven ingredients at the correct, clinically proven dosages.\n\nNot only can it help with NAFLD or ALD, but it\u2019s also great for people who want to avoid diabetes, lose fat, and live healthier lives by having healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nThere are lots of products that claim to help with blood sugar levels, but I can honestly say that Blood Sugar Optimizer is the most complete.\n\nI have a special link to the page for more details, about how the ingredients work, the clinical studies, and also free bottle offers.\n\nSo there you have it. Improve your liver and you\u2019ll improve your health in so many ways. This is especially important if you are overweight, have blood sugar or cholesterol problems drink alcohol, and take prescription medications \u2014 all of which negatively affect your liver and blood sugar levels.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.sutterhealth.org/cpmc/services/liver/fatty-liver-disease",

    "content": "2025 \u2013 As some people know, higher blood sugar levels, leading to higher insulin levels, can lead to many health problems.\n\nUnfortunately, this situation seems to be getting worse each year\u2026\n\nAnd as of 2025, it\u2019s estimated that over 60% of all US adults have diabetes (15%-18%) or prediabetes (43-45%) \u20131\n\nHowever, what\u2019s even worse is that high blood sugar can also cause and exacerbate additional health problems such as:\n\nInflammation & joint pain\n\nPoor cognition & memory problems\n\nBasically, high blood sugar accelerates the aging process.\n\nSo with that said, I\u2019m going to quickly discuss 10 easy ways that can help to have healthy blood sugar levels quickly, easily, and naturally, and reduce future health problems.\n\nAlso at the end of this article, I\u2019ll give you my personal favorite \u201cformula\u201d for supporting healthy blood sugar\u2026 something my family and I have been using for over a decade.\n\nRegular, daily exercise can help you lose unwanted fat. But more importantly, helps improve \u201cinsulin sensitivity\u201d.\n\nHealthy, normal insulin sensitivity means your cells are better able to use the available sugar in your bloodstream, and thus, less insulin is needed.\n\nHence, the foods you eat get used more for energy and muscle growth, rather than fat storage.\n\nAny form of exercise is excellent. Daily is ideal.\n\nYou only need 20-30 minutes.\n\nFast walking is fantastic. I also suggest anything that helps you build more muscle \u2014 such as lifting weights with cables, machines, dumbells, etc.\n\n2. Eat The Correct Carbohydrates\n\nWhen you eat carbs, your body converts them into sugar (mostly glucose). As your blood sugar goes up, your body secretes insulin to help lower it back down to a normal, healthy range.\n\nNow, carbs are not evil. However, the wrong carbs, especially in high amounts ARE bad for your health.\n\nSo your goal is to eliminate or minimize man-made carbs such as bread, pasta, snacks, sugars, drinks, etc. These have a high \u201cglycemic index/load\u201d, which shoots up your blood sugar.\n\nFocus more on vegetables, some yams, a little bit of rice, legumes, quinoa, and whole grains. Get rid of the bad carbs and eat less total carbs.(2,3,4,5)\n\nFiber has so many benefits and sadly, most people are barely getting any. You should be eating at least 25 grams or more. While most Americans are barely getting around 5-10.\n\nThe cool part is that fiber slows carb digestion and sugar absorption, leading to a gradual rise in blood sugar levels, without the high spikes.\n\nIt\u2019s best to get both soluble and insoluble fiber in your diet because both help improve your blood sugar levels. (6,7,8)\n\nFoods high in fiber are also the ones I recommend for your ideal source of carbs: vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get enough fiber from your foods, then make sure you add some fiber supplements to your diet. They really do help.\n\n4. Eat Smaller Meals, More Often\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about this when it comes to weight loss. However, one of the reasons for the weight loss is the lower blood sugar levels from eating smaller meals. (9,10,11)\n\nMost people eat like 2 meals a day and these are high-calorie meals, which spike up your blood sugar.\n\nJust have 5-6 small meals or snacks throughout the day. You\u2019ll have better blood sugar, more energy, and feel fuller.\n\n5. Watch What You Drink\n\nYou should never drink your calories \u2014 any sodas, juices, alcohol, \u201cshakes\u201d or anything similar. They all digest quickly and spike up your blood sugar.\n\nThe best drink is water, or maybe even green tea. First, most people are dehydrated, so they have to drink more water.\n\nWater also flushes your kidneys, cleanses your liver and thus, eliminates excess blood sugar through urine\u2026 all of this helps reduce diabetes.(12,13,14)\n\n6. Manage Your Stress Levels\n\nYou can\u2019t have good health without also discussing stress management.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that stress increases blood sugar levels AND decreases insulin sensitivity. (15,16)\n\nThis is because of a change in hormones such as glucagon, cortisol, testosterone, adrenal hormones, and so forth. (17,18)\n\nNow, we can\u2019t eliminate stress, but you can MANAGE it by not overreacting to negative situations.\n\nKnowing that \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d and spending a little time every day to \u201crelax\u201d \u2014 such as exercise, meditation, taking a walk, reading a book, taking a nap, and so forth.\n\nEven 15 minutes makes a big improvement. (19)\n\n7. Better Quality Sleep\n\nYou can\u2019t manage your stress if you don\u2019t get enough, quality sleep.\n\nAgain, this has to do with negative changes in your hormones when you don\u2019t sleep well. (20,21)\n\nI\u2019ve never been a good sleeper, so here are some simple tips:\n\nGo to bed around 9-10 pm, for sure before midnight. An hour before bed, start to relax \u2014 turn off electronics, dim the lights, read a book, journal, etc. Make sure your room is pitch dark. Go to sleep focusing on positive thoughts, rather than negative ones.\n\nGo to bed around 9-10 pm, for sure before midnight.\n\nAn hour before bed, start to relax \u2014 turn off electronics, dim the lights, read a book, journal, etc.\n\nMake sure your room is pitch dark.\n\nGo to sleep focusing on positive thoughts, rather than negative ones.\n\n8. Drink Apple Cider Vinegar\n\nApple cider vinegar, like exercise, helps lower blood sugar levels AND improve insulin sensitivity. (22,23,24)\n\nAnd you don\u2019t need much. Just mix 1 teaspoon into a glass of water, 3x daily.\n\nLosing unwanted fat and decreasing your belly fat has numerous health benefits.\n\nThis is even more true with blood sugar levels because the lower your body fat, the higher your insulin sensitivity.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that you can actually eat MORE carbs, as you decrease your body fat. (25)\n\nThe good news is that all of the solutions I\u2019ve mentioned today, help in having healthy blood sugar AND reducing body fat levels.\n\n10. Take Natural Supplements\n\nSo far, everything I\u2019ve mentioned today is very important but does require time and effort. Exercising, eating the right foods at the right times in the right amounts, and stress management don\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nIt\u2019s small changes, creating daily habits that will allow you to reach your goals.\n\nUnfortunately, most people just give up after a week or two since they aren\u2019t getting results fast enough, especially for the amount of time and effort.\n\nThis is why I always suggest people take natural supplements. It helps speed up your results, it\u2019s easy and convenient.\n\nMinerals such as Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium, and Chromium are very important and most people are deficient in them.\n\nAlso, scientifically shown ingredients and herbs such as Cinnamon extract, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Bitter Melon extract, Fenugreek seed, and Vanadyl Sulfate will help support healthy blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.\n\nRemember, improving blood sugar helps you avoid diabetes, and most health ailments AND reduces the aging process.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely one of the most important things you should focus on for health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

Every cell in your body needs glucose to create energy.\n\nThe problem is when you have TOO much glucose and thus, your blood sugar levels are elevated most of the day and your body OVER secretes insulin.\n\nWhat most people don\u2019t know is that elevated blood sugar and insulin levels are a large contributor causing heart disease, weight gain, accelerated aging, and of course \u2013 a major cause of type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut I Like Sugar \u2013 I Like My \u201cSweets\u201d\n\nNow, the problem with regular table sugar is that it raises your blood sugar levels sky-high.\n\nAnd artificial sweeteners such as Sucralose or Aspartame, are just loaded with negative side effects.\n\nSo, today I want to talk about Stevia\u2026\n\nDoes it raise your blood sugar?\u2026\n\nIf daily use can eventually cause diabetes, like some of the other artificial sweeteners?\u2026\n\nStevia is a natural product made from a plant that grows in South America. It\u2019s basically an \u201cherb\u201d, so it\u2019s not artificial like other sweeteners such as Aspartame (Equal\u00ae), Saccharin (Sweet N Low\u00ae) or Sucralose (Splenda\u00ae).\n\nThe active compounds of Stevia are up to 150 times the sweetness of sugar1 and are heat-stable (good for cooking), pH-stable, and nonfermentable.\n\nStevia has been used for centuries and it\u2019s extremely popular in Japan.\n\nOne of the features that make it so famous is that it has virtually no calories and\u2026 being sweeter than candy can be a plus for many people.\n\nThere are over 90 studies about Stevia\u2019s safety, so the FDA already approved it as a natural sweetener.\n\nDoes Stevia Raise Blood Sugar Levels?\n\nStevia doesn\u2019t just keep your glucose level steady, it can help lower it.\n\nThere is quite a bit of research on this, and studies have shown that eating foods prepared with Stevia can lower blood sugar, and even better, increase insulin sensitivity.\n\nThis means that with continued use (along with the right diet and supplements), it can actually help decrease your risk for diabetes and may help reverse it!3\n\nSummary & Important Facts\n\nIt doesn\u2019t raise blood sugar, it lowers it. Its glycemic index is zero, which means that it will not be converted into glucose.\n\nStevia has no calories.\n\nIt can help lower insulin levels and protect against insulin insensitivity.\n\nStevia can help you lose weight because when you use it as a sweetener, your body will be deprived of sugars, therefore it will mobilize fat and burn it for energy.\n\nIt decreases cravings for sweets, so you won\u2019t fall into temptation in the supermarket.\n\nStevia is rich in minerals, vitamins, and phytonutrients.1\n\nIt protects you from candida overgrowth, because it is a sweet without glucose in it, so the fungus will just starve to death.\n\nStevia is a great way to protect yourself from the risks of high blood sugar by using it as a safe alternative to regular sugar and artificial sweeteners\u2026\n\nBut it isn\u2019t a get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nIn order to live a healthy life for a long time, you still have to pay attention to your diet, exercise regularly, and consider taking proper supplements (specific herbs, vitamins and minerals) to speed up the results.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14681850\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900484/\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1204764\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1490021",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and more than ever, the newest research has clearly shown that chronically high blood sugar levels are linked to accelerated aging and numerous health problems for your body and brain!\n\nNot to mention, high blood sugar can cause:\n\nunhealthy levels of blood pressure & cholesterol\n\nand poor memory (more below)\n\nHowever, the newest scientific research shows that chronically high blood sugar is also linked to Alzheimer\u2019s & poor memory.\n\nIn fact, Alzheimer\u2019s is now considered a form of type 3 diabetes!\n\nType 1, 2 and 3 Diabetes\n\nAs a reminder, Type 1 Diabetes is purely genetics. It typically happens in children and young adults. They need to inject insulin for the rest of their lives.\n\nType 2 Diabetes is more of an environmental cause, coupled with genetics.\n\nToo many years of high blood sugar and insulin levels, wear out the insulin receptors and pancreas. So eventually you may become type 2 diabetic.\n\nThen you\u2019ll need to watch your diet, exercise and take medication in the form of pills and/or injections maybe for the rest of your life!\n\nAnd now there\u2019s type 3 Diabetes, which is linked to Alzheimer\u2019s and cognitive/brain aging.\n\nSimilar to type 2, your body is LESS sensitive to insulin.\n\nHowever, instead of affecting the muscle cells, type 3 focuses more on your brain cells.\n\nYour Brain Cells Require a Lot of Energy to Function\n\nYour brain is an energy hog. Although it\u2019s just 2 percent of your body\u2019s weight, it demands 20% of the oxygen and calories you take in.\n\nWhen your brain\u2019s cells resist insulin, they don\u2019t take in the glucose they need to burn for fuel.\n\nAs a result, they\u2019re \u201chungry.\u201d Therefore, they slowly starve to death\u2026. And their ability to function goes with them.\n\n\u201cSenior\u201d moments of forgetfulness\n\nDifficulty in learning new things\n\nProblems in concentrating\n\n\u2026 and of course, memory problems.\n\nOver time, for reasons nobody understands yet, beta-amyloid plaques replace the brain\u2019s cells.\n\nWith beta-amyloid plaques substituting for functioning brain cells, people get all the sad and unpleasant symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe permanent loss of precious memories.\n\nThe changes in personality.\n\nThe irrational behavior.\n\nAnd all of this starts to explain why Type 2 diabetics are twice as likely as non-diabetics to get Alzheimer\u2019s!\n\nIn fact, you can have both kinds of diabetes \u2014 millions of Americans do, including my grandmother.\n\nFor decades, because science hadn\u2019t found the cause of it, the mainstream media has portrayed Alzheimer\u2019s as a \u201cmysterious, incurable disease\u201d you either got or you didn\u2019t.\n\nOr maybe it came from \u201cbad genes\u201d and thus, you couldn\u2019t treat it. Once you got it, you went downhill until the end.\n\nHowever, the good news is that because it\u2019s a variation of diabetes, you can potentially reduce your risk of getting it\u2026. Just as you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn fact, millions of people have improved and even reversed their type 2 diabetes with an improved lifestyle and thus, similar positive effects may be had with type 3 diabetes.\n\nThe Solution \u2013 3 Simple Changes\n\nWhether your goal is to reduce your risk of Alzheimer\u2019s or any form of diabetes\u2026. Or you want to simply slow the aging process \u2013 both physically and mentally \u2026\n\nYou\u2019ll need to control your blood sugar and insulin levels.\n\nThere isn\u2019t enough room for me to explain the process here\u2026.\n\nHowever, here are 3 simple changes you can make today, that\u2019ll cause improvements and help promote healthy blood sugar levels within a normal range:\n\nImprove your diet by eating fewer sugars, processed carbohydrates and grains.\n\nHave more vegetables, healthy fats and proteins.\n\nReduce liquids that have calories (juices, soda, etc.). Stick to water, tea and coffee.\n\nThe more muscle you have and the lower your body fat, the better your insulin sensitivity is.\n\nLifting weights (cables, dumbbells, machines, bodyweight exercises, etc.) 3x weekly, coupled with daily walks or at least 3x weekly \u2014 will make a huge improvement in promoting healthy blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are a few clinically researched herbs, vitamins and minerals that scientific research has shown to help support healthy blood sugar levels within a normal range and insulin sensitivity.\n\nCombined with a healthy lifestyle, you can see better and faster results.\n\nCOMBINATION = Faster & Easier Results\n\nDiet, exercise, stress management and select supplements healthy blood sugar \u2013 when utilized together, in my opinion, are by far the best and most effective solutions for\n\nhealthy blood sugar levels within a normal range\n\nreducing your risks for health problems associated with high blood sugar & insulin levels\n\nhelping you live a healthy and hopefully longer life \u2013 physically, emotionally & mentally.\n\nHowever, none of this matters if you don\u2019t take action.

    "content": "So, if your goal in 2025 is to gain as much muscle as possible, you are going to need carbohydrates and more of it.\n\nHowever, if your goal is to lose fat and get lean, you are still going to need carbs to help you RETAIN the muscle while you\u2019re losing fat and getting ripped.\n\nEither way, you do need carbs \u2013 no matter what anyone tells you.\n\nRemember, your muscles and brain run on sugar or more specifically, glucose.\n\nI\u2019ll keep this simple, all carbohydrates will convert to glucose, which is basically sugar. So, keep this in mind.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard, for the average genetic person, who is not taking steroids or similar drugs, to gain muscle on keto or carnivore-type diets and thus, no carbohydrate diets. Certainly not long term.\n\nI\u2019ve had competitive bodybuilder clients of mine, with great genetics and lots of drugs, not grow much muscle being on low-carb diets. The minute I manipulated their carbs and increased them, they gained between 10 or as much as 30 lbs of stage weight \u2013 which is basically all muscle.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to learn today.\n\nBecause the truth is that carbohydrates are not evil.\n\nRemember, your muscles and brain run on carbohydrates.\n\nEven breast milk for a growing baby is primarily made of carbs, not protein.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear some experts saying that your body or brain prefers ketones, but that\u2019s false.\n\nKetones are for survival, not for growth.\n\nThere may not be any essential carbohydrates like there are essential amino acids and fatty acids, but carbs are utilized best by the body. Especially if you work out, lift weights, and want to grow muscles!\n\nHowever, too many of the wrong kinds of carbs, eaten in excess are bad for you. But, this can be said about ALL macronutrients \u2013 including proteins and fats.\n\nAlso, and most importantly, you need to improve insulin sensitivity. The better the insulin sensitivity, the more muscle and less fat you\u2019ll be.\n\nLifting weights and having more muscle will improve insulin sensitivity.\n\nTaking specific supplements such as berberine, cinnamon extract, ALA, bitter melon, vanadyl sulfate a few others will dramatically promote healthy blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.\n\nI think the best all-in-one formula is Blood Sugar Optimizer, which is what I\u2019ve been using for over 20 years.\n\nOkay, so now that you know the facts, let\u2019s talk about using carbs or sugars to gain muscle and lose fat.\n\nGaining Muscle With Carbs\n\nI\u2019ll keep this super basic and simple, gaining muscle is a two-step process.\n\nThere\u2019s an ANABOLIC process which basically means an increase in protein synthesis.\n\nThen there\u2019s an ANTI-CATABLIC process which is the decrease in protein oxidation.\n\nFor example, testosterone is anabolic to muscle growth. It grows muscles.\n\nHowever, the stress hormone cortisol does the opposite, it\u2019s catabolic to muscle growth. Meaning, it breaks down muscle tissue.\n\nSo, we want to increase anabolism and protein synthesis, which is to increase testosterone.\n\nBut at the same time, we want to minimize catabolism from cortisol and thus, lower excess cortisol.\n\nAnd one of the most potent, natural, anti-catabolic, cortisol-reducing nutrients is carbohydrates and sugar.\n\nIn fact, the rise in insulin from carbs and sugars is BOTH anabolic and anti-catabolic.\n\nThis is why bodybuilders and even long-distance runners or cyclists use injectable insulin.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s another topic for another video\u2026\n\nSo, when it comes to gaining muscle, the most important times for eating the most carbs is:\n\nAfter your workout, you want to fill up your glycogen levels since they just got depleted from the workout.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re super insulin-sensitive after the workout, so the carbs and sugars get absorbed the best and have a much lower chance of converting to body fat.\n\nLastly, you want to lower the carbolic cortisol hormone after the workout to reduce muscle catabolism induced by hard training.\n\nSo\u2026 After the workout, you want to have faster digesting carbs that will increase your insulin and blood sugar levels more. This would be foods such as white rice, cereals, and fruits such as bananas and pineapples.\n\nAnother important time is the last meal of the day, before bed. More carbs lowers cortisol, which is what we want before bed. High cortisol levels mean more adrenal, so it\u2019s harder to sleep.\n\nHigher cortisol also doesn\u2019t allow your sleep hormone, melatonin to be released.\n\nHowever, before bed, we want slower-burning, lower glycemic carbs \u2013 such as yams, legumes, and berries. This way, there aren\u2019t sugar and insulin spikes in the middle of sleep, which might wake you up.\n\nAnother important time for higher carbs is breakfast. After 8+ hours of sleep, we need to fill up the muscle glycogen stores again, so time to have carbs. I prefer slower-burning carbs in the morning \u2013 for example, Ezekiel bread or yams.\n\nThis also keeps my energy levels more stable. Having junky cereals, bread, muffins, juice, and other breakfast foods just makes you tired and you\u2019ll crash a couple of hours later.\n\nI\u2019m working, so I don\u2019t want this.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t forget about the pre-workout meal. Some people like to have lots of sugars before the workout, fast-acting carbs. I\u2019m not too fond of this because it\u2019ll shoot up my insulin levels and I get tired and lethargic. That\u2019s the last thing I want before a workout.\n\nAlso, remember how I said carbs lower cortisol?\u2026 that\u2019s good after the workout or before bed. But, not BEFORE the workout. We want higher cortisol and adrenaline levels before the workout. You\u2019ll be stronger and more motivated.\n\nSo, I like to have a protein shake before my workout. Something small. I have whey isolate mixed with a slower-burning carb, such as highly branched cyclic Dextrin.\n\nThis carb source quickly passes through the stomach. It\u2019s easier to tolerate and typically won\u2019t cause gastrointestinal discomfort like most carb drinks do.\n\nAnd because it has a low glycemic index, it won\u2019t spike up your blood sugar levels, unlike pure glucose/dextrose/maltodextrin. This means steady energy for the workout.\n\nNOTE: I take 1-2 pills of Blood Sugar Optimizer with all of my bigger carb meals. Again, it helps promote healthy blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity \u2013 which means better utilization of carbs, which means more muscle and less body fat.\n\nLosing Fat With Carbs\n\nSo, what if your goal is fat loss? Do you want to get leaner and get ripped abs?\n\nHonestly, I suggest doing almost everything that I just suggested for gaining muscle, but just lower your total carbohydrate calories.\n\nWhen it comes to dieting, the most important time for extra carbs is after your workout. We want to fill up your glycogen stores in the muscle. We want to lower catabolic hormones like cortisol.\n\nPlus, your insulin sensitivity is super high, so the carbs will get utilized the best.\n\nFor the rest of the meals, just go lower total carbs and select more slow-burning, lower glycemic carbs.\n\nI would also reduce or eliminate fruits\u2026. Other than maybe a little bit of berries.\n\nAgain, I would take Blood Sugar Optimizer with all my carb meals.\n\nWhat About Protein & Fats?\n\nToday\u2019s topic was about sugar and carbs. However, what about proteins and fats?\n\nI suggest you eat 1 gram of protein, per pound of body weight. So, if you weigh 200 lbs, eat 200 grams of animal protein. This includes dairy, such as whey isolate.\n\nWhen dieting, and if you have very low carbs, you may increase the protein intake to 1.5 grams. So, if you weigh 200 lbs, instead of 200 grams, you\u2019d eat 300 grams.\n\nAs for fats, I like to keep mine to a minimum. I have 6-8 grams of fish oil daily. And 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. That\u2019s it \u2013 whether I\u2019m trying to gain muscle or lose fat.\n\nThe rest of my fats will be from the lean proteins.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re gaining muscle or losing fat, you\u2019re mainly manipulating your carbs. More carbs when trying to gain muscle. Less when trying to get lean.\n\nCarbs can either be good or bad for you, depending on the type and amount of carbs, as well as the time you consume them.\n\nMore carbs when trying to gain muscle and less when getting leaner.\n\nThe most important time for extra carbs is post-workout. Some people have almost 40-50% of their daily carb calories after the gym.\n\nMake sure you take Blood Sugar Optimizer with all your carb meals and most importantly, get quality sleep.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to eat more carbs, gain more muscle, lose more fat, and be healthier in the process!\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s topic isn\u2019t just for anyone who is diabetic\u2026\n\nit\u2019s for anyone who is pre-diabetic\n\nif you want or need to support healthy blood sugar or A1C levels\n\nif you\u2019re concerned about memory & cognition\n\nif you want to lose fat, especially the stubborn belly fat\n\nif you want to improve your blood pressure and/or cholesterol levels\n\nActually, I can go on and on. But the point is that any foods that increase your blood sugar to high levels, that put stress on your pancreas, and decrease insulin sensitivity will eventually cause the above-mentioned illnesses and thus, MUST be avoided.\n\nIn fact, the secret to longevity is greatly determined by managing your blood sugar levels.\n\nAnd there are lots of ways to do this naturally \u2013 specific forms of exercise, stress management, clinically proven herbs, vitamins, and of course, your diet \u2013 which is what I\u2019m going to quickly discuss today.\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not always about carbohydrates\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s get started with 5 foods that you should avoid if you have blood sugar regulation problems or simply, want to look and feel younger:\n\n1 \u2013 Sugar-Sweetened Beverages\n\nI think by far, the worst foods are sugar-sweetened beverages. This includes sodas of course, but lots of other drinks have added sugars as well \u2014 lemonade, sweetened iced tea, coffees, and even some fruit juices.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019d say that even regular fruit juice should be avoided as well.\n\nOne main problem is you can drink hundreds of calories in minutes \u2013 which you could NEVER do if you were to eat real food. Even if it were a big plate of pasta or rice.\n\nNot only do all of these drinks contain pure sugar and thus, almost instantly spike up your blood sugar and insulin levels. But they typically contain the worst type of, man-made sugar called \u2014 high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).\n\nThis is super concentrated fructose, which is the sugar found in fruits.\n\nSimply stated, it\u2019s a negative nutrient partitioning agent and thus, 100 calories of HFCS, will convert to fat, much faster than other foods \u2014 even regular sugar or white bread.\n\nSo, just avoid it and make sure you read the label because HFCS is found in so many products.\n\nIn addition to high fructose corn syrup, you need to also avoid other types of \u201csyrups\u201d, such as maple syrup, honey, and agave nectar and similar sugar-packed foods.\n\nThey may be \u201cnatural\u201d and not man-made like HFCS, but they produce similar negative effects.\n\n3 \u2013 Artificial Sweeteners\n\nSo at this point, you may be thinking \u201cfine, no sugars, I\u2019ll just use some artificial, no-calorie sweeteners\u201d\u2026 BAD MOVE.\n\nThese are also linked to diabetes1,2,4 and a host of other health problems such as inflammation decreased immunity and infertility.3\n\nSo far, the research has shown that the best, safest, and no-calorie sweetener is Stevia \u2013 which is actually an herb, not man-made. In fact, it can help LOWER blood sugar, in addition to blood pressure and cholesterol levels.5-7\n\nI also like Xylitol, but in higher dosages can cause stomach problems.\n\nEating cereal is one of the worst ways to start your day, especially if you\u2019re concerned about your blood sugar.\n\nDespite the health claims on their boxes, most cereals are highly processed and contain far more carbs than many people realize. Plus, it contains bad carbs \u2014 such as corn, wheat, and sugar.\n\nIn addition, they provide very little protein, a nutrient that can help you feel full and satisfied while keeping your blood sugar levels stable during the day.8\n\nAnything that comes in a box, that\u2019s man-made and produced by multi-billion dollar companies should be avoided!\n\nEven though carbs, specifically higher amounts of those that have a high glycemic index and glycemic load, cause an increase in the blood sugar \u2013 the other problem is insulin sensitivity.\n\nWhen your cells aren\u2019t as sensitive to insulin, your body has to produce more and more, to get the same \u201cblood sugar lowering\u201d effect. Eventually, your burn out your pancreas and you then become diabetic.\n\nI\u2019m simplified this a bit, but I hope you get the point \u2014 your goal is to lower blood sugar levels AND improve insulin sensitivity.\n\nWell, but avoiding the foods I\u2019ve mentioned today, you will for sure help lower blood sugar levels.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one type of food that does NOT increase your blood sugar, but it does cause a major decrease in insulin sensitivity and that\u2019s \u201cbad fats\u201d.\n\nThese include \u201ctrans fats\u201d, which are found in margarine, peanut butter, spreads, creamers, frozen foods, crackers, snacks, muffins, and baked goods.\n\nAlthough trans fats (also known as partially hydrogenated) don\u2019t directly raise blood sugar levels, they\u2019ve been linked to increased inflammation, insulin resistance, and belly fat, as well as lower \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol levels and impaired arterial function.9-12\n\nAdditionally, you need to limit your omega 6 fats, which is found in high amounts in vegetable and seed oils such as:\n\nThese oils are completely unnatural and cause massive insulin insensitivity and a host of other \u201cinflammatory\u201d diseases.13-16\n\nKnowing which foods to avoid when you\u2019re concerned about your blood sugar can sometimes seem tough. You may feel like you can\u2019t eat anything.\n\nI know this very well because I have blood sugar regulation problems in my own family. In fact, you can get more information about how my uncle supported healthy blood sugar naturally, & lost 34 lbs.\n\nHowever, let me simplify things:\n\nYour main goals should include staying away from unhealthy fats, liquid sugars, processed grains, and other foods that contain refined carbs.\n\nAvoiding foods that increase your blood sugar levels and cause insulin resistance can help keep you healthy now and reduce your risk of future complications.\n\nEat as naturally as possible. Avoid man-made products that come in a box and are filled with lots of ingredients. Keep it simple!\n\nIn a future article, I\u2019ll go over some of the best foods to eat if you\u2019re concerned about your blood sugar levels.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://plan.core-apps.com/eb2018/abstract/382e0c7eb95d6e76976fbc663612d58a\n\nhttp://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/36/9/2530.full\n\nhttps://www.thediabetescouncil.com/the-relationship-between-diabetes-and-sweeteners/\n\nhttps://health.clevelandclinic.org/5-best-and-worst-sweeteners-your-dietitians-picks/\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049503003871\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jat.1604/abstract\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010904\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25733459\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24251700\n\nhttp://jn.nutrition.org/content/135/3/562.short\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15051604\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19584878\n\nBiochem Pharmacol 2009 Mar 15;77(6):937-46\n\nThe Atlantic June 22, 2012\n\nAm J Clin Nutr June 2006 vol. 83 no. 6 S1483-1493S\n\nAm J Clin Nutr June 2006 vol. 83 no. 6 S1505-1519S",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/is-berberine-a-natural-alternative-to-ozempic-semaglutide/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about an herb called Berberine and if it really is a natural and safe alternative for lowering blood sugar, compared to a drug called Ozempic, also known as semaglutide (seh-mah-glu-tide)\n\nBy the way, there is a shortage of this drug at the moment and I\u2019ll tell you why in a minute.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following me for any length of time, you know that I believe having healthy blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity is vital for health, fitness & longevity.\n\nThe better your blood sugar & insulin sensitivity \u2013 the more youthful you\u2019ll look, have more energy, more muscled and leaner.\n\nAdditionally, so many health ailments are related to high blood sugar and poor insulin sensitivity \u2013 for both your brain and organs.\n\nIn recent years, a drug called Ozempic, or the medication name of semaglutide, has become very popular for treating type 2 diabetes.\n\nIf you care about the details, semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist. GLP-1 is a natural hormone in your body.\n\nAnd simply stated, it works primarily by:\n\nlowering blood sugar levels.\n\nIt also slows down the digestion of your food, so you feel fuller longer.\n\nAnd finally, a side benefit is that it dramatically reduces your appetite.\n\nAnd this appetite reduction benefit is the primary reason many people are using it in recent times, even if they aren\u2019t diabetic.\n\nIn fact, this is why there\u2019s a shortage of this drug! Doctors or HRT clinics are prescribing it off-label for weight loss and NOT for blood sugar reduction in Type 2 diabetes.\n\nNegative Effects Of Ozempic\n\nOf course, like any drug, Ozempic does have negative effects, such as:\n\nPotential allergic reactions\n\nBut the truth is, these aren\u2019t horrible side effects and are probably dose-dependent.\n\nGranted, one major drawback to Ozempic is the cost, the stuff is expensive. It can easily cost you about $1000 a month if your insurance doesn\u2019t cover it because you\u2019re not diabetic \u2013 and most insurance don\u2019t because it\u2019s so expensive.\n\nAnd the biggest drawback is that you can\u2019t be using Ozempic/semaglutide (seh-mah-glu-tide) forever. And once you stop, trust me, you\u2019ll gain most or almost all the weight back because you didn\u2019t change your eating habits or exercise plan.\n\nYou simply took a shot, lost all your appetite, and didn\u2019t feel like eating all day long.\n\nThis can also cause malnutrition in many people over time because they aren\u2019t eating very many nutrients.\n\nWhat About Berberine?\n\nSo now comes Berberine. Which has also recently become popular and a lot of social media people are calling it the \u201cnatural alternative to Ozempic\u201d\n\nNow, if you haven\u2019t heard of Berberine, it\u2019s a compound found in several plants. It has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine.\n\nThe benefits of Berberine include:\n\nregulating blood sugar levels.\n\nsupports healthy cholesterol levels\n\nBerberine can actually help digestive health and gut flora.\n\nit also has been shown to support healthy inflammation.\n\nand yes, in some studies it also helps with weight loss.\n\nlastly, Berberine activates an enzyme called AMPK which may have anti-cancer and anti-aging properties\n\nSo far, this sounds great. Lots of healthy, natural positives and very few negatives.\n\nAnd the best part, no needles or injections, unlike Ozempic (semaglutide). It\u2019s just a pill you take 2-3x daily with meals\n\nPlus, it\u2019s way cheaper because it\u2019s a natural supplement and not an overpriced drug.\n\nInstead of $1000 a month, a good quality one that\u2019s dosed properly will cost around $40-$50 a month\n\nHOWEVER, it\u2019s important to know that by no means, is Berberine a \u201cnatural alternative\u201d to Ozempic! It\u2019s nowhere near as powerful for lowering blood sugar.\n\nAnd it will definitely NOT kill your appetite like Ozempic and thus, you won\u2019t have the big weight loss that you would when taking semaglutide.\n\nRemember, drugs are very powerful. The bigger the positive, usually the bigger the negative.\n\nThe bigger the reward, the bigger the risk.\n\nThe bottom line is that Semaglutide and berberine work differently, to help achieve healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nIf you have the resources, the money, and a doctor to prescribe Ozempic \u2013 then maybe you want to give it a short test run and see how you react to it.\n\nBut again, it\u2019s not a long-term solution.\n\nUse it for maybe a month or two. Lose weight and then stick to a healthy lifestyle to keep most of the weight off.\n\nBerberine For Healthy Blood Sugar\n\nAs for Berberine and having healthy blood sugar levels, I like it. I\u2019ve been using it for a couple of years, but I do so with other synergistic ingredients, such as:\n\nAnd a few other vitamins\n\nThe benefit of the above combination of ingredients is that the positive effects are much higher than taking Berberine alone.\n\nPlus, there are many additional benefits as well \u2013 such as liver health, insulin sensitivity in the muscle cells, and balanced insulin and blood sugar levels.\n\nI use a product called Blood Sugar Optimizer because it contains all of these ingredients and a few additional vitamins and minerals.\n\nEither way, improving your blood sugar will dramatically improve every aspect of your health, fitness, and longevity. So please do something today. Don\u2019t just listen, take action.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "YES! - I Want Healthy Blood Sugar Click HERE & Continue \u00bb It\u2019s been said that sugar addiction is like a drug\u2026 and can be worse than heroin, tobacco or cocaine. I\u2019m not sure about that \u2026\n\nHowever, what I AM certain about is the fact that all of these \u201cdrugs\u201d work on the same \u201caddiction pathway\u201d, which is through dopamine receptors.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve stated many times that the way you look and feel, is primarily based on your genetics and hormones \u2026 and similar \u201cchemicals\u201d in your body.\n\nNow, you can\u2019t change your genetics\u2026\n\nBut, you CAN change how your hormones work and thus, how, when or IF some of your genes are turned on (expressed) or off.\n\nAnd thus, today I\u2019m going to show you how you can turn OFF your \u201csugar addiction\u201d and cravings.\n\nAnd yes, for some people sugar \u201caddiction\u201d is a genetic thing.\n\nIn fact, we are ALL programmed to like sugar. It\u2019s just that some people are MORE prone to sugar and food addiction than others.\n\nI say this because I used to be totally and completely addicted to sugar, especially late at night or during times of stress.\n\nFor me, it was gummy bears and chocolate. I wasn\u2019t much into cake or similar pastries.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s interesting is the fact that I \u201cgenetically\u201d crave the salty, fried types of foods \u2013 NOT \u201csweets\u201d.\n\nSo there are two questions here:\n\nWHY was I so addicted to sugar, despite my natural genetic tendency to crave the opposite type of foods (salty and fatty)?\n\nHOW did I finally \u201ckill\u201d the addiction and stop all my sugar cravings?\n\nWhen your body is under stress \u2013 either emotional and/or physical \u2013 various \u201cstress\u201d hormones and chemicals become imbalanced.\n\nThis includes cortisol, adrenal hormones, serotonin, and dopamine to name a few.\n\nTwo things that help rebalance these chemicals and that\u2019s caffeine and sugar.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that these two substances temporarily improve this problem \u2026 but hours later cause an even bigger crash and imbalance, which continually fuels the addiction and cravings.\n\nAnd your body craves and prefers sugar, more than caffeine (coffee, tea, \u201cenergy\u201d drinks, etc.) because it increases insulin levels \u2014 which is the OPPOSITE of what you want.\n\nAnyway, my point here was that my STRESS was causing me to crave sugar, to help rebalance everything.\n\nThe second problem is that all of this sugar caused an increase in Candida yeast in my body. This growth is primarily found in your gut \u2013 it\u2019s different than when women get a \u201cyeast infection\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that Candida yeast feeds off sugar. So what happens is that:\n\nYou eat sugar and high-carb foods (sugar, bread, dairy, fruit, etc.)\n\nThe Candida in your gut eats all the sugar\n\nHours later YOU are craving more sugar again, to continue to feed the Candida\n\nIt\u2019s a never-ending cycle.\n\nSo what you first need to do is KILL the Candida yeast in your gut.\n\nYou need to eliminate all foods that have yeast. This means bread, beer, peanuts, aged cheeses, etc. This reduces any more yeast from coming into your body.\n\nThen you need to reduce and eliminate eating sugar to STOP FEEDING the existing yeast \u2013 this includes packaged foods, high carbohydrates, dairy, fruit, etc. \u2026 anything with sugar.\n\nFinally, you need to add in GOOD bacteria into your gut and you can do this by taking probiotics, and acidophilus pills. Eating fermented food is also great.\n\nYes, I know \u2026 there are lots of limitations here on what you can or can\u2019t eat.\n\nHowever, the end result is that your skin will improve, and you\u2019ll have more energy, and crave less sugar.\n\nUnfortunately, the main \u201cchallenge\u201d here is that it takes time to see results, so you must be patient.\n\nFor me, it took like 3-4 months.\n\nHowever, if you want to speed up the results, still enjoy some of your favorite \u201csugar\u201d foods occasionally and still kill your sugar cravings \u2013 then you can take some specific herbs and minerals that are proven to work by supporting healthy blood sugar levels, improving insulin sensitivity and ending almost all sugar cravings.\n\nThis includes supplements such as Chromium, vanadyl sulfate, alpha-lipoic acid, cinnamon extract, berberine, selenium, and a few others.\n\nA combination of these ingredients, taken 2-3x daily \u2026 literally stopped all of my sugar cravings within days, normalized my blood sugar, and helped decrease my body fat, especially around my belly.\n\nIt was almost magical and the secret was supporting healthy blood sugar.\n\nSome of us are more addicted to sugar and foods than others, however \u2014 we ALL like sugar. To kill the cravings, you need to\n\nManage your stress, while also supporting healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nEliminate Candida yeast in your body, which is fueling the sugar addiction\n\nTake herbs and minerals which can help rebalance your hormones, support healthy blood sugar and quickly reduce your sugar cravings & appetite.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Could apple cider vinegar be the one component missing from your lifestyle that could help you lose weight quickly and effectively? Braggs apple cider vinegar is used in households every day for a number of different uses, from making pickles to killing weeds to disinfecting countertops. It\u2019s been used over time as a way to cure virtually any health issue. Can it also cure people from obesity if it\u2019s just added to the diet?\n\nHow Could Braggs Help You Today?\n\nAccording to medical research that has come out in the last decade, one of the most promising uses of Braggs apple cider vinegary is in the treatment of blood sugar levels. The effect of the vinegar is that it can help to lower overall glucose levels so that the body becomes less resistant to insulin. In one recent study published by WebMD, people who suffered from Type 2 diabetes took 2 tablespoons of vinegar every day and their glucose levels in the morning were down as much as 6%. With less insulin resistance, the body can process foods better and store fewer calories as fat for later, helping with weight loss.\n\nApple cider vinegar is also believed to be able help control cholesterol levels. In animal studies, the evidence is clear that vinegar can control overall cholesterol levels, not just the bad LDL cholesterol that can get out of control. Human studies in this area are ongoing, but many tout the benefit of this product from their personal experiences in using it. Considering it has been used in this aspect for several generations, there must be a positive physical or emotional effect that occurs.\n\nCan Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar Help You Feel Fuller?\n\nHunger and weight are more than just physical concerns. They are also emotional concerns and an unsatisfied emotional state can quickly drive someone to feel the need to eat. In a 2005 study, a dozen people were given a piece of bread to eat that was soaked with small amounts of vinegar. Those who ate the small amounts with vinegar felt fuller and more satisfied than those who ate larger pieces of bread without vinegar.\n\nThe issue with Braggs apple cider vinegar, however, is the smell and the flavor of the product. It is often difficult to ingest, which is why Braggs uses an unfiltered, unheated process to create a lower 5% acidity than other brands with a more commercial, refined product. It is also unpasteurized, so you\u2019ll get all of the key nutrients from the product because it hasn\u2019t been cooked to death. The flavor is mild, the benefits can help people lose weight, and ultimately people feel more satisfied in the long term.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to lose weight and need a new edge, then Braggs apple cider vinegar can bring that edge back to you! Try taking some for yourself today to see if it really is the answer that you need to achieve your weight loss goals.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "Using Glucerna Shakes for Weight Loss | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss-se/using-glucerna-shakes-for-weight-loss/",
    "content": "Glucerna shakes are primarily designed for people with Type 2 Diabetes to help them lose the excess pounds without exacerbating their condition. Over the past few years, glucerna shakes have been used by people who do not have diabetes as a healthy way to lose the weight while fighting off the excess pangs of hunger.\n\nHowever, is this type of shake proper for those who do not have Type 2 Diabetes? This is an important question as glucerna shakes are becoming even more popular thanks to their overall effectiveness.\n\nThe Advantages of Glucerna Hunger Shake\n\nBasically, this type of shake contains plenty of proteins and slow burning carbohydrates to not only supply the body with what it needs, but also to help prevent people from snacking because they feel fuller throughout the day. Proteins and certain carbohydrates that are contained in the shake are slow to digest which means that they take longer to pass from the stomach and through the intestinal track.\n\nThis slow progress is actually good for the body as it will help absorb the proper nutrients while helping people to eat fewer calories. The shake is designed to help people stick to their healthy diets and it comes in a variety of flavors as well.\n\nThe Advantages of the Glucerna Shake\n\nThere are a number of benefits to having this particular shape as part of your daily diet program whether you have diabetes or not. They do have plenty of vitamins and minerals which make them an excellent supplement to any diet program.\n\nLow in Sugars: Because they are designed for people who have diabetes, they are low in processed sugars which means that they add very little in terms of calories that can turn into fat.\n\nHigh in Proteins: Proteins help with building muscle tissue which means that it does not turn into fat even if you are not exercising as part of your weight loss plan. However, for those who are exercising, this is an excellent way to keep up muscle strength and tone while losing even more weight.\n\nSlow Burning Carbohydrates: By emphasizing carbohydrates that are slow to burn, this means that the body is not turning the energy into excess fat. Instead, the slow burning aspect allows the body to burn the calories as they are consumed.\n\nFeel Fuller: By feeling fuller you have less of a tendency to snack between meals which mean that fewer calories are consumed. The fewer the calories, the more your body will turn to the fat reserves to burn them away instead.\n\nHowever, while the advantages of glucerna shakes are certainly real, they should not be used to replace complete meals for the body. Instead, they should be used with meals to help prevent snacking or other excessive eating which in turn creates a leaner, healthier body.\n\nGlucerna shakes work well for those who have diabetes and those who do not as they help prevent sugar spikes. However, they should be used properly as part of your overall diet plan and not as a replacement for the proper nutrition that eating three healthy meals a day brings.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Of course, most people know that sugar in any form isn\u2019t really good for you. This includes regular sugar and natural \u201ccane\u201d sugars, as well as syrups and high-fructose corn syrups, which is found in so many products.\n\nSadly, Americans on average, consume almost 70 lbs of sugar each year. That\u2019s about 7 tablespoons DAILY!\n\nAnd you may know that all of this extra sugar leads to obesity, in addition to other health problems such as blood pressure, cholesterol, inflammation, pain, fatigue, and so forth.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s damaging to all of your organs, and your brain.\n\nHowever, most people don\u2019t realize that blood sugar problems and bad insulin levels accelerate the aging process and cause wrinkles.\n\nWrinkles, deep lines, and sagging skin are a partial byproduct of the process known as glycation, in which excess sugar molecules attach themselves to collagen fibers and ultimately cause them to lose their strength and flexibility.\n\nWe call these bondings AGEs or advanced glycosylation end products.\n\nThe result?\u2026 Your skin becomes less elastic and more vulnerable to sun damage, fine lines, and sagging.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT Just Sugar That\u2019s The Problem\n\nSugar and primarily, other high-glycemic carbohydrates such as bread, starches, potatoes, baked goods, pasta, desserts, and soda, are rapidly converted to glucose in your bloodstream. Your body then secretes extra insulin to help lower the blood sugar and things just keep getting worse and worse.\n\nOver time, your body becomes less sensitive to insulin and thus, your pancreas has to secrete, even more, just to lower your blood sugar levels back down.\n\nThe bottom line is that the higher your blood sugar and insulin levels, the more wrinkles you\u2019ll have over time \u2014 in addition to all the other health ailments I mentioned.\n\nAs a side note, all of this damage to your skin is also negatively affecting your scalp and thus, causes hair loss and thinning.\n\nBest Supplements For Healthy Blood Sugar\n\nOne supplement that helps support healthy blood sugar and more specifically, decreases glycation which causes wrinkles, is Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA). You can take it topically, but it\u2019s far more effective and less expensive when taken orally as a supplement.\n\nAdditional ingredients that are good for BOTH blood sugar and wrinkles are Vitamin E, Biotin, Pantothenic Acid, Selenium, Chromium, and Trans-Resveratrol.\n\nNow, this is such an important topic \u2013 not just for your overall health, but just for vanity reasons.\n\nI have another article you can read, entitled \u201c10 To Support Healthy Ways To Lower Blood Sugar\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, if you just want faster results with less effort, you can try a natural formula that already contains all ingredients I just mentioned, plus about 8 other clinically researched ones that will help support healthy blood sugar naturally, while reducing your wrinkles.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/7-tips-to-get-ripped-abs-gain-muscle-by-improving-insulin-sensitivity/",
    "content": "A few years ago, I had a client who was getting ready for a big movie, and in it, he needed to show off his abs. He was referred to me by another actor client of mine. I\u2019m not here to drop names or reveal anything and it\u2019s not important. However, this actor came to me in a very angry state of mind and said:\n\nI can\u2019t get rid of the F***ing belly fat. This a-hole trainer of mine has me working out 2 hours daily, I\u2019m on like no f***ing carbs. I have no energy. No strength and after all this f***ing work, I still don\u2019t have a 6-pack abs. I\u2019ve got 8 G-D damn weeks left to get ready for the movie. What f*** am I doing wrong?!!\n\nAs you can tell, he was very colorful with is words and he was also very angry and frustrated. Which happens to many people who sacrifice so much and still aren\u2019t able to get abs.\n\nPlus, the problem with chronic low-carb diets is that it impairs muscle growth. It lowers thyroid levels, which decreases your metabolism and fat burning. It can cause other negative hormonal imbalances, which is bad for anyone who wants to build muscle and burn fat.\n\nHowever, the benefit of a low-carb diet is healthy blood sugar levels and insulin secretion. But, your main goal for building muscle and getting lean is to mainly focus on improving insulin sensitivity.\n\nSo, getting back to my actor client. Since he was in a rush, I didn\u2019t do immediate blood and hormone tests. He was very impatient and pissed off. So I told him to make the following changes, which he could take action on immediately and so can you.\n\nAnd the goal with these 7 simple steps is to improve insulin sensitivity, which will help burn off belly fat, improve your energy and reduce inflammation \u2013 which will further burn off even more fat.\n\nAnd a side benefit is also more muscle growth.\n\n1 \u2013 Exercise Less, But More Often\n\nI immediately cut his workouts in half but had him do it more often. He was working out once daily for 2 hours. I told him to cut it down to 40-60 minutes, but twice daily.\n\nEvery time you workout, you improve insulin sensitivity. This way, he got twice-daily improvements, and the positive effects lasted about 4-6 hours. So, most of the day his insulin sensitivity was much better.\n\nBy the way, if he could only get to the gym once daily, that was fine. The second workout was walking, 20-40 minutes.\n\n2 \u2013 Eat Carbs Around The Workout\n\nI told him to still have some good carbs, but only before and post-workout. The rest of the time, it was just protein and fat, no carbs.\n\nWith his carb-containing meals, he ate the protein, fat, and vegetables FIRST and lastly, the carbs. Which consisted of yams, lentils, white rice, or fruit.\n\n4 \u2013 Take Herbs, Vitamins & Minerals\n\nPeople who have poor insulin sensitivity and also want to lose belly fat, increase energy levels, and so forth, are typically deficient in certain vitamins and minerals. Either lacking from the diet and/or their body just doesn\u2019t absorb them well.\n\nAnd they also respond extremely well to specific herbs designed for improving insulin sensitivity and having healthy blood sugar. You can see a big difference when using them.\n\nThere are a few specific ones, but to keep it simple \u2013 I gave him an \u201call-in-one\u201d formula that I use myself.\n\nHe had no healthy fish oils in his diet, which is a major problem. I told him to eat wild-caught salmon at least 3x weekly and to also add in about 3-6 grams of fish oil daily.\n\nI told him to have a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, 3x daily.\n\nFinally, to add in some psyllium fiber, twice daily.\n\nMost of these changes you can make right away. With the special healthy blood sugar vitamins, fish oil, apple cider vinegar, and psyllium fiber, you can order and start using them in a few short days and they\u2019ll make a big difference and accelerate the process.\n\nAnd as far as his results, about 30 days later he had a 4 pack of abs. Not yet his 6-pack.\n\nWe had another 30 days left to achieve that goal and in a future article, I\u2019ll let you know what we did for that.\n\nKeep in mind that he lost only 2 lbs to go from blurry abs to a 4 pack. This means he gained some muscle AND lost fat at the same time. While he spent less time in the gym.\n\nWhy?\u2026 because he optimized his hormones and wasn\u2019t overstressing the body.\n\nIt\u2019s a win-win and 30 days later, he was no longer angry and cursing. He was excited and hopeful and that\u2019s where I want you to be.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "So, there\u2019s a lot of misinformation about what causes blood sugar problems\n\nAnd the worse part is when you have two \u201cexperts\u201d who contradict each other and thus, causing most of us a lot of frustration when it comes to getting and STAYING healthy!\n\nIn fact, this is why I created my blog and these articles \u2014 to help give you clarity, reduce the frustration, eliminate the misinformation when it comes to health, and thus, make your life easier.\n\nThis way, getting healthy, looking, and feeling young \u2026 can actually be fun because you\u2019ll get results with less effort, time, and money.\n\nAnd the best part, is you can do it naturally WITHOUT expensive and harmful drugs.\n\nNow, I mention all of this because a lot of people think that you need to have a low-carbohydrate diet or eat lots of protein, no fats, and so forth when it comes to managing your blood sugar.\n\nUnfortunately, this is partly true and sadly, most of the information is completely misguided and wrong.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s get right to the point and discuss today\u2019s topic \u2013 the #1 food you should be eating with ALL of your meals, to help support healthy blood sugar.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started: What you need to do is eat some FAT with all of your meals.\n\nHowever, the problem here is that people are either\n\nEating NO fats, because they\u2019ve been misled and brainwashed thinking it\u2019s bad for them and it\u2019ll make them fat.\n\nThey eat the WRONG types of fats and thus, it\u2019s making things worse and is actually the CAUSE for getting them fat and making them diabetic.\n\nSo let\u2019s discuss both of these quickly.\n\nProblem 1 \u2013 Eating NO Fats\n\nIf you don\u2019t have some fat in your meals, the carbohydrates you eat will quickly shoot up your blood sugar and thus, your insulin levels.\n\nThis is NOT what you want because, over time, your insulin receptors become \u201cinsensitive\u201d and thus, your body needs to produce even MORE insulin to get the same \u201chealthy blood sugar\u201d effects.\n\nThe benefit is that if you eat some healthy fats with all of your meals, you will quickly BLUNT the blood sugar spikes.\n\nThis is because fat slows digestion. Thus, you\u2019ll lower the glycemic index and load of the meal.\n\nhealthy blood sugar after your meals\n\nand healthier insulin receptors\n\nProblem 2 \u2013 Eating The WRONG Fats\n\nThe second problem is those who do eat fats with their meals, they eat the WRONG types of fats.\n\nSo in the movie \u201cForks over Knives\u201d, Dr. Greger1 states that \u201cfat makes you insulin resistant\u201d. This is based on studies performed in the 1930s where a group of participants ate a \u201cfat-rich diet\u2026 in vegetable oils, butter, mayonnaise, and cream.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into all the details. However, I mention this because these are NOT healthy fats. These are crappy fats.\n\nThese are manmade fats. They\u2019re fake. Not natural. These fats are treated, heated, hydrogenated, and trans-fats.\n\nYES, these fats are bad for you and will cause blood sugar problems, in addition to dozens of other health problems.\n\nWhat you want to eat are some healthy fats:\n\nRaw nuts and seeds (hemp, flax, etc.)\n\nExtra virgin Macadamia nut and Olive oil\n\nDon\u2019t heat your oils because it changes the structure of the molecule. And if you\u2019re going to cook, stick with Coconut oil and macadamia nut oil.\n\nAlso, fats create and improve your hormones, which is the KEY to a healthier body. By the way, you don\u2019t need much fat with your meals.\n\nEat between 20%-30% of your total calories from healthy fats. And that\u2019s it.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.forksoverknives.com/fat-insulin-resistance-blood-sugar",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to quickly talk about Berberine and supporting healthy blood sugar levels:\n\nWarnings & Side Effects\n\nHow To Make It Work Better & Remove Potential Negatives\n\nOne of the main actions of berberine is to activate an enzyme inside cells called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).\n\nThis enzyme is sometimes referred to as a \u201cmetabolic master switch\u201d.\n\nIt is found in the cells of various organs, including the brain, muscles, kidneys, heart, and liver. This enzyme plays a major role in regulating metabolism.\n\nBerberine also affects various other molecules inside cells, and may even affect which genes are turned on or off.\n\nWhat Are The Benefits\n\nBerberine does help with weight loss and promoting healthy cholesterol levels.\n\nHowever, the main benefit or the reason people take berberine is for supporting healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nIt seems to work via multiple different mechanisms:\n\nDecreases insulin resistance, making insulin more effective.\n\nIncreases glycolysis, which helps the body break down sugars inside cells.\n\nDecrease sugar production in the liver.\n\nSlows the breakdown of carbohydrates in the gut.\n\nIt even increases the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut.\n\nBased on various studies covered in the video (links below), berberine promotes healthy fasting blood sugar levels by 20% and long-term results by 12%.\n\nIt\u2019s also been shown to work similarly to prescription medications, which is another bonus.\n\nMost importantly, berberine works even better with other blood sugar-supporting herbs, which I\u2019ll cover below.\n\nOf course, a healthy lifestyle takes precedence over everything, which I\u2019m sure you already know.\n\nDosage & Side Effects\n\nEven though it\u2019s a natural herbal supplement, it still has negative side effects and many times, as with everything, it\u2019s dose-related.\n\nThe effective dose is between 500 to 1500 mg daily. If taken at a higher dose, it should be spread throughout the day. For example, 500 mg, 2 or 3x daily.\n\nIt should be taken about 30 minutes before a carbohydrate-containing meal.\n\nObviously, the higher the dose, the more effective it is. However, the higher dosages also have digestive related side-effects such as:\n\nDiarrhea and/or constipation\n\nAcid reflux or heartburn\n\nMy suggestion is to start with 500 mg daily for a couple of weeks and see how you feel, before taking a higher dose.\n\nBut, there are ways to make it more effective and not have any extra negative effects.\n\nHow To Make It Work Better & Safer\n\nIf you utilize a specific few, sugar-optimizing herbs together, you get much better results, but without the negatives of a higher dose of just ONE ingredient.\n\nThus, stacking or using Berberine with other clinically researched ingredients, such as:\n\nAlpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)\n\nA few key vitamins and minerals\n\nPromotes healthy blood sugar control and even better results\u2026 but without any of the negative side effects.\n\nOf course, taking each of these individually is going to be a hassle, inconvenient and expensive.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there are a couple of products that utilize berberine with these other compounds in ONE easy convenient pill.\n\nI use Blood Sugar Optimizer, which contains all these ingredients, in scientifically researched dosages and forms, so you can get the best results with the lowest side effects.\n\nRemember, all of this should be utilized with an improved lifestyle \u2014 more natural foods, daily exercise, and stress reduction.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-sugar/blood-sugar-diabetes-warning-hemoglobin-a1c-is-not-reliable/",
    "content": "Today\u2019s topic is important for anyone concerned about their blood sugar levels, weight loss, and who wants to avoid serious health problems\n\nSpecifically, it\u2019s about how current blood testing to see if you have a blood sugar problem is actually not very accurate.\n\nThis is personally very important to me as well because it affected my own blood tests a few years ago.\n\nI did a blood test and it showed \u201chigh\u201d A1c levels, which put me in the \u2018diabetic\u2019 range.\n\nThis was even though my fasting blood sugar and my post-meal blood sugar levels were all very normal and in fact, in a lower, optimal range.\n\nNone of this made sense because I rarely have anything with sugar, other than 1-2 pieces of fruit, a few times a week. And, I\u2019m always under 10% body fat.\n\nIt worried me at first until I did more research and found a fatal flaw with A1c tests that most people, including your doctor, don\u2019t know about.\n\nSo if you\u2019re concerned about your blood sugar levels\u2026 or if you\u2019d like to avoid serious health problems, please make sure you read carefully.\n\nDifferent Ways Of Testing Blood Sugar\n\nThere are different ways to test your blood sugar. In addition to simply living a healthier and longer life, by having healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nThe most common is fasting blood glucose tests (FBG). Basically, you don\u2019t eat anything for at least 8 hours and then do a blood test and they see your fasting \u201cglucose\u201d levels. This is typically done first thing in the morning. You see this all the time with a regular blood test.\n\nHealthy levels are between 70-100 mg/dL. I prefer it to be at the lower end of this.\n\nUnfortunately, this way does NOT tell you how things work in the REAL world \u2013 how your body deals with sugar after you eat a regular meal.\n\nIn this situation, you\u2019re given sugar, about 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. You drink and then your blood sugar is tested at 1 and 2 hours to see how your body handles all of this sugar.\n\nI don\u2019t like this method either because, in the real world, nobody has 32 oz (4 cups) of soda or something else with that much glucose\u2026 all at once\u2026 by itself \u2026 and without any other food.\n\nThus, this isn\u2019t very reliable.\n\nThis is how diabetics do it. You eat a meal, you do a blood test with a simple glucometer, and you see what your blood sugar levels are after your meal.\n\nThis is more accurate in my opinion because this is the REAL world.\n\nOf course, the average person isn\u2019t going to be doing this. However, this is how I do it with my professional athletes.\n\nThe hemoglobin A1c test has become more popular over the past 10-15 years. This is done because it\u2019s thought to be more accurate and reliable than the \u201cfasting blood glucose\u201d (FBG) test.\n\nAnd also a lot cheaper and easier than the older, \u201coral glucose tolerance test\u201d (OGTT).\n\nBasically, A1c is a \u201csnapshot\u201d or the \u201caverage\u201d blood sugar levels for the past 60-90 days.\n\nSpecifically, the A1c test measures what percentage of your hemoglobin \u2014 a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen \u2014 is coated with sugar (glycated). The higher your A1C level, the poorer your blood sugar control, and the higher your risk.\n\nIn theory, this makes sense and seems like a better indicator. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a big problem with A1c levels that most people won\u2019t tell you and your doctors don\u2019t know.\n\nWhy A1c Is Not Reliable\n\nThe main problem is that how long your hemoglobin survives, varies greatly in people. And, I\u2019ve seen this in my professional athletes many years ago, including myself.\n\nFor example, one study1 in Diabetes Journals showed that red blood cells live longer than average at normal blood sugars. Researchers found that the lifetime of hemoglobin cells of diabetics turned over in as few as 81 days, while they lived as long as 146 days in non-diabetics.\n\nThis proves that the assumption that everyone\u2019s red blood cells live for three months is false, and that hemoglobin A1c can\u2019t be relied upon as a blood sugar marker.\n\nIn a person with normal blood sugar, hemoglobin will be around for a lot longer, which means it will accumulate more sugar.\n\nTHUS, in normal, non-diabetic people, this will drive up the A1c test result \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t mean that the person had too much sugar in their blood.\n\nIt just means their hemoglobin lived longer and thus, accumulated more sugar.\n\nThe result is that people with normal blood sugar often test with unexpectedly high A1c levels.\n\nAnd I bring this up because this is exactly what happened to me a few years ago.\n\nIn fact, I rarely test myself for only A1c levels \u2013 but I had to do it for a life insurance test and it was \u201cflagged\u201d as \u201ctoo high\u201d.\n\nThe More Accurate Way To Do It\n\nSo now I\u2019d like to discuss a more accurate way to do all of this.\n\nI\u2019ve always stated that the human body is very complicated. It\u2019s wrong to think that ONE drug \u2026 or ONE type of diet or piece of food\u2026 or ONE type of exercise \u2026 or ONE vitamin\u2026 or ONE specific blood or medical test, will somehow magically fix or predict a health problem.\n\nWith my clients, I test multiple factors when it comes to determining your TRUE \u201cblood sugar health\u201d.\n\nFasting Blood Glucose\n\nPost-Meal Blood Sugar (3 meals daily for 3 days)\n\nThe post-meal is the most accurate in my opinion but also takes more time and effort.\n\nI then look at the averages, the big picture of these 4 tests.\n\nIf only one of them is \u201chigh\u201d, then I\u2019m not too concerned.\n\nHowever, if 3 or 4 of them all show high levels, then we have a clear indicator that your body is not processing sugar correctly \u2014 at the cellular level, pancreas health, and also insulin sensitivity.\n\nNow you need to take action by making some important lifestyle changes and improvements.\n\nMy point with today\u2019s article is that the usual methods of testing for blood sugar are all flawed when used individually.\n\nI know many people who have had higher A1c levels, while their fasting blood sugar and post-meal blood sugar levels were all great.\n\nTheir doctors would warn them about blood sugar problems and yet, these people were living healthy lives.\n\nYou need to test all 4 factors, and 3 of them can be done all at once, with a simple blood test. You just have to ask your doctor to test for\n\nFasting Blood Glucose\n\nAnd if you want to support healthy blood sugar levels, you\u2019ll need to make simple lifestyle changes\u2026 and you can also learn how my own uncle supported healthy blood sugar levels naturally and lost 34 lbs at the same time.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/4/931.full",
