    "content": "Today you\u2019ll discover the primary causes of hair loss and one BIG cause that most people aren\u2019t aware of, but one that you can mostly control with simple steps in your lifestyle.\n\nCauses Of Hair Loss / Balding\n\nThere are many factors that cause hair loss.\n\nGenetics plays a massive role\n\nMajor hormonal factors \u2013 mainly hormonal imbalance.\n\nHave you ever heard the term, \u201cshort, fat, bald, and hairy\u201d?\n\nThe short and fat is from high estrogen.\n\nThe bald and hairy are from high DHT levels.\n\nWhen both Estrogen and DHT levels are elevated, Testosterone is greatly REDUCED \u2013 which we do NOT want.\n\nIf you do NOT have any DHT (dihydrotestosterone) \u2013 then you will not go bald. This is how the drugs called Propecia/Proscar work (finasteride).\n\nOf course, eliminating DHT later in life does not guarantee a full head of hair.\n\nIt\u2019ll surely decrease the speed of hair loss, slow it down, stop it, and maybe even reverse it\u2026 Especially if you start early enough.\n\nBut again, it\u2019s not a cure.\n\nInteresting Hair Loss Study\n\nA long time ago I read a study that about 40%-50% of Japanese men who came to the US started to go bald and were losing their hair.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a few generations later. It was the same people, so it was something in America that was causing the hair loss.\n\nWell, there is \u201cepigenetics\u201d \u2013 which basically states that your environment or lifestyle can trigger or turn on genes.\n\nSomething in your EXTERNAL world triggers and turns them on.\n\nSo, What\u2019s The Cause Of Hair Loss?\n\nLots of factors \u2013 stress is a big one and the negative hormonal changes that come with it.\n\nBut more importantly, science has repeatedly linked inflammation as a major factor as well.\n\nHigh DHT also causes inflammation \u2013 in the prostate, but also the skin and scalp.\n\nBut the point is that inflammation for sure plays both a direct and indirect role in hair loss\u2026 as well as lots of other health problems.\n\nSo, How To Reduce Inflammation?\n\nA lot of factors cause inflammation \u2013 lifestyle, stress, balancing hormones, the foods you eat, herbs and vitamins you can take, proper sleep, etc.\n\nTaking herbal extracts such as curcumin, ginger, Boswellia, Green Tea, Pine Bark, Astragalus, Resveratrol, Quercetin, and a few others can help support a healthy and youthful inflammatory response.\n\nI recommend Inflame & Pain Relief\u2122, which contains all the above key ingredients, at the correct clinically proven dosages\u2026 and will help promote a healthy inflammatory response.\n\nYou may not be able to change your genetics, but you can improve inflammatory responses.\n\nIt\u2019ll improve both your hairline and your health!\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy inflammation & pain relief\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3489839/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4432067/\n\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/5-alpha-reductase-deficiency/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5%CE%B1-Reductase_2_deficiency\n\nhttps://thethaiger.com/hot-news/balding-once-a-caucasian-problem-grows-in-asian-men\n\nhttps://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2000/10/26/general/hair-today-gone-tomorrow/\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003705#:~:text=Hair%20loss%20is%20a%20common,because%20of%20its%20toxic%20profile.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2138175/\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/548754\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180508144955.htm",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/creatine-hair-loss-real-scientific-truth/",
    "content": "I remember the first time I found out about creatine. It was super expensive like 4 oz was $100 or $120, and you know what, I HAD to have it. It was the early 90s, I didn\u2019t have much money, I gave it a try and well, it never worked like it claimed it would \u2013 at least not for me.\n\nHowever, now it\u2019s 2025 and there are numerous studies linking creatine to increased strength, muscle, and athletic performance, as well as improved recovery post-workout.\n\nAnd the good news is that creatine is one of the most studied sports supplements in history and has a safe track record \u2013 IF you use the correct dose and the right type \u2013 which, I\u2019ll tell you about in a minute.\n\nHowever, today\u2019s topic is about creatine and hair loss, which is what a few of my readers have asked about.\n\nIs there any proof either scientifically with clinical studies, or empirically with real-life feedback?\n\nCreatine And Hair Loss Connection \u2013 Scientific Evidence\n\nThere\u2019s only ONE study in 2009, connecting creatine to hair loss.2 It consisted of only 20 rugby players who took 25 grams of creatine daily for 3 weeks.\n\nThe researchers found that creatine may increase the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is believed to be ONE of the hormones behind male pattern baldness in men genetically predisposed to hair loss.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll give you a link to another very important article about the REAL cause of hair loss, at the end of this one because DHT is NOT the primary hormone.\n\nHowever, the study did NOT prove that creatine can actually cause hair loss. Not only did the research not mention hair loss, but it was also extremely small with only 20 people, and limited to a very narrow time frame, only 3 weeks.\n\nLastly, the increase in DHT was not large and was still within the normal range.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: No, taking creatine will not cause hair loss! Genetics aside, hair loss has a hormonal and inflammatory cause. As stated earlier, I\u2019ll give you the link to an important article about hair loss and everything you need to know about it.\n\nIf you do a search online, you will see a few guys saying that they noticed hair loss when they started taking creatine. However, this is all anecdotal and what someone thinks or feels. It\u2019s not scientific in any way, shape, or form.\n\nThese same guys have stated that when they stopped taking creatine, their hair loss stopped and the hair grew back.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: IF you are concerned about hair loss, then my suggestion is don\u2019t do anything that could potentially turn ON or accelerate the process, and thus, just do NOT take creatine or take a lower dose \u2013 3-5 grams daily. No loading and make sure you cycle it. Then, see how your body responds.\n\nWith that said, I have an entire series of hair loss articles \u2013 causes and solutions. You can check out the first one, which is \u201cHow Baldness & Hormones are connected\u201d.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407788/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19741313",

    "content": "So far you\u2019ve learned that men who are losing their hair, typically have\n\nHigher DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)\n\nHIGHER female hormones (estrogen, progesterone & prolactin)\n\nWhat\u2019s The \u201cOpposite\u201d Of Testosterone?\n\nNow, before I start today\u2019s article\u2026 let me ask you a question: What hormone do you think is the \u201copposite\u201d of Testosterone?\u2026\n\nWhen I ask this question, most people will say \u201cestrogen\u201d.\n\nActually, the opposite of testosterone is your stress hormone, cortisol!\n\nThis is a MAJOR problem and causing factor for almost everything related to aging, especially as it pertains to hair loss.\n\nAs this stress hormone goes up, your testosterone drops faster than a brick in your swimming pool.\n\nAnd this is nature\u2019s way of preventing you from \u201cprocreating\u201d and having babies.\n\nBased on thousands of years of evolution, your body thinks that because you are under a lot of stress, there must be a shortage of food or shelter\n\n\u2026or some other problem which can cause death.\n\nThus, it\u2019s not the best time for you to have babies.\n\nSo as cortisol levels go up, your testosterone drops and so does your sex drive.\n\nAdditionally, stress causes inflammation in the body.\n\nAnd inflammation, known in pattern balding as perifollicular inflammation, plays a significant, perhaps the most significant role in hair loss.\n\nNot only does it cause major hormonal imbalances, but it also signals your body to produce various \u201chair loss\u201d causing factors, enzymes, peptides and so forth.\n\nAgain, I want to keep things simple since I know most of us don\u2019t care about the boring medical stuff.\n\nWhat we want are more head hair, better testosterone, and a higher sex drive.\n\nHow To Reduce Cortisol\n\nSo, how do we reduce cortisol?\n\nSleep as much as your body requires. Thus, don\u2019t wake up to an alarm clock every day. If you\u2019re sleep-deprived, go to bed earlier.\n\nEat 5-6 small meals daily to balance your blood sugar, which helps lower cortisol.\n\nMake sure you do something every day to relax, your own personal \u201chour of power\u201d. That may be going for a walk outside, getting a massage, meditating, stretching, watching something funny, or even taking a quick nap.\n\nTake cortisol-reducing supplements \u2013 such as 3000 mg of Vitamin C daily, Ashwagandha extract, Rhodiola, and Phosphatidylserine.\n\nSo now you know that your goal is to\n\nIncrease your testosterone\n\nAnd decrease stress hormones such as cortisol\n\nAs you balance these hormones, you\u2019ll see dramatic improvements in your health, testosterone, and hair loss.\n\nBy the way, there\u2019s one other problem with stress hormones \u2013 they screw around with your thyroid levels, which causes hair loss and fat again\u2026 and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll quickly cover in my next article.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Improving Your Hormones & Reversing + Avoiding HAIR LOSS\n\nAs you get older, starting in your mid 20's (yup, that early!)... you start to have negative changes in your hormones, such as:\n\nlower male hormones (total and free testosterone, DHEA, etc.)\n\nhigher female hormones (estrogens, prolactin, etc.)\n\nhigh stress hormones (cortisol, adrenalin, DHT, etc.)\n\nAll of these negative hormonal changes can lead to less muscle, more belly fat, a decrease in libido and HAIR LOSS!\n\nAnd the secret is to reverse the negative hormonal changes, so you can have similar healthy & youthful levels like you did in your teenage years and early 20's - when you were NOT having any of these negative problems.\n\nThe best part is you can do this naturally - discover how...",
