    "content": "The other day, I saw a short video of Chris Hemsworth talking about his anxiety \u2014 and it hit home.\n\nIt reminded me of my own personal battles with anxiety throughout the years.\n\nThat\u2019s why this article is specifically for men.\n\nAnxiety is destroying your health, hormones, relationships \u2013 even your sex drive \u2013 and most guys don\u2019t even realize it.\n\nThe Hidden Epidemic: Men & Anxiety\n\nYes, anxiety is normal \u2014 for both men and women.\n\nBut research shows that anxiety levels in men have skyrocketed over the past few decades.\n\nAnd it\u2019s deadly. Over 80% of suicides are by men.\n\nI\u2019ve had three close friends commit suicide.\n\nOne of them? I was the last person he spoke to.\n\nThe problem is \u2014 men don\u2019t talk about anxiety. We bottle it up, isolate ourselves, and pretend everything\u2019s fine.\n\nWhy Anxiety Destroys Your Health & Hormones\n\nWhen you\u2019re anxious, your body produces more cortisol and adrenaline.\n\nThese stress hormones increase inflammation, disrupt sleep patterns, and lower testosterone and growth hormone levels.\n\nThat affects everything \u2014 from your mood to your sex life.\n\nMany guys struggle with erectile dysfunction, job pressure, and money problems. Anxiety feeds into all of it.\n\nPoor sleep from anxiety further lowers testosterone and dopamine levels \u2014 and it becomes a vicious cycle.\n\nMy Personal Struggles With Anxiety\n\nLike many of you, I\u2019ve battled anxiety most of my life.\n\nI used to stutter, sweat excessively, and overthink everything.\n\nI even lost erections during sex \u2014 Viagra didn\u2019t help because anxiety blocked my body from relaxing.\n\nAt the time, I felt hopeless.\n\nBut I\u2019ve since learned how to manage my anxiety naturally \u2014 and I\u2019ll share everything that helped.\n\nYou\u2019re Not Alone \u2014 Everyone Deals With It\n\nFrom millionaire CEOs to pro athletes, I\u2019ve seen it all.\n\nOn the outside, they look confident. But inside?\n\nThey\u2019re anxious, stressed, and overwhelmed.\n\nEven Chris Hemsworth \u2014 Thor himself \u2014 struggled with anxiety on film sets.\n\nWhat helped him (and me)? A shift in perspective. What you focus on grows.\n\nSimple Tools That Helped Me Beat Anxiety\n\nHere are a few of the most effective tools I\u2019ve used over the years:\n\nChange your focus: When something bad happens, ask yourself: \u201cWhat else could this mean?\u201d It shifts your brain from stress to problem-solving.\n\nRemind yourself: \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d Sounds simple, but it\u2019s powerful. Most of the things we worry about never actually happen.\n\nUse natural supplements: I don\u2019t recommend drugs like Xanax \u2014 they work short-term, but the rebound anxiety is worse.\n\nProVanax \u2013 Balances dopamine, serotonin, and GABA\n\nMagnesium Glycinate \u2013 Calms the nervous system\n\nVitamin D3 + K2 \u2013 Supports hormones & mood\n\nFish Oil \u2013 Reduces inflammation and anxiety\n\nThese are natural, safe, and work with your body.\n\nI\u2019ve used them for years and noticed a big difference in mood, sleep, and focus.\n\nEven Talking Helps (Yes, Even to AI)\n\nIf you don\u2019t have someone to talk to, just speak to ChatGPT.\n\nSeriously \u2014 it\u2019s judgment-free and available 24/7.\n\nI use the voice chat mode, and it feels like talking to a friend or therapist.\n\nJust say what\u2019s on your mind. Sometimes getting it out of your head is all it takes to feel better. Especially for guys \u2014 we need to talk more.\n\nFinal Thoughts: You\u2019re Not Broken\n\n50% of anxiety is genetic.\n\nThat\u2019s not your fault \u2014 but it is your responsibility to manage it.\n\nSupport your body with the right tools, change your focus, and build new habits.\n\nTake action, talk to someone, and make one small change today.\n\nAnd remember: This too shall pass.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/stress-cortisol/this-hormone-is-slowly-killing-men/",
    "content": "There\u2019s one hormone that, when chronically elevated:\n\nLowers testosterone and other youth hormones\n\nIncreases belly and visceral fat\n\nRaises blood pressure and blood sugar\n\nCauses muscle loss and weakness\n\nAccelerates wrinkles and hair loss\n\nLeads to anxiety and depression\n\nBasically, it accelerates aging and is indirectly linked to many health problems, diseases, and cancers.\n\nDo you know what hormone this is?\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s Cortisol \u2014 and related stress hormones.\n\nWhy Cortisol Becomes a Problem\n\nSome cortisol is good and necessary. In fact, without cortisol, you could die.\n\nBut these days, most of us are under chronic stress \u2014 life is fast, busy, and overwhelming. And this is especially true for men today.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to give you 7 simple, proven ways to lower cortisol and boost your youth hormones \u2014 so you can look and feel younger, more confident, and less stressed.\n\n1. Fix Your Breathing\n\nMost people breathe shallow and fast, especially under stress.\n\nWe\u2019re hunched over screens, barely breathing right. So, a few times during the day, just stop and breathe deeply from your stomach.\n\nTry this: Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds. Do this for just 3\u20135 cycles \u2014 about one minute.\n\nYou can do it anywhere \u2014 at work, in the car, wherever. It signals your brain to relax, improves blood pressure, and lowers stress.\n\n2. Control Your Blood Sugar\n\nCarbs lower cortisol, which is why we crave sugar when stressed.\n\nBut blood sugar spikes and crashes increase cortisol \u2014 it\u2019s stressful for your body.\n\nTo stabilize your blood sugar:\n\nEat more protein, vegetables, fruits, and fiber-rich carbs like legumes and yams.\n\nWalk for 10\u201315 minutes after meals.\n\nTake blood sugar-lowering herbs like Berberine, ALA, Bitter Melon.\n\nYou can try my favorite supplement to help control blood sugar.\n\n3. Get Morning Sunlight\n\nYour body runs on rhythms, and morning sunlight helps reset that clock.\n\nJust 10\u201315 minutes of natural sunlight helps regulate cortisol, improve mood, and reset your sleep-wake cycle.\n\nThis boosts cortisol in the morning and lowers it at night \u2014 the way it should be.\n\nNo sunglasses. I go outside every morning for a 15\u201320 minute walk.\n\n4. Lift Weights \u2014 Not Just Your Stress\n\nYes, exercise raises cortisol short-term, but it lowers it long-term, if done right.\n\nAvoid excessive cardio.\n\nWalking is great. So is strength training.\n\nLift weights 3\u20134x per week, ideally every other day. Keep it short, focused, and under an hour.\n\n5. Use Adaptogens & Herbs\n\nAdaptogens are nature\u2019s stress buffers. Some of the best cortisol-reducing herbs include:\n\nMy favorite cortisol-reducing supplement is Stress & Cortisol Relief \u2013 you can give it a try and see how it works for you.\n\n6. Prioritize Deep Sleep\n\nSleep is when your body heals and resets, especially hormones.\n\nPoor sleep = high cortisol.\n\nGo to bed earlier \u2014 I set a \u201csleep alarm\u201d to remind myself.\n\nSleep as long as your body needs. Don\u2019t wake to an alarm.\n\nKeep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool.\n\nTake natural sleep supplements to help fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.\n\nLife will always have stress. But your perception of it controls your cortisol response.\n\nStart seeing stress as a challenge, not a threat. That simple mental shift changes your biochemistry.\n\nRemind yourself: \u201cThis too will pass.\u201d\n\nFocus on the solution, not the problem.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to do all 7 things at once.\n\nStart with 1\u20132 habits and make them part of your routine.\n\nYour body will respond with more calm, more energy, better hormone balance, and you\u2019ll feel younger, more confident, and in control.\n\nRemember: Don\u2019t just passively read or watch. Take action.\n\nThis is your life. You\u2019re the director, producer, writer, and actor. Own your health and stop beating yourself up. Give yourself credit \u2014 and start today.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort...

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and research continues to confirm that stress can cause hair to gray prematurely by affecting the stem cells that are responsible for regenerating hair pigment.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to know is that your \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, high adrenaline output, and chronic stress, basically kill off these stem cells\u2026\n\nWhich then causes your hair to lose pigment, and thus, white or grey hair comes out instead.\n\nThis is a natural part of aging.\n\nUnfortunately, stress, anger, worry\u2026 or anything that turns on your sympathetic nervous system into high gear, accelerates aging and in today\u2019s topic\n\nLastly, as stress accelerates the greying of hair, it also causes hair loss.\n\nYou can\u2019t change back the color of hair that\u2019s been grey for many years.\n\nBut the research shows that you CAN reverse the graying and even hair loss, for newly affected hairs (less than a year or so).\n\nThe stem cells are still functional\u2026 so we have hope.\n\nThus, the sooner you act, the faster your results and improvement in hair color and density.\n\nSimple And Effective Suggestions\n\nReduce Stress Hormones: There are lots of ways, which I\u2019m going to point out below.

I\u2019ve got videos about better sleep on this site. Plus, you can take herbs that help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.\n\nExercise 3-5x weekly and no longer than an hour a day. Daily walks are also a great idea, 15-30 minutes daily.\n\nIf you are dealing with extra worry, anxiety, and nervousness \u2013 take herbs to help relax and calm your nervous system. You\u2019ll feel better, happier, and far less stressed.\n\nThese are proven and simple changes that\u2019ll cause fast results and improvements in your stress levels, adrenal function, and mood.\n\nYou need to create better, daily habits of managing stress \u2026 not only for vanity reasons such as skin and hair, but also for overall health, fitness, and longevity.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort...

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and we live in a world of extra stress and one of the biggest reasons is our cell phones.\n\nEverything is happening instantly and we are being bombarded with information and people all day long\u2026\n\nAll of which can cause chronically elevated stress hormones such as cortisol.\n\nIt\u2019s never-ending, from morning till night. 24/7!\n\nThis puts your body in a constant state of \u201cfight or flight\u201d.\n\nYour adrenal glands are constantly overproducing stress hormones, which causes negative changes in all your other hormones such as growth hormone, testosterone, thyroid, and so forth, resulting in:\n\nMuscle loss and belly fat gain\n\nBlood pressure problems\n\nPain in your joints and muscles\n\nWrinkles and hair loss\n\nImpaired brain function and poor memory\n\nLowered sex drive and erectile problems for guys\n\nLowered immune function\n\nAnd of course, all of this leads to accelerated aging \u2013 externally and internally.\n\nMy Personal Experience\n\nThis is a super important topic to me, so much so that in the early 90\u2019s I decided to take a prescription drug to lower my cortisol and stress hormones.\n\nThe initial results were awesome.\n\nBut within a couple of weeks, my body adapted and then the opposite would happen.\n\nMy body overproduced cortisol.\n\nSo then I\u2019d increase the dose of the drug. Again, great results for a couple of weeks, but then the opposite.\n\nEventually, I figured out that there is no way to trick the body with drugs because drugs work AGAINST your body.\n\nSo I needed to find natural ways to lower stress and cortisol levels that worked WITH my body and not against it.\n\nThe end result is easy to maintain long-term.\n\nGranted, the results are also slower when compared to the \u201cinstant gratification\u201d of drugs.\n\nSo with that said, today I\u2019m going to quickly reveal the 10 best ways to naturally lower stress and cortisol levels.\n\nI will go into more detail about each of the 10 ways in future articles.\n\nBut today I\u2019ll quickly summarize each one.\n\nBy the way, if you didn\u2019t already know \u2013 my background is in anti-aging endocrinology \u2013 which is the study of hormones.\n\nSo, yes\u2026 I\u2019m more knowledgeable about all of this than most people.\n\nSo if this is a topic you\u2019re interested in and if you have extra stress and want to finally improve your cortisol and stress hormones, then make sure you check my blog regularly for updates.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s get started\u2026\n\nOne of the best ways to lower your cortisol and stress levels is to sleep better.\n\nNot necessarily sleep more, even though many of us are sleep deprived.\n\nIn order to sleep better and optimize your hormones, you want to get to bed when cortisol levels naturally start to decrease, which is around 9 to 10 pm.\n\nBecause around 11 pm, you get that second wind and that\u2019s actually cortisol levels going back up. We don\u2019t want this.\n\nSo, get your body ready for sleep by dimming the lights around your home, turning on your blue blockers, and taking some herbs/supplements and specific sleep hormones before bedtime so you\u2019ll fall asleep faster and you\u2019ll get a much deeper sleep, which will produce optimal hormone levels.\n\nAnd then wake up naturally, with NO alarm clock, when the sun naturally starts to come up\u2026 which is around 6-7 am.\n\nThis keeps cortisol levels balanced and in a healthy range.\n\nAnd yes, I\u2019ll do an entire article series about sleep hacks since this has been one of my personal challenges my entire life.\n\nAfter sleep, the second-best way to improve stress levels is by taking specific supplements that are clinically shown to help lower stress hormones and support healthy cortisol levels.\n\nThe benefit of supplements is that they work immediately, they\u2019re easy and convenient, which is something we all want.\n\nI\u2019ve been using these for years and they really do work.\n\nI\u2019ve tested my hormones multiple times with blood and saliva and there\u2019s always a dramatic improvement.\n\nSome of the best supplements are:\n\nTwo specific forms of ashwagandha extract \u2013 Sensoril and KSM-66\n\nand a few other herbs and specific vitamins and minerals\n\nYou can get more details about these ingredients, how they work, the correct dosages, and the best form for each of them \u2013 so you don\u2019t get ripped off.\n\nI take them after my workouts when my cortisol levels are sky-high and I want to lower them immediately so I can gain muscle and lose fat.\n\nI also take them before bed, to help calm my nervous system and help me sleep.\n\nMost people have high cortisol all day long and the worst time is before bed.\n\n3. Lower Stressful Situations \u2013 External\n\nYou can\u2019t always control your outside world\u2026 but you can help reduce stressful situations externally.\n\nThis means that you need to stop or at least reduce spending time on negative things in life.\n\nLess news and negative media online.\n\nInteract less with negative people \u2013 and we all have such individuals in our lives.\n\nSpending MORE time on positive things, situations, and people.\n\nI know it can be addictive to watch all the negativity \u2026 the media knows this and it sells.\n\nJust be mindful and keep an eye on how much time you\u2019re spending on negative situations that you have no control over.\n\n4. Lower Stressful Situations \u2013 Internally\n\nEven though you can\u2019t control external events that cause stress, you for sure can internally learn to control how you REACT to stress and the MEANING you give to stressful situations and events.\n\nWhen something bad happens in your life \u2013 do you automatically\u2026\n\nDo you play the victim?\n\nDo you keep reliving the negative event over and over again?\n\nAll this does is keep producing negative stress hormones all day long and YOU are at fault.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easier said than done to change your focus and I\u2019ve got some quick ways to do so and I\u2019ll reveal them in my future articles.\n\nFor now, just try to adopt an \u201cattitude of gratitude\u201d.\n\nBelieve it or not, your diet easily controls stress hormones. This includes the type of diet, calories, and foods you eat.\n\nEating only one meal a day for example or extreme intermittent fasting causes an increase in stress hormones. Your body thinks it\u2019s in survival mode.\n\nAlso, blood sugar and insulin help lower cortisol levels and fuel your brain and muscles.\n\nSo, being on a very low-carb or no-carb keto diet or carnivore diet tends to increase your cortisol levels and over time lowers total and free testosterone levels (all are bad).\n\nOn the other hand, eating a diet high in processed foods and high glycemic load carbs that cause blood sugar fluctuations throughout the day also causes highs and lows in your cortisol levels.\n\nExtreme calorie-restricted diets also cause massive amounts of cortisol. You lose weight, but a lot of it can be valuable muscle.\n\nDon\u2019t stress your body, keep it slow and steady.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ll go deeper into this topic in a future article.\n\nYou need to move daily to help balance your stress hormones. Unfortunately, there are many exercises that will increase your stress levels and put additional stress on your nervous system.\n\nGoing balls-to-the-wall at the gym every workout will do this.\n\nRunning and other higher-intensity, long-duration exercises will also do this.\n\nWorking out hard every day without also taking OFF days and days where you\u2019re not going 100% and beyond will also cause chronically elevated levels of cortisol and kill your adrenal glands and decrease good hormones.\n\nThis has been one of my personal issues because I was always \u201call or nothing\u201d at the gym and I was constantly \u201covertrained\u201d and had elevated cortisol levels, which decreased my testosterone.\n\nIt took me years to find the correct balance and I\u2019ll tell you how I\u2019ve done it in a future article.\n\nHowever, start the day off on a positive note and go for a brisk 15-20 min walk outside. Just enjoy nature or listen to something positive.\n\nThis helps set the wheels in a positive motion and helps proper cortisol levels for the night as well.\n\nMost people are dehydrated and that puts stress on your body and increases cortisol levels.\n\nDrinking coffee, soda, juice, protein shakes, energy drinks, and so forth is not how you properly hydrate your body.\n\nIn fact, many of these drinks increase your body\u2019s need for more water.\n\nSo, increase your water intake daily, especially if you exercise regularly. Add some lemon juice into the water if you\u2019d like.\n\nThe only other beverage I suggest is green tea.\n\nDuring the day, you\u2019re going to run into stressful situations. At the very least, a few times a week.\n\nAnd it seems like every 2-3 months, there\u2019s a big explosion in our lives or lots of things start to go wrong at once.\n\nWhen these situations happen, big or small, you need to change your focus.\n\nInstead of focusing on the PROBLEM, you need to focus on the SOLUTION.\n\nMost people spend the majority of their time and brain energy thinking about, speaking about, and focusing on the problem.\n\nThey keep reliving it in their heads.\n\nThey keep bringing it up every time they see someone.\n\nThey basically keep reliving the stressful event over and over again. Which causes your body to keep producing stress hormones the entire time.\n\nInstead, see the problem, bitch and complain about it for a little bit, get it out\u2026 and then focus the rest of your energy on the solution.\n\nBecause what you focus on expands and you\u2019ll get more of.\n\nFocus on the problem, you\u2019ll see and get more.\n\nFocus on the solution, and you\u2019ll get results and move forward.\n\nThis will then produce positive hormones and reduce the negative stress ones.\n\nSometimes it feels like we\u2019re always giving to everyone.\n\nWe\u2019re being pulled in a dozen different directions. Everyone wants a piece of you and your time.\n\nWork, friends, kids, relationships, bills, and so forth.\n\nWell, through all of this, you also need to take time out every day and give time to yourself.\n\nDon\u2019t expect this from anyone else.\n\nIt\u2019s YOUR job. YOUR responsibility.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s going to the gym. That\u2019s my time.\n\nI also get in my massage chair twice daily for 15 min and just relax, meditate, or take a nap and let my brain go blank.\n\nI\u2019m rebooting my system.\n\nYou need to see what makes you happy and set time aside daily.\n\nIf you don\u2019t plan it, it won\u2019t happen because life will get in the way.\n\nAnd don\u2019t give me excuses that you don\u2019t have the time \u2013 stop watching TV or going on social media or having mindless conversations with people.\n\nYou need to reboot your system at least once a day.\n\nAnd finally, take action on what you\u2019ve read today. Most people barely read half of an article let alone implement what they\u2019ve learned.\n\nOne thing that causes us stress is feeling lost, hopeless, confused, and so forth.\n\nWhen you take action, you\u2019re going towards something positive and making progress.\n\nThat will reduce your stress and increase your confidence.\n\nThere are other ways to lower stress, but I\u2019ve found these to be the most effective.\n\nToday I\u2019ve listed the top 10 ways to improve your stress and cortisol levels. Pick one and do it. Then pick another and another.\n\nSmall improvements daily will result in big changes over time.\n\nSome are easier to implement than others \u2026 like taking a 15 min walk in the morning. Anyone can do this and it\u2019s free.\n\nSome work a lot faster than others, such as taking supplements. And again, click on this link about the supplements I use, the benefits, and so forth.\n\nRead this article over and over again so you can improve your stress levels and live a much healthier, happier, and longer life.\n\nAnd stay tuned for more detailed articles about each of these 10 topics in the near future.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort...

Not only does it make food taste better, it\u2019s good FOR you\u2026 IF you use the right kind of salt.\n\nAnd no, it does NOT increase your blood pressure.\n\nSugar is actually a bigger cause of high blood pressure, but I\u2019ll leave that for another article\u2026\n\nRemember\u2026 the planet is made up of mostly saltwater. Your body is made up of saltwater.\n\nWhen you go to the hospital and they put an IV Drip, that\u2019s salt water. In fact, babies prefer the taste of saltwater over regular water.1\n\nImproving Athletic Performance\n\nYears ago when I used to consult and train professional and Olympic athletes, I would give extra salt to those who were feeling anxious, worrying, having panic attacks or just feeling stressed.\n\nWithin seconds, they felt more at ease, calmer, and more confident.\n\nI knew about this \u201csecret\u201d because of my background in Endocrinology \u2013 which is the study of hormones.\n\nSalt Reduces Stress Hormones\n\nSalt helps reduce stress hormones such as Cortisol and angiotensin II.\n\nAdditionally, it increases Oxytocin, an anti-stress hormone, which also acts as a neurotransmitter in your brain. It improves social interaction and is sometimes referred to as the \u201cbonding hormone\u201d.\n\nNow, they\u2019ve also done studies on rats by giving them extra salt during times of stress and the rats became more interactive and less socially anxious.2\n\nAnd researchers at the University of Iowa have stated that salt may actually \u201cact as a natural antidepressant and mood-booster\u201d.3\n\nSo what does this mean for you?\u2026\n\nWell, the next time you feel extra stress, worry, panic, or maybe even depressed, you might consider adding some extra salt to your diet\u2026 especially FIRST thing in the morning!\n\nOnly Use A Specific Type Of Salt\n\nHowever, NOT regular table salt. That\u2019s been processed and refined. It\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nWhat you want to use is unrefined sea (or rock) salt, which contains lots of valuable trace minerals and electrolytes.\n\nThey are also key players in enzyme production as well as the immune system, adrenal, and thyroid function.\n\nTwo of my favorites are Himalayan (pink) sea salt and Celtic (grey) sea salt\n\nA little goes a long way.\n\nUse these and avoid table salt (pure sodium) and pre-packaged foods, which are also loaded with bad salt.\n\nAdditionally, if you are dealing with extra worry, anxiety or even depression \u2026 you can take specific herbs that\u2019ll help improve these \u201cnegative feelings\u201d quickly.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the best supplements\u2026\n\nAnd if you want more information on other natural ingredients that lower stress, worry, and depression \u2014 I have summarized it for you by going HERE.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "Today we are discussing intermittent fasting, a hot topic that\u2019s got everyone talking.\n\nIs it the miracle diet it\u2019s often made out to be? Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nIntermittent Fasting and Weight Loss: What\u2019s Really Going On?\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard that intermittent fasting helps you drop pounds fast.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s not just fat you\u2019re losing; it\u2019s muscle too.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news because it slows down how fast your body burns calories.\n\nSo, what happens when you stop fasting and eat normally again?\n\nYou might just end up gaining more fat.\n\nFeeling Energized? Think Again\n\nPeople say fasting makes you feel more awake and clear-headed.\n\nSure, skipping meals might give you a quick energy boost, thanks to stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline kicking in.\n\nBut having these hormones high all the time? High cortisol means low testosterone \u2013 not great for your body or your health in the long run.\n\nLiving Longer with Fasting? Maybe Not\n\nThere\u2019s talk about fasting making you live longer.\n\nBut the solid proof, especially for us humans, isn\u2019t really there.\n\nMost of those claims come from studies on animals, not people.\n\nMy Advice: Keep It Balanced\n\nI\u2019m all for keeping things balanced.\n\nInstead of skipping meals, focus on staying active and eating right.\n\nExercise, especially a mix of walking and weights, helps keep your muscles strong and your body in good shape.\n\nThis approach is much better for you than the ups and downs of fasting.\n\nBottom Line on Intermittent Fasting\n\nSo, is intermittent fasting the health shortcut it\u2019s often claimed to be?\n\nLosing muscle, messing with your energy levels, and banking on uncertain long-term benefits don\u2019t sound like a winning plan to me.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about fasting to get healthier or lose weight, consider this: good health isn\u2019t a quick fix.\n\nIt\u2019s about making smart choices every day that add up to a healthy, active life.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness/can-trees-really-reduce-your-stress-anxiety-new-study/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and someone asked me the other day if trees can really reduce your stress? He brought this up due to some recent studies.\n\nWell, if you\u2019re in a rush \u2013 the short answer is YES, trees can, in fact, reduce your stress.\n\nThe truth is most things in nature can. Heck, even looking at pictures of nature can help reduce your stress.1 The pictures help your body relax, so just imagine how powerful REAL nature is.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a clinical study specific to trees.2,3\n\nWhat Do Clinical Studies Say..?\n\nThe basics of the study are that researchers took 160 people and stressed them out. Then, using a Virtual Reality headset, had them view 6 minutes of videos showing cityscapes, as well as trees. The more trees they saw, the lower their stress levels.\n\nThere are other studies showing that simply taking a stroll in the park or through woodland areas can have positive effects on people suffering from mood changes.\n\nNow, the question is \u2013 what causes these benefits?\u2026 How does it work in your body?\u2026\n\nVIRTUAL Nature vs. REAL Nature\n\nWell, if you\u2019re just VISUALLY looking at pictures \u2013 let\u2019s say on your computer, magazines, or high-tech methods like virtual reality headsets \u2013 then it\u2019s a hormonal and chemical response, which is mainly being initiated in your brain. You\u2019re less tense, breathing better, relaxing. All these help improve your dopamine, serotonin, and stress levels.\n\nAnd you can even do this or improve all of this by taking specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals \u2013 especially during times of extra stress \u2013 which I\u2019ll let you know about in a minute.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s better is if you do it in REAL nature because when doing it this way, there are physical benefits. Of course, the sun is one of the greatest healers and one that rarely people take advantage of. Due to stupid doctors and dermatologists, people are now deathly afraid of the sun and avoid it by being fully covered up and wearing harmful sunscreens.\n\nIn addition to the sun\u2019s benefits, the positive energy you get from living organisms such as trees, animals, and birds, improves YOUR energy levels. This positively affects your brain and all of this dramatically improves your hormones and chemicals.\n\nMuch more so than just looking at even pictures, which is a great start.\n\nAgain, when it comes to health, nature already has all the solutions and answers, NOT the pharmaceutical companies.\n\nSo what does all this mean? Let me give you doable action items.\n\nWhenever possible, even if it\u2019s just 5-10 minutes, get outside. Look around you and enjoy nature. STOP looking at your cell phone or multitasking or talking on your phone. Just enjoy your freedom and nature.\n\n2. If you can\u2019t do this, then look at pictures of nature. Big trees, beautiful leaves, and so forth.\n\n3. And during times of extra stress due to life\u2019s problems and challenges, or if your personality is more prone to worry, stress, and depression, then take natural herbs, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals that are proven to help relax your body and improve your hormones and chemicals.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to my favorite natural supplement that does all of this and more. Give it a try.\n\nBut remember, nothing is going to be as powerful as nature. It\u2019s free, so get out and appreciate it and have an attitude of gratitude.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4690962/\n\nhttp://eab.sagepub.com/content/48/4/607.abstract\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916514552321\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9344129/Jogging-in-forest-twice-as-good-as-trip-to-gym-for-mental-health.html",

    "content": "\"I Want To Be Happy & Confident\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb Most people don\u2019t know, but what you eat can play a huge role in your mood, your happiness, and how you feel.\n\nCertain foods can increase or decrease feelings of anxiety, worry and even depression & sadness.\n\nAnd this is because foods interact and control your hormones, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals in your body that can cause you to feel more happiness and joy \u2026 or stress, mood changes and depressive feelings.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss the 3 best types of foods that will help make you happier, and improve your mood \u2013 while reducing feelings of stress, worry, and depressive feelings.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that you want to \u201ccombine\u201d these types of foods together and eat them daily because you\u2019ll get a \u201csynergistic\u201d positive effect, which will make big improvements, quickly.\n\nAnd at the end of this article, I\u2019ll also reveal one of my favorite and most effective \u201call-in-one\u201d solutions \u2026\n\nFoods That Reduce Cortisol & Stress\n\nCortisol is your body\u2019s primary \u201cstress\u201d hormone. When this goes up, a lot of your positive hormones go down.\n\nYou get irritated quickly, you have blood sugar highs and lows, and it causes sleep problems and insomnia.\n\nFoods that lower cortisol are citrus foods that contain high amounts of Vitamin C\u2026 such as Papayas, oranges, Kiwi, pineapples and strawberries.\n\nAlso vegetables such as Kale, Brussels Sprouts, Red bell peppers and Broccoli are also high in Vit. C.\n\nAdditionally, omega-3 fatty acids are good at reducing cortisol. Salmon, hemp oil, flax seeds, and walnuts are highest in Omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nLastly, you can take natural herbs & vitamins that help lower stress hormones.\n\nFoods That Increase Dopamine\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter in your brain and it is associated with the \u201cpleasure system\u201d.\n\nThe higher your dopamine levels and the better your dopamine receptor sensitivity is, the happier you are\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re more driven and excited about life. You feel more enjoyment in daily activities.\n\nUnfortunately as you age, dopamine levels decrease, as does your \u201csensitivity\u201d to it.\n\nThis can lead to memory loss and mood changes.\n\nOne thing you want to do to increase dopamine is eat foods high in the amino acid \u2013 L-Tyrosine, which is needed to produce dopamine.\n\nFoods highest in L-Tyrosine are:\n\nAdditionally, eating foods high in Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically the DHA \u2014 helps increase dopamine. As mentioned earlier, fatty fish such as Salmon and also walnuts are the best.\n\nLastly, you can increase dopamine levels by taking specific herbs.\n\nFoods That Increase Serotonin Levels\n\nSerotonin is sometimes called the \u201chappy hormone\u201d, even though it\u2019s not a hormone. It\u2019s a chemical that helps improve your mood and sleep.\n\nIt also reduces hunger and sugar cravings.\n\nHigher serotonin is also linked to living longer.\n\nOne of the main types of foods that increase serotonin is our favorite type of food, which is carbohydrates.\n\nOf course, not all carbs are good for you and the insulin/sugar spikes will actually cause mood fluctuations.\n\nYou want \u201cclean\u201d carbohydrates such as white rice, yams/sweet potatoes and fruit.\n\nYou can also have small amounts of oatmeal and whole grains.\n\nWhole eggs, nuts, and seeds are also good.\n\nEating some Turkey is good because it contains higher amounts of L-Tryptophan, which helps boost serotonin.\n\nAnd once again, Omega 3 fatty acids also help improve serotonin. So make sure you eat some fatty fish such as salmon and sardines, as well as walnuts.\n\nLastly, there are specific herbs that help increase serotonin levels naturally.\n\nRemember, you want to increase your dopamine and serotonin levels, while also reducing your cortisol at the same time.\n\nTHIS is when you get the biggest, long-lasting benefits.\n\nNow under this article, I want you to click the link about an all-in-one solution, that can quickly help \u201cerase\u201d your worry, anxious and depressive feelings.\n\nSo in summary, make sure you get\n\nEat omega-3 fats \u2013 such as fish oils and walnuts\n\nHealthy carbohydrates \u2013 such as white rice, yams/sweet potatoes and fruit.\n\nProtein \u2013 such as salmon, eggs and turkey\n\nLastly, there are specific herbs that help optimize both serotonin and dopamine levels, to help improve your mood, while reducing feelings of worry, anxiety and sadness.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/stress-cortisol/primary-cause-of-grey-hair-hair-loss-new-clinical-studies/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and there have been lots of theories as to what causes grey hair. Of course, genetics is always a big factor.\n\nAnd IF you know you have the genetics for early grey hair as I do, then today\u2019s topic is even more important because there are lifestyle factors that will surely accelerate the greying of your hair and also speed up hair LOSS.\n\nFor example, stress and the increase in cortisol are major factors in hair loss and turning your hair white.\n\nThere\u2019s one other factor, which I\u2019ll reveal below\u2026\n\nNow, before I continue with the primary cause that triggers and accelerates greying of hair based on the newest research worldwide, let me first do a quick introduction to the biological factors that cause greying of hair.\n\nThere are pigment cells called melanocytes in your hair follicles that give your hair its color, called melanin. When you stop producing this melanin, hair begins to turn gray.\n\nMelanin, as you may know, also controls your skin color. More melanin typically means darker skin.\n\nFor simplicity, blondes and redheads have less melanin and thus, lighter skin and hair color.\n\nPeople usually start to see a few grey hairs after the age of 30. Sadly, each decade increases the number of gray hairs by 10-20%\n\nNow, I got my first grey hair in the 6th grade, which means I was about 11 years old.\n\nSo, for a variety of reasons, probably due to genetics, I had \u201cpremature\u201d greying.\n\nWhat Decreases Melanin and Accelerates Grey Hairs\n\nSo now we know how grey hairs happen, but what causes this decrease in melanin?\n\nThere are lots of theories, such as mineral and vitamin deficiencies. Lack of proteins and so forth.\n\nBut, in the real world, this is rarely the case. I\u2019ve seen old homeless people who have a full head of hair and zero grey hair and trust me \u2013 they are very nutrient deficient and lack a healthy diet.\n\nNow, in 2009, researchers discovered that going gray is simply a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in your hair particles, which bleaches your hair from the inside.\n\nUsually, an enzyme called catalase helps break down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. But as you get older, catalase production starts to slow down.\n\nThe end result is hydrogen peroxide starts to accumulate in the body and ends up \u201cbleaching\u201d out the hair pigments and slowly turns your hair, white.\n\nSo, a decade ago I decided to take Catalase enzymes by themselves to help reduce and prevent this from happening. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t see much of a positive effect and I tried high doses of it for over a year.\n\nAnd there\u2019s been no evidence since taking such supplements improves grey hair and the FTC has warned these supplement makers about this.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say taking catalase enzyme is bad and I think this antioxidant has many health and longevity benefits. However, when it comes to reversing grey hair or even preventing it, there\u2019s no evidence to support it.\n\nNow comes the newest research which is backed by clinical studies and even more importantly, empirical REAL WORLD evidence and that\u2019s, STRESS!\n\nRecently, in January 2020, researchers from Harvard University saw a direct correlation between stress and greying of hair due to melanin loss, which I talked about earlier.\n\nSimply stated, when you\u2019re under extra stress, your body produces chemicals called norepinephrine and adrenaline\u2026\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response and this is how it works.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m making it really simple.\n\nAs this happens, your body quickly produces a massive surge of cortisol \u2013 the stress hormone.\n\nOn a side note, CORTISOL is a steroid. But it\u2019s a CATABOLIC steroid. It tears down. You don\u2019t want this.\n\nWhile testosterone is an ANABOLIC steroid, it builds up.\n\nThus, athletes take anabolic steroids to build muscle. They are never taking catabolic steroids such as cortisol.\n\nYet, doctors readily prescribe catabolic cortisol steroids such as prednisone to reduce inflammation which then accelerates both hair LOSS and greying of hair.\n\nNow, going back to the research, they stated that \u201cAfter just a few days, all of the pigment-regenerating stem cells were lost. Once they\u2019re gone, you can\u2019t regenerate pigments anymore. The damage is permanent.\u201d\n\nThis is why managing stress is so important.\n\nA very close family member of mine went through a divorce, he seemed \u201ccool\u201d on the outside, but within a year, he lost a TON of head hair and a lot of it went grey. It was shocking.\n\nA close friend of mine started a very successful business recently and he has this amazing full head of black hair and he\u2019s almost 50, like me.\n\nIn the past 2 years, I have seen at least 30-40 grey hairs. I just mentioned it to him a few weeks ago and he said \u201cI know man, I\u2019m totally stressed out all the time\u201d.\n\nI have dozens of these examples\u2026\n\nNow, myself\u2026 I color my hair or else I\u2019d have a lot of grey hair and I don\u2019t like it.\n\nBefore I colored my hair when I was younger, people would say \u201cWow, you have so much grey\u2026 what are you stressed about?\u201d\n\nRemember, genetics is a big factor.\n\nHowever, I can\u2019t deny that I tend to push myself. School, work, exercise and on top of it, I\u2019m not a good sleeper.\n\nThe Solution I Discovered\n\nAnd this is why I started taking Stress & Cortisol Relief 10+ years ago. Since then, my progression of grey hairs has for sure decreased tremendously.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t stopped, but it\u2019s slowing down a lot.\n\nSo, I know it works. But, it\u2019s a slow process.\n\nSecondly, taking Inflame & Pain Relief is also super important because it helps manage and decrease inflammation, which is directly linked to hair loss and greying of hair.\n\nLastly, I\u2019ve increased my Vitamin C intake to a minimum of 3-5 grams daily. That\u2019s 5000 mg.\n\nI eat a lot of meals, so I take 1000 mg with each meal. I take more after my workouts and before bed.\n\nWhy?\u2026 Because Vitamin C helps reduce cortisol, improves collagen formation, and is a potent antioxidant \u2014 all of which are needed for healthy-looking hair.\n\nSo the #1 supplement would be Stress & Cortisol Relief and #2 would be Inflame & Pain Relief.\n\nOf course, Vitamin C is a must and it\u2019s inexpensive that everyone should be taking at 1-3 grams daily. So, take 1000 mg, 2-3x daily with meals. Spread it out.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s MUCH EASIER to maintain than to gain.\n\nSo, it\u2019s much easier to keep your hair and the color, than to grow it back and slow down or even potentially reverse the grey.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with stress!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve \"healthy stress hormone levels\" with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/05/ftc-challenges-marketers-baseless-claims-their-supplements\n\nhttps://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-stress-causes-gray-hair\n\nhttps://hsci.harvard.edu/people/ya-chieh-hsu-phd\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673399/",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and studies show that MOST of us (over 75% of people) are all dealing with a LOT more anxiety and similar feelings (overwhelmed, sadness, alone/lonely, etc.).\n\nI recently did an article entitled, What Type Of Anxiety Do You Have & How To Fix It. I got a lot of great feedback and comments.\n\nHowever, a common question I received was, \u201chow do I know if I really have anxiety?\u201d\n\nWhich is an excellent question and I probably should have started with this article first to see IF you have some form of anxiety or not.\n\nAnd to get a rough idea, I\u2019ll be asking you 5 simple, \u201cyes or no\u201d questions, that you can do in a minute, which can help give you more insight on whether you may be dealing with some form of anxiety at the moment.\n\nQuick Stats About Anxiety\n\nSome important stats about anxiety\u2026\n\nStatistically speaking, over 75% of the population has felt some form of anxiety.\n\nGlobally, 1 in 13 people suffers from anxiety on a regular basis.\n\nIn the US, anxiety disorders are the most common form of mental illness, affecting over 40 million adults over the age of 18. That\u2019s about 20% of the population.\n\nAnxiety disorders also affect over 25% of teenagers (children between 13 and 18 years old).\n\nWomen have almost double the risk of developing an anxiety disorder.\n\nAnxiety and depression are also closely related. A high percentage of people with anxiety, also suffer from bouts of depression.\n\nAnd I mention these statistics because if you\u2019re dealing with some form of anxiety, please don\u2019t feel bad. You\u2019re not alone.\n\nPlease don\u2019t feel ashamed or hopeless.\n\nI want you to know that there are various solutions that can help.\n\nThere are natural ways to give you quick relief. So, you don\u2019t have to take harmful, addictive medications.\n\nDifferent Forms Of Anxiety Disorders\n\nAnd there are many different forms of anxiety or \u201canxiety disorders\u201d, such as\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\n\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (SAD)\n\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n\nAgain, these are discussed in more detail in my previous article.\n\nOkay, so let\u2019s get started with the simple quiz. It\u2019s 5, \u201cyes or no\u201d questions.\n\nI\u2019ll ask the questions and just remember or make a note of how many times you said \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nDo you avoid certain people or situations, especially public places or unfamiliar people?\n\nDo you consider yourself a \u201cworrier\u201d? Do you worry daily or often, especially about things that you have no control over? Especially about past events or your future?\n\nDo you often feel like you\u2019re \u201cstressed out\u201d or \u201con edge\u201d? Are you short tempered and less tolerant? Does your heart race or have heart palpitations?\n\nDo you become tired or fatigued quickly: physically or mentally or both? Do your muscles feel tight or tense?\n\nDo you have problems concentrating and focusing?\n\nIf you never said yes, then you probably have no anxiety.\n\nIf you said \u201cyes\u201d, 1 or 2 times, then you may simply be dealing with extra stress at the moment.\n\nMaybe something has recently happened that has caused you to worry more than usual.\n\nThis is fine and it\u2019s normal.\n\nI\u2019ve realized that about every 3-4 months, something blows up in my life that causes me some extra stress and worry. But, it\u2019s always temporary.\n\nStress is a part of life.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s HOW you deal with it and the MEANING you give to a \u201cchallenging\u201d situation, that dictates the outcome and how you feel.\n\nYour goal should be to focus 90% of your energy on the solution and 10% on the problem, simply so you LEARN and grow from it, so it doesn\u2019t happen in the future.\n\nHowever, if you said \u201cyes\u201d, 3 or more times, then you may be suffering from some sort of social anxiety disorder.\n\nYou may also be feeling kinda \u201cblah\u201d or maybe even depressed at times.\n\nIf this is you, then that\u2019s fine too.\n\nIt does NOT mean that you are always going to have anxiety and this is just and how the rest of your life is going to be.\n\nPlease do NOT \u201clabel\u201d yourself as an \u201canxious\u201d person or some other disempowering label.\n\nThere are many reasons for having anxiety.\n\nThe bottom line will always be some sort of chemical or hormonal imbalance.\n\nHowever, the CAUSE of imbalances is what\u2019s important.\n\nIs it your environment,\n\nnutrient deficiencies\n\nChange in your hormones due to aging\n\nLack of communication\n\nStress which causes an increase in stress hormones and hormonal imbalances\n\nDrugs \u2026 which can be prescription, or street drugs, or even over-the-counter stuff?\n\nOr, maybe it\u2019s just what you\u2019re focusing on.\n\nMany times, anxiety stems from fear.\n\nSome people have said that FEAR stands for False Evidence Appearing Real\n\nMany times, what we fear in our minds, is not real. However, whatever the mind truly believes, it will believe it to be REAL.\n\nSo, changing your focus from worry and fear to gratitude and appreciation will cause positive changes in your hormones and brain chemicals, causing happiness and confidence.\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t easy at first.\n\nYou need to UNDO negative habits, which focuses more on the problem, than the solution.\n\nAnd just like a muscle, it needs practice to get stronger and better.\n\nAnyway, the point is that there\u2019s hope and you\u2019re not alone!\n\nI have two helpful links that I want you to visit.\n\nThe first one is to a proven solution that has helped thousands of people for almost 20 years, which can help quickly reduce these \u201cnegative\u201d feelings or emotions.\n\nThe second link is to my previous article, \u201cWhat Type Of Anxiety Do You Have & How To Fix It\u201d.\n\nI urge you to visit one or both of the links right now, while it\u2019s fresh on your mind and start enjoying more of your life.

    "content": "For over 25 years, I\u2019ve been heavily focused on the body and how to optimize it for performance, and longevity and maximize our potential.\n\nHowever, about 15 years ago I started to really focus a lot more on not just the body, but the MIND.\n\nI realized just how the two are so interconnected and that they can\u2019t be separated. Almost like Siamese twins.\n\nNow, as some of you may know \u2013 one of my areas of expertise is endocrinology, which is the study of hormones.\n\nI firmly believe that the way we look and feel is very much dictated by all of our hormones \u2013 including enzymes, neurotransmitters, and all the various other \u201cstuff\u201d that dictate what happens to our hormones and thus, turn some of our genes \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d.\n\nAnd I mention this because of today\u2019s topic \u2013 anxiety.\n\nMost people think anxiety is a \u201cgenetic\u201d thing, but it\u2019s NOT!\n\nIt\u2019s caused by hormonal & chemical imbalances.\n\nAnxiety can be caused by what you THINK about and thus, what you focus on.\n\nAnd it can also be triggered by what you FEEL and thus, what you do with your body.\n\nAnd I\u2019m here to tell you that almost 99% of all anxiety is literally caused by what you DO, THINK or FEEL because it all affects your hormones,\u2026 enzymes, neurotransmitters, and so forth.\n\nSo let me give you 3 clinically proven ways to fix all of this to help erase your anxiety.\n\nIn life, what you focus on, you\u2019ll get more of.\n\nSo if you focus on the bad \u2026 on pain from your past,\u2026 worry about your future,\u2026 or about what you don\u2019t have, \u2026 or all the \u201cshoulds\u201d in your life \u2013 you\u2019ll negatively change your hormones due to stress and you\u2019ll quickly have panic and anxiety.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t normal by the way\u2026 This is a LEARNED behavior.\n\nSo it\u2019s probably not your fault that you \u201cstress\u201d or have \u201canxiety\u201d more than you\u2019d like.\n\nIt\u2019s something you picked up from one of your parents or other people close to you when you were growing up.\n\nNow, in order to help fix this and improve your hormones \u2013 you need to spend 90% of your time focusing on the SOLUTION and only 10% on the \u201cproblem\u201d.\n\nIf you want to bitch and complain,\u2026 get angry and blame the whole world for something bad that\u2019s happened to you \u2014 go ahead. Get it out.\n\nBut only spend 5-10% of your energy on this \u201cproblem\u201d and instead, focus the rest of your time on how to \u201cfix\u201d the situation.\n\nUnfortunately, most people do the opposite and keep complaining every day, to every person they can \u2026 and all this does is keep increasing your stress hormones and the anxiety never leaves.\n\nBy focusing on the solution\u2026 and more importantly, by having an \u201cattitude of gratitude\u201d, your stress hormones will all come back down and immediately, you\u2019ll feel more in control, you\u2019ll have less worry and all of this leads to less anxiety.\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t going to be easy at first.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/stress-cortisol/1-food-for-lowering-stress-cortisol-its-yummy/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today I\u2019m going to quickly discuss the best food to eat, to lower stress levels\u2026\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a yummy food that we all like.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know, cortisol is a stress hormone. High levels of it are linked to numerous health problems, such as:\n\nPoor blood sugar and insulin sensitivity\n\nNegative hormonal changes, such as lowering of testosterone and other \u201csex\u201d hormones.\n\nNegative feelings and moods \u2013 such as anger, frustration, being short-fused, tired, moody, sad, hopeless, and just not feeling happy or excited about life or much of anything\n\nPoor sleep \u2013 which is then linked to all sorts of negative health problems\n\nMuscle loss and fat gain, especially belly fat\n\nIronically though, you NEED cortisol to live.\n\nSo, the goal is NOT to have zero or even \u201clow\u201d cortisol levels\u2026 The real problem is chronically elevated cortisol levels\u2026 Sadly, most of us have due to modern society.\n\n#1 Food For Lowering Cortisol\n\nOkay, so here it goes \u2013 it\u2019s carbohydrates! Yup, carbs are great at lowering cortisol.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve seen this over and over again with people on low-carb diets or keto diets or carnivore diets.\n\nOr people who fast, including intermittent fasting. They tend to have elevated cortisol levels.\n\nThey do say \u201cI have more energy\u201d and one reason is because of higher adrenal production and thus, higher cortisol levels.\n\nCortisol is called the stress hormone, and one reason for this is because of the \u201cfight or flight\u201d mechanism.\n\nCortisol gets you READY for \u201cbattle\u201d or \u201cstressful situations\u201d. It helps make you more capable of facing any potentially stressful or threatening situation.\n\nIn the old days, this may have been some animal attacking you for example.\n\nBut these days, it\u2019s just modern life that\u2019s causing chronic stress. Too much, too often, too long.\n\nAgain, elevated cortisol is good when you need it, in small amounts, in specific, short-term situations\u2026 but not all day long.\n\nCortisol And Blood Sugar Levels\n\nOne of the functions of cortisol is to maintain stable blood sugar levels.\n\nWhen your blood sugar drops\u2026 such as low carb diets, dieting, or similar situations\u2026 cortisol gets released to help increase your blood sugar back up to a normal range \u2013 regardless of eating anything or what you eat.\n\nBlood sugar drops and if you don\u2019t eat something to increase it again, your body will release cortisol to increase it internally.\n\nThis is why being on any type of low-carb diet, tends to cause higher cortisol levels for most people.\n\nAnd, if you are already living a stressful life\u2026 or are dealing with extra stress\u2026 or you have the type of personality that gets stressed or anxious more quickly than someone else, then you should consider eating more carbs.\n\nOf course, a super high carb diet isn\u2019t good either, especially if it\u2019s simple, fast-digesting carbs.\n\nThis is because blood sugar goes up quickly and then drops quickly. This will then cause an increase in cortisol levels again to raise your blood sugar levels back up to normal levels.\n\nSo, What Is The Answer?\n\nWhat has worked for myself and my clients over the past decade is to go ahead and eat carbs.\n\nAnd more precisely, have carbs at specific times of the day, based on your goals and stress levels.\n\nFor example, if you exercise \u2026 you\u2019ll have elevated cortisol levels after your workout. Which is normal. It gives you energy.\n\nHowever, AFTER the workout we want to lower the cortisol. So, eating carbs after you exercise is an ideal time.\n\nOr at the end of the day, when you want to calm your body down and get ready for bed slowly\u2026 This is a great time to have carbohydrates.\n\nIt\u2019ll help lower your cortisol, increase serotonin and allow melatonin, your sleep hormone, to get released.\n\nOne thing to know is that if you have high cortisol, you\u2019ll have low melatonin levels, and thus, why so many of us have a hard time sleeping.\n\nSo, the two best times to eat carbs are after exercise and at the end of the day.\n\nOf course, you can go ahead and still eat carbs the rest of the day, but have lower amounts \u2026\n\nFor example, in the morning or before exercise. Have carbs, but less.\n\nAnd this does NOT mean sugary cereal, donuts, juice, or similar simple carbs that\u2019ll shoot up your blood sugar.\n\nWhat Type Of Carbs Is The Best?\n\nStick to complex carbs, lower glycemic or load carbs \u2013 such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, yams, and whole grains.\n\nNo juices or junky processed carbs.\n\nRemember, we don\u2019t want highs or lows \u2013 we want steady, normal, healthy levels of cortisol and blood sugar.\n\nSo, allow me to quickly summarize what we\u2019ve learned today about lowering cortisol levels utilizing food:\n\nOne big reason low-carb diets (keto, carnivore, etc.) give you energy is because they tend to increase cortisol & stress hormones. We do NOT want chronically elevated stress hormones, it\u2019s bad for your health.\n\nThe best FOOD for lowering cortisol levels & stress hormones is carbohydrates.\n\nIdeal TYPE of carbs to eat are complex (fruits, vegetables, legumes, yams & whole grains). NOT juices or sugars.\n\nThe best TIMES to have carbs are after a workout and before bed or later in the day, to help lower high cortisol and help your body relax.\n\nBecause we live in stressful times, most people should consider taking vitamins & herbs to help lower cortisol & stress hormones.\n\nThe above helps balance both cortisol and blood sugar levels to healthy levels \u2013 not high or low.\n\nGive this a try, especially during times of extra stress or if you\u2019re not sleeping well, and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with stress!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve \"healthy stress hormone levels\" with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "The world of medical science is an interesting one because in many cases a drug that was found to be effective for treating one type of condition may also have positive benefits for treating another condition that has seemingly little relation.\n\nThat is certainly the case with gravol, a medicine that has been around for a period of time which is now being used to treat patients for anxiety. There were arguably few who thought gravol would be used in such a manner when it was first created, but today there are more people who believe that gravol makes for a very effective treatment of those who suffer from increased stress and anxiety levels.\n\nGravol is actually an antihistamine that is primarily used to treat motion sickness. Gravol offers relief from dizziness, nausea and vomiting which are caused when the body and the senses are out of sync because of being in motion. In addition, gravol has also been found effective for relieving congestion of the ears.\n\nThe overall purpose of gravol was to help the body cope with the effects of motion sickness by calming the reaction of the nerves. In essence, motion sickness is caused by the confrontation of the different senses in the body. Basically, if you are below decks on a ship, your body will feel the motion of the boat while the eyes only see a steady, non-moving compartment. This confrontation leads to motion sickness which gravol treats.\n\nHow Gravol Fights Anxiety\n\nHowever, it was discovered by those who suffered from anxiety who took gravol to relieve their motion sickness that they felt calmer and slept better. The ingredients used in gravol have a mild sedating effect on the body which calms the nerves and thus reduces the feelings of anxiety. Interestingly enough, gravol contains theophylline which is actually a stimulant used to counteract the effects of drowsiness, but it is only present in mild amounts which means that the calming effect remain mild and does not interfere with normal, daily activity.\n\nBecause gravol has a mild, overall effect, it can be taken regularly to help people cope with their anxiety until other methods help it to pass from the body. In addition, the medication in gravol helps treat some of the symptoms of anxiety such as nausea. This helps to calm the mind and the body so that it can focus away from the effects which otherwise might build if left unchecked.\n\nGravol can also help people relax and go to sleep faster than without using medication. Again, this is part of its calming effect for use with motion sickness that translates to treating anxiety. For many, gravol offers answers that other anxiety medications do not fully address.\n\nHowever, gravol also has side effects as well, most notably a mild form of drowsiness that may impair your concentration during the day. Such mild side effects aside, gravol does an excellent job of treating anxiety in certain people to help them live more normal lives.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "For those that struggle with the effects of anxiety in their lives along with the regular stresses of everyday life, there are natural substances that can be consumed which promote better overall health and a means in dealing with these issues.\n\nOne of the more celebrated natural products is L-Theanine which has helped many thousands of people deal with the daily stresses of social anxiety by bringing a calmness and more peaceful state to their mind.\n\nL-Theanine is an amino acid that is designed to help bring about a better sense of well being to the mind and body. It\u2019s primary purpose is to assist the body during times of stress and anxiety. Because L-Theanine is a natural amino acid used in the body, it has no side effects when taken in recommended doses and works to improve the mind and body naturally when used on a regular basis.\n\nHow Does L-Theanine Work?\n\nThe L-Theanine has the ability to affect the brain in a very positive way by helping it to restore the natural balance which constitutes the normal emotional state. Anxiety disrupts this balance and leaves the brain in need of various minerals and substances such as L-Theanine in order for it to become balanced once again.\n\nL-Theanine promotes the production of serotonin and dopamine in the body which in turn promotes a feeling of well being and relaxation. This helps the mind and body cope with the anxiety by activating the production of two neurotransmitters that counter the effects. In addition, this substance promotes the production of GABA, a chemical that helps prevent your brain from firing too many neurons at the same time which in turns helps you to calm down.\n\nFinally, the production of Alpha Waves in the brain is increased as well which creates a feeling of relaxation and better focus. For those are concerned about all the effects that L-Theanine produces, it is a non-addictive, all natural substance that your body uses on a daily basis. Adding L-Theanine actually restores the natural balance to your brain until your anxiety is quelled.\n\nDoes L-Theanine Cure Anxiety Attacks?\n\nNo, this substance is not a cure, but it is a product that can counteract the effects of an anxiety attack until it passes. First and foremost, you should consult with your doctor to ensure that your anxiety is being caused by conditions that L-Theanine can treat. An examination by your doctor can determine the real causes of your anxiety attacks and L-Theanine just might be prescribed or recommended.\n\nFortunately, L-Theanine is relatively inexpensive, carries no known harmful side effects when taken in recommended doses and can bring about a more relaxed state that helps you focus when suffering from an anxiety attack. L-Theanine is non-habit forming and there is no withdrawal once this substance is no longer being taken. For those who have suffered from anxiety attacks, L-Theanine is arguably one treatment that offers relief without any downsides to its use which makes it perfect for treating social anxiety.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

After all, a proper diagnosis will separate whether you are actually suffering from the symptoms of adrenal fatigue or something else that may be harmless and temporary or more sinister and in need of immediate treatment.\n\nHowever, there are simple tests that can be performed quickly to see if you do indeed have adrenal fatigue. One of the more popular is saliva testing which can be done relatively quickly and with some degree of accuracy.\n\nWhat is Saliva Testing?\n\nThe adrenal glands in your body respond to the stresses that you endure. Their activity is represented by the amount of adrenal hormone known as cortisol that is present in your blood and other bodily fluids such as your saliva. How much cortisol is in your saliva is an indication of the activity of your adrenal glands. A standard DHEAS saliva test will measure the amount of stress hormones as well as cortisol in your saliva. The results will be evaluated to determine if indeed you may be suffering from adrenal fatigue.\n\nThe test itself is performed four times in a single day simply by spitting into a test tube. Generally speaking, the test happens in the morning, noon, early evening and late at night to get an accurate representation of a complete day and the level of stress hormones and cortisol in the body. Once completed, you simply send the test tubes back to the lab for analysis. In about 2 weeks time, the testing will be complete and you and your doctor can evaluate the results.\n\nAre Saliva Tests Reliable?\n\nSaliva tests are generally very good indicators of the levels of all the stress hormones in your body and saliva cortisol is actually covered by Plan B Medicare as well. The National Institute of Health and the World Health Organization recognizes saliva tests as being quite accurate. Plus, many insurance plans outside of Medicare cover this type of testing as well.\n\nSaliva testing is often done by independent labs that do a wide variety of testing for doctors around the world. The advantage of the saliva test is that no refrigeration or special instructions are needed for the preservation of the saliva once it has been sealed in the test tubes. They are simply mailed to the lab for testing under normal conditions.\n\nHowever, saliva tests are not the end-all, be-all when it comes to your physical condition. This is especially true if you have not suffered from a long-term event that would have caused the adrenal fatigue in the first place.\n\nRemember that saliva testing should be considered the first step and not the final indication that you are indeed suffering from adrenal fatigue. While adrenal fatigue is relatively benign, the symptoms and the saliva test may cover you to a more serious condition that may be developing in your body. You should always double check the results with another test performed by a physician that will also scan for indications of anything that is more serious developing in your body.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!\n\nThere are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents.\n\nBecause of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.\n\nIf this is something you're also interested in, you can easily copy my \"proven formula\", implement it and start seeing and feeling results within minutes...",

    "content": "Anxiety is one of the most pervasive of medical conditions in the United States with over 25 million people suffering from its effects at some point and time. There are many different forms of anxiety which affects Americans that range from those which can impact your daily life to causing harm to your overall health.\n\nOne of the more popular treatments for anxiety is Picamilon which has been used for years in helping to control moments of anxiety.\n\nPatients who suffer from anxiety often find it necessary to increase the GABA levels in the brain in order to make up for the deficit that exists. Picamilon is a modified GABA compound that is widely known to target the brain and help reduced the feelings caused by anxiety. Because this is a specific compound that is needed, Picamilon is considered by the medical profession to be safe and quite effective in terms of treating anxiety in many different cases.\n\nPicamilon is created from Niacin or Vitamin B3 as well as being a derivative of GABA which help increases GABA levels in the brain to offset the effects of anxiety. Picamilon is not considered a cure for anxiety, but rather a temporary supplement that helps people overcome an anxiety attack and place them in a relaxed, almost \u201cfeel-good\u201d state of mind without becoming drowsy as many other types of medications would do.\n\nIn addition to anxiety, picamilon has also been used to treat depression, dementia, ADHD, migraines, asthenia and many other form of mental impairment with varying degrees of success. Picamilon is also quite common and very inexpensive as well.\n\nDoes Picamilon Really Work?\n\nIt does work in the temporary sense in that it will relieve the current conditions of anxiety as suffered by many people, but it is not a cure or permanent fix. Instead, it can be best described as a supplemental solution that fills in a very important need in the brain that is non-narcotic and can be used safely and without side effects.\n\nThe feeling itself of using picamilon is that of having a good or positive \u201cbuzz\u201d, but it is not one that hooks those that use the product. Instead, it is a feeling of relief that also provides energy as well which is unlike so many other anxiety treatments. However, it must be noted that there are side effects to using this product, but they are very mild in nature and some, such as the lowering of blood pressure, is actually beneficial.\n\nDespite this, a visit to the doctor is recommended as picamilon is not for everyone as it may not treat all forms of anxiety. However, a doctor\u2019s visit can provide valuable information that may lead to this compound to be recommended.\n\nPicamilon may not be the right anxiety treatment for everyone\u2019s needs, but for those who can benefit it does provide temporary relief that is safe, effective and provides an energetic feeling so that a person can continue on with their day with little in the way of interruption.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue-se/using-pregnenolone-for-adrenal-fatigue/",
    "content": "The mother of all steroid hormones, pregnenolone actually has a long history with researchers who have studied this hormone for its many different effects that range from the regulation of sodium to the synthesis of the female hormone in the body. Many researchers have called pregnenolone a \u201cpro-hormone\u201d for good reason.\n\nHowever, its use as part of a stress relief program was also carefully studied all the way back to World War II when researchers found that it not only reduced stress, but that it also increased energy levels for those who were fatigued. However, the research on pregnenolone as stress relief was virtually halted when cortisol, another hormone, was found to be far superior in some respects. This was especially true in those who have rheumatoid arthritis as it relieved inflammatory joints and provided significant short-term improvements.\n\nThe Rise of Pregnenolone for Adrenal Fatigue\n\nAlthough research slowed on pregnenolone, it didn\u2019t stop and today there is still plenty of ongoing study that has demonstrated the many positive and some negative effects it has on the body, particularly in those who suffer from adrenal fatigue.\n\nPregnenolone is essentially a stimulant to the body and brain which results in greater energy levels, improved memory, better focus and even a happier mood. This sense of well being generally translates into other benefits as well that includes everything from improving the immune defenses of the body to better skin health and even certain anti-aging properties as well.\n\nThe effects on adrenal fatigue however are certainly mixed. While the lowering of stress levels and energy boost helps those who suffer from this condition feel better and more energized. Once the effects of the pregnenolone wear off the body and mind are likely to crash to a greater degree that people who do not suffer from adrenal fatigue.\n\nThere have been a number of studies over this particular effect and the result has generally been that once the effects of the hormone have run their course, the body is now starved for a source of new energy and the body and mind sink down to levels below that from which they started before the pregnenolone was introduced.\n\nAnother danger is that it\u2019s possible over time to actually overdose on pregnenolone due to the fact that the body becomes \u201cused\u201d to the amount that is artificially taken which results in having to take more which can then cause an overdose reaction.\n\nDespite being a natural hormone in the body, there are side effects present such as the following.\n\nAnxious or Unreasonable Anger\n\nHeadaches & Hair Loss\n\nThese side effects are usually more than enough to keep pregnenolone from being prescribed in large doses to people suffering from adrenal fatigue. However, when taken in low amount for a short period of time, pregnenolone can provide a fair amount of stress relief without the stimulating effects overwhelming the body. However, care should be taken with the doctor kept fully informed when the effects of this hormone go too far. A Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019ve had a bunch of people ask me about Ketogenic diets and low-carb diets and how they affect your hormone levels. More specifically:\n\nMetabolism and thyroid hormones\n\nCortisol and stress hormones\n\nAnd today I\u2019m going to cover cortisol and stress hormones.\n\nIn future articles, I\u2019ll be speaking about each of the other hormones \u2014 testosterone, growth, and thyroid.\n\nAnd this is very important for anyone who wants to lose weight since this is a major reason people go on low-carb and keto diets.\n\nBut more importantly, if you\u2019re:\n\nan athlete and exercise\n\nWeight lifter and want to maximize muscle growth and strength\n\nAnd even more specifically, older people and women \u2013 since keto and low-carb diets affect them even more\n\nWhat Is A Ketogenic Diet?\n\nJust a reminder, a keto or ketogenic diet is when the majority of the foods and calories you eat, come from FAT.\n\nIt\u2019s technically very low in protein and almost no carbohydrates.\n\nMany people think that a keto diet just means little or no carbs and you can eat as much protein as possible.\n\nFor example, have a big steak and fry it up in butter.\n\nBut this is false because protein converts to glucose through \u201cgluconeogenesis\u201d.\n\nThus, the more protein you eat, the harder it is to get into ketosis. It\u2019s like you\u2019re still eating carbs because of the higher protein intake.\n\nThis is why a true keto diet is really hard to follow and a bit disgusting because it\u2019s almost all fat.\n\nFor marketing reasons, people tried to make a keto diet more palatable and tasty by adding lots of protein.\n\nBut later they discovered that it was really hard to get into ketosis because the protein was basically converted to glucose and sugar through gluconeogenesis.\n\nKetogenic Diet & Cortisol Levels\n\nSo, in regards to keto and very low-carb diets and how it affects your cortisol levels\u2026\n\nSimply stated, keto diets have been shown to increase stress hormones, such as cortisol.\n\nEven more so, for people who exercise regularly \u2013 cardiovascular and especially weight lifting \u2013 a keto and even a very low-carb diet has been shown to increase cortisol levels, while simultaneously lowering testosterone levels.\n\nRemember, cortisol opposes testosterone.\n\nAs cortisol goes up, testosterone comes down.\n\nThis means a decrease in muscle, strength, and stamina, while an increase in body fat over time.\n\nObviously, this is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAnd this is even more pronounced and negative in older men and women because they don\u2019t have much testosterone to protect themselves during times of stress and higher cortisol levels.\n\nAs a side note: at the end of this article, I\u2019ve listed 2 great ways to lower cortisol levels \u2013 naturally.\n\nJust make sure you take a look when you finish reading this article to the end.\n\nWhy Cortisol Goes Up On Keto Diets?\n\nThere are lots of reasons why cortisol goes up when carbs are very low.\n\nOne primary reason is your body is trying to increase energy levels since there\u2019s a lack of glucose.\n\nJust remember, in some ways, a ketogenic diet mimics starvation, which is stressful.\n\nAfter a few days or weeks of a keto diet, your body goes into a metabolic state called ketosis, again \u2013 stressful.\n\nYour body will then use an alternative fuel source called Ketones to survive since no glucose is available.\n\nKetones for brain energy and fuel might be fine and even preferred by some people, temporarily.\n\nBut not long-term for many months and years.\n\nAnd definitely NOT for muscle and anyone who exercises!\n\nAnd before you start to debate me on this \u2013 there are some people who do well on keto diets and can stay healthy long-term.\n\nHowever, these are more of the exceptions than the rule. For most of us regular people, long-term keto diets will have negative effects.\n\nSo, What\u2019s The Solution?\n\nSo you may be thinking, what\u2019s the solution?\u2026 What are your options?\u2026\n\nI think a keto diet can be helpful for people who have epilepsy and seizures.\n\nFor people who have neurological disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nFor very sedentary people who are very overweight and you can slowly cycle into a keto diet and then cycle off it, back and forth throughout the year.\n\nBut if you have a stressful lifestyle\u2026 emotionally and/or physically\u2026\n\nIf you exercise, then you may reconsider keto or very low-carb diets\u2026.\n\nOr just make sure you cycle it. Maybe 2 months on, 2-4 weeks off.\n\nAnd if you do, make sure you manage your cortisol levels by taking specific supplements.\n\nTwo of the best would be Stress & Cortisol Relief and also Vitamin C.\n\nI take at least 1000 mgs of Vitamin C, 3x daily.\n\nI also suggest taking Stress & Cortisol Relief after exercise and before bed to minimize excess stress & cortisol levels.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with stress!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today I\u2019m going to talk about anxiety, how it affects women vs men, the potential causes, and some solutions to help you or anyone you know who has feelings of anxiety.\n\nAnd yes, I\u2019m one of those people that deal with anxiety for many years and it\u2019s probably one reason I rarely do face videos.\n\nIt\u2019s been estimated that about a third of adults, that\u2019s about 33% of people, experience anxiety disorders at various times in their lives.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s the most common class of \u201cmental disorders\u201d \u2013 which I personally think is a horrible label because it\u2019s not a mental disorder.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that YOUNGER people, especially teenagers feel even more anxiety.\n\nWhat\u2019s super interesting is that women feel anxiety at twice the rate of men, that\u2019s 2x more.\n\nSo, why do so many people feel so much anxiety?\n\nWhy does it affect teenagers even more?\n\nLastly, why do women feel more anxiety than men?\n\nBefore I start, is the cause nature or nurture? Do you think it\u2019s mostly genetics or how you were raised?\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s The Cause Of Anxiety?\n\nWell, the truth is that about 50% is genetics.\n\nSome people just have more anxiety than others and you\u2019ll hear parents saying that about their children at an early age.\n\nSo yes, genetics plays a big role in anxiety\u2026 In fact, genetics plays a big role in everything.\n\nHowever, your life experiences also play the other 50%.\n\nNow, if you have the genetics to have more anxiety than someone else \u2026 AND you\u2019ve had a lot of trauma in your life\u2026 AND if you\u2019re a woman\u2026\n\nWell, then you\u2019ve got higher odds of having more anxiety.\n\nBut you know, who cares?\n\nJust because of your genetics or life, does NOT mean that you have to label yourself as an anxious person.\n\nBy the way, there is a very fine line between anxiety and excitement \u2013 they both feel the same.\n\nYou see, anxiety tends to happen because of what you focus on in the future.\n\nDepression can be linked to what you focused on in the past.\n\nYes, I\u2019m making generalities\u2026 but you get the point.\n\nPeople who have feelings of anxiety usually start to think about \u201cwhat if something bad happens\u201d and thus, a negative future outcome.\n\nSo, negative \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u2026\u201d about the future will cause you to see a negative outcome and all of this will cause negative changes in your hormones, neurotransmitters, heart rate, blood pressure and so forth \u2013 all causing and increasing feelings of anxiety.\n\nThus, what you focus on expands. This is a very important concept to remember.\n\nWhy Do Teenagers or Women Have More Anxiety?\n\nWell, one reason for this is due to hormones and more specifically, hormonal fluctuations.\n\nYes, the kind you have when going through puberty.\n\nAnd yes, what women go through each month because of their menstrual cycles.\n\nBy the way, guys with low testosterone have more anxiety than guys with high testosterone.\n\nSo yes, hormones play a big role and that\u2019s because hormones also affect important neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine.\n\nSIDE NOTE: There are natural solutions to optimizer these neurotransmitters.\n\nNow coming back to what I had said earlier regarding men vs women.\n\nWomen tend to cry more when they are dealing with anxiety. They also express and verbalize their emotions to their girlfriends or a therapist.\n\nMen tend to get angry to let out their anxiety \u2013 bottling it up, instead of speaking about it. Their anxiety builds, especially if a man doesn\u2019t express emotions, and it can lead to explosive anger.\n\nWhat Else Plays A Major Role In Anxiety?\u2026\n\nEating junk food, processed foods, and lots of sugars and carbohydrates can all cause negative hormonal changes and thus, cause anxiety.\n\nIn fact, one of the best diets for people who have extreme anxiety or even depression is a true ketogenic diet or a lower-carb diet.\n\nAgain, a change in hormones due to insulin, ketones, cortisol, adrenalin, and so forth.\n\nExercise is always important because first, you get the anxiety out of your body, and second, a positive change in your hormones.\n\nYour gut bacteria plays a MASSIVE role in your mood.\n\nMost of the \u201cfeel good\u201d serotonin is produced in your gut.\n\nSo, having healthy probiotics is very important. In fact, there are 3 specific stains that are scientifically researched to work.\n\nProper breathing is very important. When you feel anxiety, exhale longer than you inhale. For example, you take a deep breath for 3 seconds, then slowly exhale for 6 seconds.\n\nThere\u2019s a specific 4-7-8 breathing method that\u2019s awesome.\n\nProper sleep is crucial because the lack of it reduces melatonin production, increases stress hormones, and decreases sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen \u2013 all of which will most definitely trigger more anxiety.\n\nYou Don\u2019t Have To Label Yourself As Anxious Person\n\nI\u2019ll end today\u2019s topic by saying that just because you\u2019re prone to having anxiety, doesn\u2019t mean you have to label yourself as an anxious person.\n\nYes, genetics, hormones, age, sex, upbringing, and lifestyle all play a big role and most of this, YOU do have control over.\n\nRemember, what you focus on expands.\n\nYou need to strengthen your \u201cpositive attitude\u201d and \u201cgrateful\u201d muscles \u2013 which you do have control over. You just need to use them more often.\n\nPeople who have a lot of anxiety quickly go to a bad place.\n\nI personally had to train myself to stop and then go to a more positive place.\n\nInstead of saying \u201cwhat if something bad happens\u2026\u201d I focused on \u201cwhat if something good happens\u201d.\n\nIt took time until it became a habit.\n\nI also take specific vitamins & herbs that help improve brain chemicals, which will help reduce these \u201cnegative\u201d, disempowering emotions and feelings.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

You don\u2019t even have to change your diet or exercise either.\n\nOne simple way to support healthy blood pressure is to use a specific form of Hawthorn Berries.\n\nThese berries work through multiple mechanisms.\n\nDilate and widen blood vessels and arteries, which reduces the pressure and stress on your heart.\n\nIt acts as a natural and safe ACE (angiotensin-converting-enzyme) inhibitor, which are drug used to lower blood pressure\n\nHelps regulate your body\u2019s stress response, including lowering Cortisol levels.1,2 This is exciting news because, for the first time ever, you can address the psychological side of blood pressure, which is rarely dealt with.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Form Of Hawthorn Berries?\n\nDon\u2019t drink the juice or eat the berries.

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal a simple technique you can use anywhere at any time, to help reduce anxiety or worry, especially during those stressful or panic situations.\n\nAs an added bonus, it can help you sleep as well, when you\u2019re laying in bed and can\u2019t stop your brain from thinking \u2013 which is how I discovered it and use it.\n\nYears ago, I had a friend who was really high-strung. She was always worrying about everything. She would complain about having anxious feelings all the time.\n\nAnd trying to talk with her, rationalize things, etc. just didn\u2019t work. Her anxiety was very emotionally driven \u2013 probably a combination of hormones and neurotransmitters.\n\nHowever, there were a few moments in the day when she did relax and it always happened when she\u2019d take a smoking break.\n\nYup \u2013 she\u2019d go outside, light up a cigarette, and you can quickly see her mood change. She would even say, \u201cI wish I could stop smoking, but this really helps me cope with my anxious feelings, it relaxes me\u201d.\n\nIronically, the truth is that the substances in a cigarette, such as tobacco, are stimulants. They increase your heart rate. Thus, increasing adrenaline and stress hormones.\n\nHowever, there is one clear benefit of smoking that does help you relax and reduce your anxious feelings and that\u2019s the DEEP BREATHING a smoker does.\n\nIt\u2019s probably one of the few times in the day that my friend just stopped whatever she was doing, sat back, and breathed deeply while smoking her cigarette.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m not telling you to smoke, but I am telling you to take a 2-minute break in the day, any time you have some worry or anxious feelings, and take some deep breaths.\n\nThere is a simple breathing technique that can quickly help ease your anxious feelings in minutes. It\u2019s called the 4-7-8 method.\n\nHowever, before I tell you how to do it, I first need to tell you how to breathe correctly.\n\nSure, we all know how to breathe, but most of us are shallow breathers.\n\nAnd when you have anxious feelings or worry, your breathing becomes quicker and shallower, making things worse.\n\nAnd the first thing you want to do is learn how to breathe through your stomach. It\u2019s called Belly Breathing.\n\nWhen you take a deep breath, try to make your belly grow and not your chest.\n\nMeaning, just take a deep breath now and try to expand and grow your belly. Don\u2019t puff out your chest.\n\nYour chest may raise a little bit, because of the expansion of your belly. But the focus is on your stomach and not your chest.\n\n4-7-8 Method For Anxiety\n\nOkay, so now that you know the proper way to breathe through your belly, you\u2019re ready to utilize the 4-7-8 method.\n\nIt\u2019s really very simple.\n\nBreathe in through your nose for 4 seconds.\n\nHold your breath for 7 seconds.\n\nExhale through your mouth for 8 seconds.\n\nAnd one of the reasons you feel more relaxed is because of the improvements in your hormones and brain chemicals, caused by this slower, breathing pattern.\n\nI\u2019ve got more information about improving anxiety, worry, and your overall mood, with a few important resources, links, and articles. Make sure you check them out right now while it\u2019s fresh on your mind.\n\nAnd make sure you practice belly breathing at least once or twice daily, especially when driving in traffic and also before bed to help you sleep.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and our emotional health is suffering more NOW than ever in history.\n\nToday is an important topic and it\u2019s about anxiety, the different types of anxiety disorders and how it affects your health and daily performance. This includes BOTH adults over the age of 18 and well as teenagers, which sadly have even more anxiety than adults.\n\nKeep in mind that Anxiety disorders also often occur with other disorders such as depression, eating disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for both adults and children.\n\nI\u2019m going to quickly cover the various forms of anxiety.\n\nI\u2019ll also end with some natural ways to help make improvements in your feelings and emotions.\n\nIn a future article, I\u2019ll give a simple quiz so you can quickly find out if you have anxiety and how severe it is.\n\nHowever, statistically speaking, over 75% of the population has felt some form of anxiety.\n\nGlobally, 1 in 13 people suffers from anxiety on a regular basis.\n\nIn the US, anxiety disorders are the most common form of mental illness, affecting over 40 million adults over the age of 18. That\u2019s about 20% of the population.\n\nAnxiety disorders also affect over 25% of teenagers (children between 13 and 18 years old).\n\nResearch shows that untreated children with anxiety disorders are at higher risk to perform poorly in school, miss out on important social experiences, and engage in substance abuse.\n\nSo if you have children, please make sure you read this article and also share it with a friend who has children.\n\nUnfortunately, anxiety also negatively affects your emotional and physical health.\n\nPeople with an anxiety disorder are five times more likely to go to the doctor and six times more likely to be hospitalized for psychiatric disorders.\n\nAnd part of the reason for this is the internal stress you\u2019re dealing with, causes hormonal imbalances, which lowers your immune system, and causes fatigue.\n\nBecause there are so many different forms of anxiety disorders, the cause and development are complex and include primarily genetics, hormonal imbalances, and brain chemistry.\n\nHowever, life events, trauma, and lifestyle are all contributing factors.\n\nAnxiety And Depression\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that people with anxiety, also suffer from depression and vice versa. In fact, it\u2019s about 50% of the time \u2013 if you have one, you have the other.\n\nDifferent Forms Of Anxiety\n\nOkay, so let me quickly cover the 6 primary forms of anxiety and some important statistics. See which one you identify with the most\u2026\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\n\nGAD affects 7 million adults or 3% of the U.S. population, yet only 43% receive treatment.\n\nInterestingly, women are twice as likely to be affected as men and this is primarily because of the higher female hormones \u2014 more specifically, estrogens.\n\nPD have similar stats to GAD, affecting almost 6.5 million adults, or 2.7% of the U.S. population.\n\nAgain, women are twice as likely to be affected as men.\n\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (SAD)\n\nSAD affects 15 million adults or about 7% of the U.S. population, so this is a big one.\n\nSAD is equally common among men and women and typically begins around age 13\u2026 Right around puberty, when all the hormones begin to change.\n\nUnfortunately, 36% of people with social anxiety disorder report experiencing symptoms for 10 or more years before seeking any help. That\u2019s a lot of years to be \u201csuffering\u201d needlessly.\n\nI was surprised to find out that Specific phobias affect almost 20 million adults, or 9% of the U.S. population. I had no idea it was so high.\n\nOnce again, women are twice as likely to be affected as men.\n\nSymptoms typically begin in childhood; the average age-of-onset is 7 years old.\n\nPost-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\nPTSD affects almost 8 million adults, or 4% of the U.S. population.\n\nUnfortunately, rape is the most likely trigger of PTSD: 65% of men and 46% of women who are raped will develop the disorder.\n\nChildhood sexual abuse is a strong predictor of the lifetime likelihood for developing PTSD.\n\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n\nAnd finally, we have OCD, which affects about 2 million adults, or 1.0% of the U.S. population.\n\nOCD is equally common among men and women.\n\nThe average age of onset is 19, with 25% of cases occurring by age 13 \u2013 again, around the time of puberty and hormonal changes.\n\nThere are lots of treatments.\n\nOf course, we\u2019ve all heard of prescription drugs and I\u2019m sure you know someone who has taken an anti-anxiety or antidepressant. Maybe even yourself.\n\nUnfortunately, 95% of the time, these drugs are incorrectly prescribed. Resulting in more problems later, including addiction.\n\nDrugs are powerful and there are so many different ones. So, I\u2019d prefer using this as a LAST option and making sure you find a really good doctor who will FIRST listen thoroughly, before prescribing any drug.\n\nAnd do so at a lower dosage, see how you react and adjust accordingly.\n\nI think therapy is great. Of course, it takes time \u2014 many weeks, months and even years. So, you need to be patient.\n\nAnd finding a good therapist is probably the biggest challenge.\n\nWhat I love about the Internet is you really have access to almost everything, this includes finding a licensed therapist and professional counselor. In fact, it can all be done online, so you can do it at the comfort of your own home.\n\nOne place you may want to visit, that I\u2019ve heard good things about is BetterHelp.com. I haven\u2019t used their service, so I can\u2019t personally endorse it. But, it doesn\u2019t hurt to take a look.\n\nLifestyle Improvements\n\nAs I stated earlier, genetics aside \u2014 a major cause of anxiety and depression is the imbalance in hormones and brain chemistry. And lifestyle for sure affects this.\n\nThe topic of hormones it just too complicated to get into in today\u2019s article.\n\nYou also need to improve your diet \u2014 this means getting rid of addictive foods, sugars, bad fats, and optimizing your insulin levels.\n\nExercise is very important because it helps create positive, \u201chappy\u201d hormones, and brain chemicals. I\u2019ll keep this very simple \u2013 spend 30 minutes daily, MOVING your body and using your muscles. Preferably, outside in the sun.\n\nEven going for a simple, 15 min walk will \u201creboot\u201d your system and you\u2019ll feel better.\n\nFinally, there are natural herbs, plant extracts, and specific amino acids that can help promote better brain chemistry by supporting healthy levels of dopamine, serotonin, and cortisol levels.\n\nALL of which can affect your mood \u2013 both mental AND physical.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to magically \u201cfix\u201d things (nothing will)\u2026\n\nHowever, natural ingredients can give many people some quick relief from these \u201cdisempowering\u201d emotions.\n\nThey can help improve your mood.\n\nThey can help relax your body and mind.\n\nThey can help deal with those days or times of \u201cextra stress\u201d that so many of us are dealing with.\n\nEither way, they are much safer than drugs \u2013 that\u2019s for sure.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "Years ago I did an article about Ashwagandha and how it works, the benefits, pros, cons, warnings, and which is the best form.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a decade (2025) since that original article and I\u2019ve learned a LOT more since then about this awesome herbal extract.\n\nAnd unfortunately, how most of us are getting completely ripped off and wasting money!\n\nAnd before I begin\u2026. today\u2019s topic is very important for anyone interested in:\n\nLowering stress hormones such as cortisol\n\nImproving other hormones, such as testosterone and growth hormone\n\nDecreasing stress levels, worry, and anxiety\n\nImproving deeper and more restful sleep\n\nHaving better muscle-building and fat-burning workouts and results\n\nAs I said, this is one of my favorite topics because this is one of the best and most important ways of looking and feeling better, while slowing down the aging process and living a longer, healthier, and happier life.\n\nAND one of the keys to reducing many illnesses and health problems.\n\nAgain, all related to lowering stress and improving your youth hormones.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s get started\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s an herbal extract that\u2019s been used for hundreds and thousands of years for\n\nLowering stress levels\n\nIncreasing virility and sex drive\n\nAnd it helps accomplish these benefits by improving & BALANCING your hormone levels.\n\nStep 1 \u2013 promoting lower stress hormones such as cortisol.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 By lowering excess cortisol, your body will indirectly increase your testosterone levels.\n\nProblem With Ashwagandha\n\nUnfortunately, like most herbs and supplements, they do NOT work.\n\nThey are complete rip-offs because they are NOT using the correct:\n\nWhich is found in human clinical studies and ultimately, what has worked in the \u201cempirical\u201d evidence, and thus, in the REAL world.\n\nDo NOT Use The WRONG Forms\n\nFirstly, you always want to use a high extract form of any herb, especially Ashwagandha.\n\nThis is where most companies will rip us off.\n\nAn extract form is the POTENCY of the herb.\n\nSo you want a minimum of 10% and up to 30% extract when it comes to Ashwagandha\u2026 and I\u2019ll expand more on this in a minute.\n\nYou never want to get the \u201cpowdered\u201d version, which is just junk because it does NOT contain any of the active ingredients which has all the benefits.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t want the low extract forms or else you\u2019ll have to take like 4-10x the dose and hence, a big waste of money.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s like getting 5, $1 bills\u2026 versus getting 3, $20, or even $100 bills.\n\nIt\u2019s $5 versus $60 or $300 dollars.\n\nI\u2019m not going to be negative and point out all the bad companies. Besides, there are too many of them.\n\nI\u2019ll give you the best ones below\u2026\n\n2 Best Forms of Ashwagandha\n\nThe two best, clinically proven in dozens of human clinical studies are KSM-66 and Sensoril.\n\nI\u2019ve tested both of these, by themselves. From very low dosages to very high doses\n\nI wanted to see how each of these affects both my hormones and stress levels, as well as how I FEEL.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the difference between the two.\n\nKSM-66 gave me a more energized feel. I was focused but had more energy.\n\nSo, I take this during the day.\n\nSensoril made me feel more relaxed. It has a more calming effect. It helps lower anxious feelings.\n\nSo I take it more after my workouts and before bed, to help me relax and sleep.\n\nHowever, EACH of these does have its specific benefits and after doing a ton of blood work on myself, my pro athletes, and clients, I ended up combining the two for maximum positive effects.\n\nThis also helps save you money because you don\u2019t need to take as much.\n\nIt\u2019s all the synergy.\n\nBest All-In-One Formula\n\nI use two different products that contain the correct forms and dosages of Ashwagandha.\n\nIn AlphaViril, I\u2019m using 75% KSM-66 and 25% Sensoril combo. More KSM-66 and less Sensoril.\n\nThis is giving me all the hormonal benefits while energizing me as well.\n\nAnd this is one reason you take AlphaViril in the morning and around noon.\n\nGreat for libido, sex drive, more testosterone, lower cortisol levels, much harder, bigger and fuller erections.\n\nAnd thus, you do NOT take AlphaViril before bed.\n\nBecause it optimizes your testosterone and sex hormones, you can perform any time, any place. So, don\u2019t think you need it right before bed to perform or something.\n\nAlphaViril\u2019s primary goal is more testosterone. The secondary is lowering cortisol. Of course, it has lots of other hormonal benefits.\n\nMore details are below at the end of this article.\n\nHowever, Stress & Cortisol Relief is very specific for lowering stress hormones + cortisol levels.\n\nI use the opposite combination of the two \u2026 75% Sensoril and 25% KSM-66.\n\nI also use double the dose of both ingredients because my primary goal with Stress & Cortisol Relief is to lower stress hormones and improve adrenal function.\n\nI take Stress & Cortisol Relief after my workouts and before bed.\n\nDepending on your goal, you choose what you think you need the most.\n\nI personally take BOTH products because I want maximum muscle, libido, fat loss\u2026 and minimal stress levels.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t take them all the time, or every single day.\n\nI don\u2019t want you to waste your money, nor my own.\n\nAgain, more details about both of these awesome products, below at the end of this article. Including discounts and coupons.\n\nNeedless to say, Ashwagandha is an awesome herb for lowering your stress hormones and improving your anti-aging hormones such as testosterone.\n\nIt helps to also lower anxiety and helps you sleep better as well.\n\nSomething we all need.\n\nJust make sure you get the correct extract form and dosage.\n\nThe best and most clinically proven are KSM-66 and Sensoril.\n\nUse KSM-66 more during the day and Sensoril more at night.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with stress!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve \"healthy stress hormone levels\" with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://ksm66ashwagandhaa.com/clinical-studies/\n\nhttp://natreoninc.com/sensoril/",

    "content": "Caffeine is probably the most used or even abused drug in the world. Yes, it\u2019s a drug.\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy is that in 2025 about 90% of Americans consume caffeine on a daily basis.\n\nCoffee consumption is about 40% of the world\u2019s population. And much higher in the US, at about 70%.\n\nThe point is, that most of us have a bunch of caffeine running through our veins.\n\nHow Does Caffeine Affect Your Blood Flow?\n\nCaffeine and caffeine products can negatively affect your circulation.\n\nIt acts as a vasoconstrictor and constricts blood vessels, thus \u2013 can decrease blood flow.\n\nCaffeine has been shown to make arteries stiff which contributes to coronary artery disease or hardening of the arteries.\n\nIt also increases blood pressure levels because it blocks hormones your body produces to keep your arteries wide open.\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant, it increases adrenaline, as well as stress hormones such as cortisol. This \u201cfight or flight\u201d mechanism further restricts blood flow.\n\nIt also causes anxiety, which again indirectly decreases blood flow due to negative changes in neurotransmitters.\n\nCaffeine has a long half-life and it negatively affects sleep. Poor sleep quality and quantity further increase stress hormones, as well as blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and yes, these all decrease circulation\n\nIf you do want to support healthy blood flow for improving heart and brain health, more youthful skin and hair, and better sexual performance and erections for men \u2013 then you have two options.\n\nIf you\u2019re not going to stop consuming caffeine, at least try to lower the caffeine intake by at least half.\n\nOr, just take specific vitamins, minerals, and herbs that will help support healthy blood flow and circulation. These will also help undo the damage caused over the years and you can still enjoy your caffeine.\n\nImportant \"Blood Flow & Circulation\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood flow & circulation is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood flow\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19049813\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935999\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18088379\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27527212\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26899133",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness/how-anxiety-causes-muscle-loss-fat-gain/",
    "content": "I get a lot of guys in 2025 asking how they can gain muscle and/or lose fat. They\u2019ll say they\u2019re \u201chard gainers\u201d and thus, have a very hard time gaining any muscle.\n\nThen they tell me they\u2019ve tried everything and nothing works.\n\nFor example, they\u2019ll eat more food and they do gain weight, but it ends up being mostly fat.\n\nOr they are exercising too much and they cut back, to allow more recovery and let the muscle grow, but then end up again getting fatter with very little muscle growth.\n\nThey\u2019ll try heavyweights, lightweights, low or high reps, and all sorts of different workouts trying to gain muscle, but nothing seems to ever work.\n\nOr if it does, it\u2019s temporary and something stressful happens in their life and they quickly lose all the newly gained muscle.\n\nAnd thus, they feel very frustrated and hopeless. They feel like giving up.\n\nOf course, there are correct ways to do all of this and I\u2019ll show you how in future articles.\n\nHowever, I totally understand and relate to \u201chard gainers\u201d because I was the same way.\n\nWhen I first started working out, I was 6\u20191\u201d and only weighed 145 lbs. Obviously, very light.\n\nAfter a year of working out, instead of gaining weight, I actually lost 15 lbs. I only weighed 130 lbs. I was basically anorexic.\n\nI did all the wrong things and I\u2019ll tell you about them all in future articles, so you don\u2019t make the same mistakes.\n\nSo, I totally get it and I feel your pain.\n\nHowever, the good news is that after years of trying different diets, workouts, supplements and so forth, I very slowly gained a little bit muscle each year to my current weight of about 205 lbs at 6\u20193\u201d.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s still not very big. I wish I had another 10 lbs of muscle. But, it\u2019s big enough for my genetics and the fact that I\u2019m natural and almost 50 years old.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll get deeper into this topic and all that I\u2019ve learned, in future articles, including my workouts, diets, and supplements.\n\nHowever, today I want to talk about a topic that is rarely spoken about when it comes to gaining muscle and/or losing fat and that\u2019s \u2013 controlling stress and worry.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed over the years that \u201chard gainers\u201d and people who have difficulty gaining muscle and keeping it, tend to have a lot of nervous energy.\n\nThey worry more, feel more stressed, and aren\u2019t very good sleepers.\n\nThey\u2019re not typically, \u201ceasy going\u201d people. They tend to be more Type A personalities.\n\nAnd, this is my own problem as well, something I still deal with to this day.\n\nAnd the problem is when you have worry and stress, your body\u2019s cortisol, and stress hormones go up. This eats away at your muscle and increases body fat.\n\nAt the same time, high-stress hormones, such as cortisol, decrease anabolic hormones such as testosterone.\n\nSo the imbalance in these two hormones alone causes muscle loss and fat gain at the same time. This is why some people are called, \u201cskinny-fat\u201d.\n\nAlso, the ratio of testosterone to estrogen changes and you become more estrogen dominant. And higher estrogen levels cause more anxious feelings and worry.\n\nAdditionally,worry, and stress cause other hormonal and chemical imbalances, such as high insulin levels and decrease neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin.\n\nWhen dopamine and serotonin drop, so does your happiness, drive, and emotional well-being. Ironically, there is also an increase in anxious feelings because of this.\n\nSo my point with all of this is that hard-gainers, generally have more anxious feelings and worry more. This causes negative hormonal and chemical changes, which causes more stress and worry.\n\nAnd all of this makes gaining muscle and losing fat very difficult \u2013 regardless of how perfect your diet or exercise program is.\n\nSo the solution here is you need to learn to relax more. Don\u2019t think the worst all the time. Don\u2019t fly off the handle and freak out. Don\u2019t dwell on the past or worry about the future.\n\nTry to live in the moment. Have more gratitude and appreciation in your life, instead of expectations.\n\nTry to meditate if you can or just put aside 15 minutes daily to go for a nice walk or close your eyes and clear your mind.\n\nAnd make sure you get better and deeper sleep. This is a big game changer and will allow you to gain more muscle and lose fat easier.\n\nAnd yes, this is all easier said than done. It does take time, practice, and making new habits.\n\nBut it\u2019s well worth it. You\u2019ll look and feel better.\n\nOf course, we all need help, especially at the beginning.\n\nIt\u2019s time you discover a special formula I use about an hour before bed, that helps me relax. It dramatically decreases my tension, worry and any feelings of stress and worry.\n\nIt improves my hormones, cortisol, serotonin and dopamine levels.\n\nAnd best of all, it helps me get a deeper and better sleep.\n\nAll of this translates to better recovery, improved hormones, and thus, more muscle and lower body fat.\n\nAnd you can use this formula any time you\u2019re under extra stress.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "One of Mom\u2019s best home remedies for trouble going to sleep was a steaming hot cup of chamomile tea. It was always a hated remedy as a kid because there was never any sugar in the tea. You\u2019d get a cup of hot water, feel like complaining\u2026 and then end up asleep in the next 10 minutes max. This very fragrant tea has the ability to boost immune systems, ease muscle cramps, and even provide a level of help with an upset stomach.\n\nDoes it also help with anxiety? There is some research that seems to indicate that it can. Moms for several generations have claimed that it has this power and science is finally starting to catch up with what lots of moms already know. Let\u2019s take a look to see if it could help you.\n\nChamomile Tea Is Proven To Reduce Stress Levels\n\nThe cost of going to the doctor is going up in a lot of places around the world. It\u2019s becoming difficult to justify the expense of see the doc, especially if the only problem you\u2019ve got is a higher level of anxiety going on daily. The issue, however, is that when these worries are present every day, they can turn into a habit that\u2019s called a \u201cGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\u2019 that can literally dominate your mindset. How could a simple tea like chamomile help this problem?\n\nThe first aspect to consider about chamomile is that it acts as a nerve relaxant. One of the biggest problems that people with anxiety typically face is an over-stimulated nervous system. It\u2019s one of the reasons why panic attacks can be triggered by caffeine products! Even if you just surround yourself with the fragrance of chamomile, you can benefit from the nerve relaxation that this tea can provide. Once those nerves are relaxed, the stress can begin to reduce.\n\nWill Just One Cup Provide Benefits?\n\nYou can experience the benefits of anxiety reduction from chamomile tea with just one cup, but those effects are small and often very temporary. If you want to maximize the effects of what this beneficial tea can provide, then it needs to become part of your daily routine. If you have a cup of chamomile in the morning with breakfast and then another cup of tea in the evening with dinner, you\u2019ll create a recipe for success to fight off panic.\n\nImagine being able to control your anxiety without having prescription medications that can cause a lot of difficult and often unpleasant side effects. Imagine being able to go out into public without being asked about the antidepressants that could be in your pack or purse right now? That\u2019s what can happen if you regularly take chamomile tea and consult with your doctor about its benefits.\n\nThere are several types of chamomile available today, but seek out the Roman and German varieties of this tea to get the maximum effects from it. When you do, then your anxiety relief could be just a sip or two away.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "title": "Using Librax for Anxiety | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness-se/using-librax-for-anxiety/",
    "content": "Treating anxiety is a tricky matter for most people as they do not want to become addicted to a medication or take it for so long that their body becomes tolerant to the effect and therefore is useless in controlling an anxiety attack.\n\nHowever, there are certain types of drugs that can be taken for long periods of time to control anxiety levels and still not have the body become tolerant of the overall effects. Librax is one such drug that many people are taking for anxiety, but exactly how does it work.\n\nLibrax is a combination of Clidinium Bromide and Librium. Clidinium Bromide is used mostly for digestive issues that helps the Librium become fully absorbed in the body. Librium is related to Xanax, although it is a far less potent version of that drug. While only about 20% as strong, Librium will actually last in the body far longer that Xanax which helps greatly in the treatment of anxiety.\n\nIt is true that Librium itself is actually quite good in the treatment of general anxiety that is of a low level in nature. Xanax on the other hand is much better for higher levels of anxiety that have a specific cause or reason. Xanax is very good against panic attacks and specific triggers that can raise your anxiety levels considerably.\n\nThe Long Lasting Effects of Librax\n\nUnlike Benzos which is also used for anxiety, Librium and Xanax can be taken for long periods of time without incurring any toleration issues. This is because both drugs have multiple effects on the body which means that it will adjust to certain conditions and not others. In the case of Xanax, you will generally feel drowsy when first taking the drug. After the while, your body will overcome the drowsy feelings, but the effect it has on your anxiety levels remains intact. This is also true of Librium or Librax as well. This means that for most people they can take the drugs for many years without running the risk of over-toleration or addiction.\n\nOf course, not everyone is immune to addiction and even Librax may run the risk for certain people. However, if you have no family history of addiction or have an addiction yourself, then it is most likely that you will not become addicted to Librax or Librium. Naturally, the doses that need to be taken should be in line with the anxiety level of the person. Taking very high doses over a long period of time may cause consequences that develop years down the line, but normal amounts do not carry that danger.\n\nFor those who have relatively low levels of anxiety that is constant, taking Librax is an excellent form of treatment that will keep the anxiety in check. For those who are not sure about any potential side effects or becoming addicted to Librax, they need to contact their doctor in order to get the right dosage and assurances about the overall effect of the drug itself.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "Both Clonazepam and Xanax are drugs known as benzodiazepines that are designed to calm a person down who is suffering from anxiety attacks as well as treating other types of disorders. However, generally speaking each drug is designed to combat panic and anxiety that is associated with depression. Clonazepam for example may also be used for those who have epilepsy, OCD, clinical depression and seizures.\n\nXanax, which is also known as Alprazolam, was first patented in 1969 when it was released to the public shortly afterward. Xanax is the first approved drug for use against panic disorder and has been the most widely used as well as abused on the US market ever since. While some experts state that the effects of misusing the drug are low, there is no question that it has been over-prescribed in many cases for symptoms that do not rise to the level of taking medication.\n\nClonazepam, also known as Klonopin in the US, has also been used to treat anxiety disorders for people around the world under various brand names. It is a more recent drug than Xanax, but that does not necessarily make it more effective. It is however one that does offer a high rate of success with little potential for overdosing as it has low levels of toxicity. However, like Xanax it also has similar side effects which may make it difficult to drive or perform complex tasks.\n\nTreatment and Symptoms\n\nEach drug has treated millions of people around the world who suffer from symptoms of anxiety. There are a considerable number of similarities between the drugs starting with their overall effect on the brain. The purpose of each is to increase the effect of the gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA that brings about a calming effect to the nervous system. The effect is such that it may actually go further to cause drowsiness or even a sedative-type effect that can make driving or operating heavy machinery quite dangerous.\n\nOver the years, there have been various studies performed to compare the effects of each drug on anxiety attacks and the results have been uniformly the same. While everyone reacts to medications in their own particular way, the studies that have been conducted so far have not shown any significant difference between each one.\n\nThe Differences Between Clonazepam and Xanax\n\nAlthough the overall effect is similar, there are some differences between each drug. Clonazepam for example is also prescribed for different types of medical conditions as mentioned before while Xanax is pretty much for anxiety and panic attacks that are associated with depression. However, other than the application for how each drug is prescribed, there does seem to be very little difference in terms of effect.\n\nIn fact, the differences between each drug is so minimal in terms of its overall effectiveness that your doctor may prescribe one first to see its effects and then switch to the other if the desired results are not achieved. For millions of people who suffer from anxiety or panic attacks that are rooted in depression, taking Clonazepam or Xanax may very well be the right answer.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

It\u2019s an \u201call-in-one\u201d supplement that already combines everything that I just listed, in specific extracted dosages \u2014 in addition to a couple other helpful ingredients.\n\nAre You Glass Half \u201cFull\u201d or \u201cEmpty\u201d?\n\nHave you noticed in life that some people tend to generally just be happy, positive people? They laugh more, they seem confident and hopeful about life. They handle stressful situations well, and stay calm and cool.\n\nThey\u2019re basically the \u201cglass half FULL\u201d people.\n\nAnd of course I\u2019m sure you know some people are who tend to be negative about life. Critical and hopeless. They get stressed out quickly and have anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nThey feel nervous in social settings. They worry a lot, have sleep problems and tend to get depressed and \u201cdown\u201d, more often than they\u2019d like to admit.\n\nYou know\u2026 the \u201cglass half EMPTY\u201d people.\n\nThe Real Cause \u2013 Nature Or Nurture?\n\nIf you ask most people why a person is the way they are \u2013 they\u2019ll generally say it\u2019s because of the person\u2019s \u201cattitude\u201d\u2026 their \u201cup-bring\u201d\u2026 or they CHOOSE to be this way.\n\nNow, this is true to a certain extent. But science has proven repeatedly that over 50% of \u201chappiness\u201d is based on your GENETICS!8\n\nSo if you tend to be a person who feels more anxiety or panic attacks \u2026 or is \u201csuper sensitive\u201d and even gets depressed from time to time \u2013 guess what, it may NOT be your fault!\n\n\u2026 to a certain extent.\n\nGenetics does play a big role in how you feel, but what\u2019s behind all of this are your HORMONES and NEUROTRANSMITTERS8 \u2026 Something that you CAN improve on, which is the good news and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to discuss today.\n\nSo don\u2019t worry, there is HOPE and you can easily do it!\n\nControlling The \u201cBig 3\u2033\n\nWithout turning this into a biology class in medical school, I\u2019m going to keep things simple. There are 3 primary hormones and neurotransmitters we want to \u201ccontrol\u201d, which can help make dramatic improvements in your mood, happiness, and sense of well-being.\n\nAnd these are Dopamine, Serotonin and Cortisol\n\nThe great part about making improvements to these 3 is that you\u2019ll also SLOW DOWN AGING and thus, look and feel younger!\n\nGoal #1 = Optimize Serotonin\n\nThis is a neurotransmitter which is located primarily in your GI tract (your stomach) and also your Central Nervous System (CNS).10 People tend to refer to it as the \u201chappy hormone\u201d, even though it\u2019s not a hormone \u2026 Mainly because drugs such as Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft work by optimizing Serotonin.10\n\nSerotonin may be low if you:\n\ncrave sugary, salty foods or caffeine\n\ntend to be \u201cmoody\u201d or extra \u201csensitive\u201d\n\nget anxiety or panic attacks\n\ncan\u2019t seem to \u201clet go\u201d of the past or you dwell on negative thoughts\n\nGoal #2 = Increase Dopamine\n\nThis is known as the anti-aging \u201cpleasure chemical\u201d, which acts as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter.9\n\nIt\u2019s very powerful because it plays a major role in motivation. Many addictive drugs work on Dopamine receptors.9 The lack of dopamine is also the primary cause of Parkinson\u2019s.9\n\nDopamine may be low if you:\n\nhave memory problems or hard time focusing\n\nhave a decrease in libido\n\nfeel unmotivated, lost your \u201cdrive\u201d about life\n\ndon\u2019t want to interact with people and you feel hopeless or depressed\n\nGoal #3 = Decrease Cortisol\n\nCortisol is known as the \u201cStress Hormone\u201d. When you don\u2019t sleep well, when you\u2019re angry, tired, feel over-worked and under lots of stress or pressure,\u2026 then your Cortisol levels dramatically shoots up.11\n\nThis is your body\u2019s coping mechanism to stress \u2013 so you do need some cortisol to survive and function.11\n\nHowever, elevated cortisol causes\n\nan increase in blood sugar and blood pressure\n\nmuscle loss and extra fat around your belly\n\nlowered testosterone in men and feelings of anger in women\n\ndramatically increases aging, wrinkles and hair loss.\n\nUnfortunately because of today\u2019s extra stressful life-styles, it\u2019s estimated that 87% of the population has chronically elevated cortisol.11\n\nAnd if you have any caffeine \u2013 coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc. \u2013 you are 100% guaranteed to have elevated cortisol.11\n\nLet\u2019s Do This Naturally, NO DRUGS\n\nSo forget about using anti-anxiety or anti-depression drugs. Not only do they have lots of long-term side-effects, but they BARELY work.\n\nIn a 2008 study done by Harvard Medical School, 82% of users said they felt ZERO improvement taking medications.12 Yet, 67% reported negative side-effects.12\n\nBut luckily there are specific herbs, vitamins and amino acids that DO work in improving your Serotonin, Dopamine and Cortisol levels, which results in improvement in both mental and physical well-being.\n\nWARNING \u2013 It\u2019s All About The \u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nEarlier I mentioned about 8-10 of the best supplements that are scientifically researched to safely help reduce stress, anxiety, depression and help improve your mood and give you better sleep.\n\nAs great as these individual ingredients are, they work MUCH BETTER when combined together because there is a special \u201csynergy\u201d, which creates better results without any negative side-effects.\n\nSo basically, you take less and get more results!\n\nBecause of this synergy, I personally utilize an \u201call-in-one\u201d natural remedy called ProVanax\u2122, which contains all of these key ingredients, in one simple pill. So it\u2019s convenient and saves me time and money.\n\nThe feedback has been amazing and since the product has been around since 1999, you know it works!\n\nAnyways, there\u2019s a free video about how ProVanax\u2122 works, how you\u2019ll benefit, the clinical studies, hundreds of customer reviews, etc\u2026\n\nIf you want to try something natural that works quickly, I suggest your give ProVanax\u2122 a try.

These can all be seen and measured.\n\nThese types of topics are also what people tend to talk about in PUBLIC\u2026\n\nHowever, \u201cmental\u201d and emotional health is something that\u2019s talked about in PRIVATE \u2026 or, not even talked about at all.\n\nAnd the truth is, I believe emotional health is even MORE important than physical health!\n\nMost Important Aspect Of Health\n\nI say this because when you\u2019re worried, stressed, sad, feeling anxious, and so forth \u2013 you don\u2019t function at your best.\n\nYour thoughts are not clear.

Reduces cortisol, improves dopamine and serotonin levels, and has so many other benefits.\n\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t last all day long \u2013 so \u201cmove often\u201d.\n\nPlants and herbs have amazing healing abilities.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness/5-common-foods-that-cause-or-increase-depression/",
    "content": "Most people don\u2019t realize that your emotions can influence what you eat. For example, when you\u2019re under extra stress (emotional or physical), your body and brain will crave more sugar and carbohydrates. One reason is that it wants to help increase serotonin and dopamine levels.\n\nWomen see this happen more often during their menstrual cycles due to their hormonal changes and thus, various cravings occur.\n\nHowever, what you eat can also influence your mood. So the reverse can happen.\n\nThese 5 Foods = Depressive Feelings\n\nAnd today I\u2019m going to reveal 5 common foods that can decrease your mood, deplete your body, increase negative feelings, and thus, even cause or increase depressive feelings.\n\nSimple food changes, such as avoiding or limiting today\u2019s 5 foods, can be the difference between feeling much worse or actually feeling more stable, better, and happier.\n\nI\u2019ll also give you alternative solutions.\n\nAnd this is very important, especially considering that over 7% of the American population over the age of 18 is diagnosed with clinical depressive feelings.\n\nThis does not take into account teenagers, who also deal with a lot of depressive feelings.\n\nThis also does NOT take into account all the people who haven\u2019t been tested, who haven\u2019t sought out help, or simply, just feel really down or depressive \u2026 without the \u201cofficial diagnoses\u201d.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re feeling down or depressed, you\u2019re not alone. And, it may not be your fault. It could be related to the foods you\u2019re eating.\n\nThere\u2019s hope and at the end of today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll also give you a really effective solution that you can use to help rebalance and optimize brain chemicals, so you can feel happier and reduce feelings of sadness worry, and anxious feelings.\n\nSugar and salt are found in almost all foods, especially those that taste good. However, in a 2015 study1, it revealed that the increase in added sugars in one\u2019s diet was associated with an increased likelihood of depressive feelings.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s a correlation between feelings of sadness, blood sugar problems, and memory loss. And the researchers have discovered that when blood glucose levels are elevated, levels of the protein that encourages the growth of neurons and synapses, drop.\n\nTranslation: The simple act of eating sugar makes your brain work at a suboptimal level \u2014 and the more you do it, the greater your risk of sadness and the greater your risk of blood sugar problems and memory loss, too.\n\nSOLUTION: Just read the labels and limit \u201csugars\u201d whenever possible, especially when you\u2019re not feeling 100%.\n\nArtificial Sweeteners\n\nThis includes artificial sweeteners, especially Aspartame (NutraSweet or Equal), which is found in diet sodas and \u201cno sugar\u201d food because it blocks the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This can cause various neuro and head problems such as headaches, insomnia, changes in mood\u2014and yes, depressive feelings.\n\nSOLUTION: Avoid all artificial sweeteners. Instead, use natural ones such as Stevia, which is an herbal extract.\n\nHydrogenated oils can be found in most fried foods, as well as packaged \u201cjunk\u201d foods \u2014 such as cookies, cakes, candies, chips, crackers, margarine, and spreads.\n\nHydrogenation happens when you take vegetable oils and heat them or make them into solids. This also causes trans fats, which is the worst type of fat to consume.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve simplified this process, leaving out the boring chemical stuff because the point is, you want to avoid these fats.\n\nNot only do they cause weight gain, inflammation, and other physical problems \u2013 but they\u2019re also linked to mood changes.\n\nSOLUTION: Read labels, and avoid hydrogenated and trans fats. At home, it\u2019s best to NOT heat or cook with vegetable or seed oils. Have those cold, like on a salad. If cooking, choose a saturated fat such as butter or better yet, coconut oil \u2014 which happens to have health benefits for your body and mind.\n\nMost people aren\u2019t going to like hearing this, especially since Alcohol is the drug of choice when people are feeling \u201cdown\u201d and hopeless.\n\nHowever, alcohol is a depressant, and more specifically, depresses your central nervous system (CNS) which controls how you feel, physically, and emotionally. It controls so many of your neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, etc).\n\nSOLUTION: Limit or avoid alcohol, especially when you\u2019re feeling down, hopeless, or depressed. It\u2019s just going to make it worse!\n\nPersonally, I love caffeine because it gives me energy, and focus, and actually makes me happier. However, that\u2019s only because I RARELY have any. I may have about 50 mg, 3x weekly before I go to the gym.\n\nThat\u2019s less than half a cup of regular coffee, not even strong coffee.\n\nNow, the reason caffeine can cause depressive feelings is 3 primary reasons:\n\nChronic and daily caffeine use (multiple cups of coffee, energy drinks, etc.) stresses your Central Nervous System (CNS) and increases your stress hormone, cortisol \u2013 which can lead to mood changes.\n\nThe stress on your CNS also depletes important neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, and serotonin, which affect your mood and happiness.\n\nCaffeine, especially when consumed later in the day, disrupts sleep, which decreases healing, and proper hormonal production at night and thus, causes fatigue \u2013 both physically and emotionally, which can lead to mood changes.\n\nSOLUTION: Limit your caffeine usage to the morning, maybe just once daily. And try to avoid energy drinks, which tend to have 3-10X the amount of caffeine compared to a cup of coffee. Plus, energy drinks have either sugar or artificial sweeteners \u2013 both of which you discovered today, is BAD for your health and mood.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll notice is that sugar, artificial sweeteners, hydrogenated oils, alcohol, and caffeine all contribute to negative feelings, and emotions, because they negatively alter important brain chemicals and neurotransmitters, which are responsible for your mood.\n\nThese include serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin, and cortisol \u2013 just to name a few.\n\nSo, do your best to limit and avoid these foods, especially when you\u2019re feeling down.\n\nAdditionally, utilize natural solutions, vitamins, herbs, and minerals that are clinically proven to help improve, rebalance, and optimize these key chemicals and neurotransmitters.\n\nAnd for more details about this, copy the proven formula!\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

And I can guarantee there were many more people that didn\u2019t report anything, even though they had negative effects.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s disturbing is that these reports also included OVER 1 million deaths!1\n\nThat\u2019s far more than what \u201cillegal, street\u201d drugs cause!!!\n\nNow, today\u2019s topic is about 5 popular drugs known to cause irritability, nervousness, and panic attacks.\n\nAnd I\u2019m doing this topic in 2025 because I recently did two separate articles entitled,\n\nWhat Type Of Anxious Feelings Do You Have & How To Fix It\n\nHow Do You Know If You Have Anxious Feelings?\u2026 A Simple Quiz\n\nThe problem with anxious feelings is that when you have them, you also tend to beat yourself up.

People blame themselves and think there\u2019s something \u201cwrong\u201d with them.\n\nHowever, the CAUSE could simply be due to an external source, such as common prescription drugs.\n\nThus, YOU are not the problem \u2014 these drugs may be the REAL cause of anxious feelings.\n\nSo, with that said, let me quickly go over them and see if you are taking any of the following drugs or have recently been within the past 12 months.\n\nCaffeine is the most used and abused drug on the planet. It\u2019s very powerful and one that most people take for granted and don\u2019t even think of it as a \u201cdrug\u201d.\n\nLet me put it this way, Coca-Cola\u2019s original formula contained Cocaine, hence where the name \u201cCoca\u201d came from.\n\nWhen cocaine became illegal and they needed to find an alternative, they used caffeine as the substitute\u2026 thus, it\u2019s very effective and powerful.\n\nObviously, lots of \u201cnatural\u201d products contain caffeine \u2014 coffee, energy drinks, colas, tea, and so forth.\n\nHowever, so do a few medications, especially those used for headaches and migraines.\n\nFor example, Excedrin contains aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), and caffeine.\n\nJust make sure you read the label the next time you take pain medication, especially for your headache.\n\nCorticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones produced in the adrenal cortex, by both men and women.\n\nThese are not like \u201canabolic\u201d steroid hormones, that athletes and bodybuilders take to build muscle. These are, in fact, the opposite \u2026 they are \u201ccatabolic\u201d.\n\nAnabolic BUILDS and catabolic \u201cTEARS DOWN\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of the stress hormone, Cortisol\u2026 which is a corticosteroid.\n\nAnyway, as bad as these stress hormones are, they are vital for survival and one of the benefits they have is they help have a healthy inflammatory response.\n\nMany drugs which treat asthma, allergies, arthritis, bronchitis, and also pain, contain or are prescribed a form of Corticosteroid.\n\nCortisone injections or topical creams\u2026 Prednisone and Dexamethasone are all popular corticosteroid hormones in drug form.\n\nIn addition to causing weight gain, blood sugar and blood pressure problems, and muscle loss, they also cause irritability and anxious feelings.\n\nADHD drugs are one of the most often prescribed drugs in America. They are stimulants, \u201cuppers\u201d, very similar to an amphetamine.\n\nThey do cause temporary euphoria in many people because of the dopamine interaction. However, they also cause nervousness, rapid heart rate, anxious feelings, and panic attacks.\n\nTwo popular drugs that you may have heard of are Adderall (Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) and Ritalin (Methylphenidate, Concerta).\n\nHowever, other drugs which contain different forms of similar stimulants, all have the same negative, \u201canxious causing\u201d side effects.\n\nThere are actually two primary forms of asthma medications. One that gets treated with a Corticosteroid, which I discussed earlier.\n\nThe other is with a beta-agonist stimulant, such as Ephedrine, Albuterol, and Salmeterol.\n\nThey can cause mood disorders and depressive and anxious feelings.\n\nThis includes both pill and inhaler (bronchodilators) forms.\n\nMany people\u2019s thyroid glands tend to be underactive and thus, \u201cHypothyroid\u201d. This can happen due to aging and lack of iodine and/or tyrosine.\n\nThis is especially true for people on lower-calorie diets, ketogenic and low-carb diets, and even intermittent fasting diets.\n\nWomen tend to have lower thyroid production as well and are more susceptible to hypothyroidism.\n\nAnd because of this, your doctor may prescribe some form of thyroid medication.\n\nThe most popular is T4 (thyroxine), such as Synthroid (levothyroxine). There\u2019s also T3 (triiodothyronine) thyroid, such as Cytomel (liothyronine)\n\nFinally, there\u2019s Armour Thyroid, which is a natural blend of both T4 and T3.\n\nThese drugs increase your metabolism and also your heart rate, which can cause nervousness, shakiness, and anxious feelings.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to stop taking thyroid medication, but if you are feeling anxious feelings, you should have a talk with your doctor about adjusting the dosage. But do so very slowly.\n\nSo there you have it, 5 of the most popular drugs which can cause or increase anxious feelings, panic attacks, nervousness, and worry.\n\nYou may want to read this article again if you take any of these drugs since I did list a bunch of names.\n\nPlease also share this article with anyone you know, who takes any of these drugs. As I said, most people aren\u2019t aware that these common and popular drugs, can actually be the cause of their anxious feelings\u2026 or at least, make things much worse.\n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t just get off of these drugs. There aren\u2019t natural alternatives that work as well, especially during times of emergencies \u2014 such as asthma medications or Corticosteroids.\n\nHowever, many of these drugs ARE overprescribed and overdosed.\n\nIf you\u2019re taking these or similar drugs and are having anxious or similar feelings, speak to your doctor about changing medications or adjusting the dosage.\n\nAnd remember, these drugs have lingering effects. Just because you haven\u2019t taken them for a few weeks, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s still not in your system. Your body just needs more time to adjust.\n\nSo, please be patient.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.drugwatch.com/side-effects/",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/stress-cortisol/lower-cortisol-for-higher-testosterone-more-muscle-less-belly-fat/",
    "content": "In order for you to build more muscle and strength, you need to be more \u201canabolic\u201d, than \u201ccatabolic\u201d.\n\nYou need to increase \u201cprotein synthesis\u201d, rather than decrease it or reduce \u201cprotein oxidation\u201d.\n\nSo, what does this mean?\n\nAnabolic means to \u201cbuild\u201d\u2026\n\nCatabolic means to \u201ctear down\u201d\u2026\n\nWhen you take \u201canabolic steroids\u201d, you are increasing \u201canabolism\u201d and thus, the building of muscle.\n\nYou\u2019re increasing \u201cprotein synthesis\u201d\u2026 meaning, you\u2019re making MORE protein and thus, more muscle.\n\nHowever, what most people don\u2019t know is that anabolic steroids work by ALSO decreasing the catabolic effects of cortisol, the stress hormone.\n\nThis means you have a \u201cnet profit\u201d of more protein synthesis versus protein oxidation.\n\nIn fact, two of the most powerful steroids Dianabol and Trenbolone are extremely powerful at REDUCING the negative effects of cortisol.\n\nThe truth is that in the long run, steroids are actually more anti-catabolic than they are \u201canabolic\u201d.\n\nThey are doing more to reduce breaking down, rather than building up.\n\nIn fact, this is why steroids work so much better at building muscle than growth hormone, which is almost purely \u201canabolic\u201d and has very little anti-catabolic effects.\n\nImproved Hormones Are Key\n\nSo, let\u2019s pause for a moment and let me quickly summarize what we\u2019ve learned so far.\n\nIf you want to build more muscle, get stronger, and also have less belly fat, you want to do TWO things at the same time.\n\nIncrease anabolic hormones\n\nDecrease catabolic hormones\n\nIf using MONEY as an example or an analogy, this means more revenue and fewer expenses and thus, a lot more money and NET profit for you.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nOne additional note as far as the stress hormone cortisol\u2026 It is catabolic to muscle, but it\u2019s also indirectly ANABOLIC to fat cells.\n\nKeeping this super simple, chronically elevated stress hormones such as cortisol will start to cause fat storage and synthesis, while also increasing appetite.\n\nThis is why taking prednisone, basically \u201ccortisol in a pill\u201d, will cause rapid fat gain.\n\nOne example of this is Jerry Lewis. He had been thin his entire life. He had to take prednisone due to an illness he had, lung disease, and he rapidly gained 60 lbs in just a few months.\n\nAnd when he eventually got off this toxic drug, he lost all the weight.\n\nNo change in diet \u2013 it\u2019s just negative hormonal changes and negative food partitioning effects because of cortisol.\n\nMeaning the food you eat gets utilized more for fat storage, rather than energy and protein synthesis.\n\nEffects of High Cortisol\n\nRemember, cortisol is a stress hormone and when it\u2019s high, your body is in SURVIVAL mode and it wants to create fat so you can survive longer in case you can\u2019t find food.\n\nIt\u2019s your body\u2019s natural protective measure.\n\nIt does NOT want to grow muscle because muscle takes up too much energy, it eats up too many calories.\n\nAnd\u2026 as we dig deeper into this topic, this is also why as cortisol increases, testosterone decreases.\n\nThat\u2019s right, the hormone that opposes testosterone is not a female hormone such as estrogen, but the stress hormone, CORTISOL.\n\nJust one night of bad sleep can shoot up cortisol and decrease testosterone.\n\nAfter a week, you can have a decrease in testosterone levels by as much as 50% or more.\n\nAnd something important here about cortisol. It\u2019s your survival hormone.\n\nOne major reason it also lowers testosterone levels is that it wants to DECREASE your sex drive.\n\nIt does NOT want you to procreate and have babies because your body is thinking \u201cwell, something is wrong that he is under so much stress\u2026 maybe food and shelter are lacking. This is NOT the time to have a baby\u201d.\n\nSo the higher cortisol levels, lead to decreased testosterone, lower sex drive and cause poor sperm production, and so forth.\n\nSo, let\u2019s pause again and let\u2019s quickly review what we\u2019ve learned:\n\nTestosterone is anabolic to muscle cells and increases protein synthesis.\n\nCortisol is catabolic to muscle cells and decreases protein synthesis.\n\nTestosterone decreases fat.\n\nCortisol increases fat, especially belly fat.\n\nCortisol basically opposes testosterone. As cortisol goes up, testosterone comes down.\n\nHigher cortisol is also linked to lots of other health problems, such as:\n\nHigh blood sugar and diabetes\n\nMemory and cognitive problems\n\nGut and digestive problems\n\nBut since today\u2019s goal is about building muscle and losing belly fat, I\u2019ll continue on with that focus.\n\nEasy Ways to Improve Hormones\n\nAnd thus, we have two goals.\n\nTo increase testosterone levels and more importantly, decrease elevated cortisol levels.\n\nAnd to accomplish this goal, I\u2019m going to give you the 3 best and easiest ways to do this.\n\nFirst, you must improve your sleep. Getting deeper sleep is the key to improving all of your hormones.\n\nI\u2019m going to do an entire article series about this topic in detail, so make sure to check my blog regularly.\n\nBut my best suggestion is:\n\nTry to get to bed before midnight.\n\nDim the lights around you an hour before bed and turn on your BLUE BLOCKERS on your electronic devices like your phone and computer.\n\nAnd keep to the same sleep time and schedule every night.\n\nAs far as food, you have to eat carbs. Insulin lowers cortisol. So by having carbs, you raise your blood sugar, the insulin goes up, and cortisol comes down.\n\nThis is why people who are on ketogenic diets or do intermittent fasting all have elevated cortisol levels.\n\nSo, the most important time for your carbs is before, during, and after your workouts.\n\nHave healthy carbs, not junk.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ll do an entire article and email series about this in the future.\n\nI make a shake and I have some around my workout. It\u2019s basically 50 grams of protein and carbs.\n\nYou can be low on carbs the rest of the day if you need to.\n\nFinally, take ingredients \u2013 specific herbs and amino acids that lower cortisol levels.\n\nMost of the supplements suck. But I use \u201cStress & Cortisol Relief\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s got clinically proven ingredients and it\u2019s backed by real science.\n\nI take 2 pills immediately after my workouts and I also take 2 pills about an hour before sleep.\n\nIn both blood and saliva tests, my cortisol levels are for sure lower.\n\nMore details about \u201cStress & Cortisol Relief\u201d in this link if you want to give it a try.\n\nIt comes with a one-year guarantee, so you have nothing to worry about or risk.\n\nSo I talked about lots of stuff today.\n\nPLEASE read this article again because as I stated earlier, managing your hormones and especially your stress and cortisol levels, will make dramatic improvements in your ability to:\n\nand just live a longer and healthier life\n\nI care about you and this is why I\u2019ve given you so much information \u2013 you need to be educated about your health so you don\u2019t get ripped off or lied to.\n\nLet\u2019s get healthier together. I\u2019m here to help you.\n\nImportant \"Stress & Cortisol Improving\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for decreasing your stress - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with stress!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve \"healthy stress hormone levels\" with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://uniim1.shutterfly.com/ng/services/mediarender/THISLIFE/003063629170/media/113482120725/small/1510508444/enhance\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4445839/\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110531162142.htm\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26647769/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23941878/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22844441/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18519168/",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness/passion-flower-for-anxiety-worry-pros-cons-warnings/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to discuss Passion Flower. What it is, how it works, the benefits, and side-effects, pros, cons, and warnings\u2026\n\nAnd the best form and how to maximize the positive benefits, while eliminating the negatives.\n\nToday\u2019s topic is for anyone who wants to reduce anxious feelings and worry, improve your mood, feel more confident, decrease nervousness, and stress\u2026 And simply relax the body and mind.\n\nMy Experience With Passion Flower\n\nWhen I was younger, my grandmother would take this liquid herbal syrup called Passiflorine.\n\nShe and my family would use it to relax. It has a calming effect. It\u2019s used for anxious feelings and nervousness.\n\nIt\u2019s also good for unwinding at the end of the day and helping you sleep.\n\nYou can\u2019t get it in America \u2013 but you can in other countries and we\u2019d get it in Tijuana Mexico.\n\nIt worked great, as long as you took the correct dosage. Unfortunately, one side-effect is you can get really tired for many hours if you take too much.\n\nNow, fast forward years later and I\u2019m researching the best herbs and vitamins for reducing anxious feelings, worry, panic attacks, and relaxing the body and mind.\n\nIt was for myself since I had so much going on in my life \u2014 with work, school, relationships, money problems, and feeling unsure about my future.\n\nAnd one day during my research, I ran into this amazing plant called, Passion Flower, also known as Passiflora\u2026 Which is what Passiflorine is derived from.\n\nAnd it reminded me of my childhood and my grandmother.\n\nAnd I mention this story to let you know that Passiflora or Passion Flower, has been safely used for decades\u2026 including decades ago with my grandmother.\n\nBest Forms Of Passion Flower\n\nNow, there are many forms or ways you can consume passionflower.\n\nYou can do so in a liquid, the way my grandmother did. You can do so in a tea. Liquid drops. Dried powder in a pill and finally, extract form in a pill.\n\nThe most potent and effective form is in the extract form in a pill.\n\nYou want a 10:1 extract ratio with 6% Flavonoids as Vitexin and Isovitexin. These are the active ingredients and alkaloids that are doing all the work and causing the benefits.\n\nAny other form and you\u2019re just wasting your time and money. You\u2019ll have to consume so much to get a little bit of the benefits.\n\nSo, it ends up being a waste of money.\n\nAnd it\u2019s much more difficult to measure the correct amount since it\u2019s not a standardized extract.\n\nSide Effects of Passion Flower\n\nPassionflower is fairly safe. However, some general side-effects are:\n\nSo it\u2019s best to try a lower dose at first and see how you feel.\n\nThis is also why I only suggest taking the standardized extract form \u2013 because it\u2019s precise and can be measured correctly every time.\n\nIt won\u2019t change from bottle to bottle. Liquid forms can go rancid. Dried herbs without extracts have no active ingredients.\n\nAlso, go for the extract!\n\nDon\u2019t Try Passion Flower Just Yet!\u2026\n\nWhen it comes to your health, you never want to just use ONE thing.\n\nJust as you don\u2019t only eat broccoli or only fish\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t only use Passion Flower.\n\nUnfortunately, when taking any one ingredient, your body will quickly adapt to it, and thus, you\u2019ll need to continually increase the dose and amount.\n\nAnd as you increase the dose, you increase the negative effects.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s best to take Passion Flower with similar ingredients.\n\nThis way, you can use the lowest dose of each ingredient, but get the maximum benefits due to the specific synergistic effects.\n\nIt\u2019s called, \u201cstacking\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s like 1+1+1 = 5, not 3.\n\nIt also greatly reduces your body from adapting and thus, the positive benefits continue without you having to increase the dose.\n\nThis saves you money and it\u2019s best for your health.\n\nBest Ingredients For Anxious Feelings & Relaxation\n\nIn addition to Passion Flower (10:1 Extract), 3 other clinically proven herbs that work great with it are:\n\nLemon Balm (10:1 extract)\n\nSt John\u2019s Wort (0.3% Hypericin & 2% Hyperforins)\n\nValerian Root (1.2% extract)\n\nI also suggest 3 potent amino acids:\n\nThere\u2019s a special synergy with these ingredients.\n\nOf course, you might be thinking \u201cgeez, I don\u2019t want to take 10-20 pills every day\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you. It\u2019s expensive and time-consuming.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to either and this is why I use ProVanax.\n\nIt\u2019s a 20+ year natural formula that combines all the ingredients I mentioned today, plus specific B vitamins and probiotics \u2014 all designed to help improve your mood, help you relax, and reduce worry.\n\nSo, if you want to reduce anxious feelings, panic attacks, worry, and nervousness. If you want to improve your mood, feel more confident, and more hopeful \u2013 take a look at the ingredients I mentioned today and ProVanax.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how it works for you.\n\nImportant \"Happy & Mood Enhancing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "There is a simple strategy that you can use to reduce anxiety, improve your ability to deal with stress, and boost your confidence, while improving 2 key hormones simultaneously \u2013 all at the same time!\n\nThe best part? It works immediately and only takes two minutes to do.\n\nYour Hormones, Confidence & Stress\n\nRecent research coming out of Harvard University, The University of Oregon, The University of Texas and many other places is revealing that powerful and effective leaders not only share similar mindsets, but also similar hormone levels.\n\nMore specifically, powerful leaders tend to have higher levels of testosterone and lower levels of cortisol, your stress hormone.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t already know, both men and women produce testosterone. However, men produce a much higher level. This higher level of testosterone (in both men and women) leads to increased feelings of confidence and \u201cdrive\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol, leads to decreased anxiety and an improved ability to deal with stress.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Opposite Of Testosterone?\u2026\n\nBy the way, do you know what the opposite of testosterone is?\u2026 Most people will say it\u2019s the female hormone, estrogen \u2013 but it\u2019s not!\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s cortisol. Testosterone opposes cortisol.\n\nAnd in times of high stress, physical and/or emotional, as your cortisol levels go up, your testosterone comes down! This is nature\u2019s way to prevent your from procreating by lowering your sex drive and libido.\n\nThus, if you have optimal levels of higher testosterone and lower cortisol, then you are biologically primed to be more assertive, confident, driven and relaxed. At the same time, you will be less reactive to stress and more likely to handle pressure situations well.\n\nCorrect Hormones = More Cofidence & Less Stress\n\nIn other words, the correct hormone levels can make you feel more confident and less stressed.\n\nAnd for 25+ years I\u2019ve been saying that the way you look and feel, is based on your genetics and hormones. It\u2019s nice to know there\u2019s finally scientific proof for it!\n\nNow, there are lots of ways to improve these hormones:\n\nDiet Exercise Stress management Supplements Body Language!\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to discuss today. ONE simple \u201cpower pose\u201d that will optimize these two hormones in just a few seconds.\n\nAmy Cuddy from Harvard University discovered that a daily 2 minute \u201cpower pose\u201d, increases your testosterone and decreases cortisol instantly, with a 45% improvement in these two hormones.\n\nI\u2019ve kept it simple because I want to keep this article short and give you something useful to implement right now. So the \u201cpower pose\u201d is basically a Superman / Wonder Woman pose\n\nAnd in these pictures, you can see the difference between a HIGH POWER vs a LOWER POWER body language\n\nSomething to note is that not only will YOU feel confident due to the improvements in your hormones, but OTHER people will also see you as confident because you\u2019re SHOWING confidence.\n\nRather than looking down, depressed, shy or weak.\n\nResults & Improvements Based On Clinical Studies\n\nResearchers, looking at hormone tests, discovered that high power poses increased testosterone by 20% and decreased cortisol levels by 25% at the same time. And it only took 2 minutes for the improvements.\n\nSo What Does This Mean For You?\n\nYou can start the day with a \u201cPower Pose\u201d and think about positive things you want to accomplish that day and hope to make a reality.\n\nYou can use it throughout the day\u2026 At work or in your personal life, before important situations \u2014 meetings, social events, a date, etc \u2014 where you want an extra boost in confidence, do a Power Pose.\n\nI know it may sound silly. However, if you\u2019re going to pick some kind of a posture, don\u2019t you think a \u201cconfident\u201d HIGH power posture is better than a \u201cblah\u201d LOW power posture?\u2026\n\nIt only takes a couple minutes. You don\u2019t have to exaggerate it either. Stand up straight, look confident and think confident, positive thoughts.\n\nSMILE and then go kick some butt!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

But THIS is the time you\u2019ll need to put in extra effort to purposely change your mood and seek out things that are positive.\n\nFor example, stop watching the news (which is usually negative) and watch something funny. Seinfeld was always one of my favorites, so is I Love Lucy.\n\nThere are hundreds of funny TV shows \u2013 watch THEM, instead of drama, action, or something that\u2019s not \u201cfunny\u201d.

It is thought to help nourish neurons, while restoring depleted synaptic activity and is one of Ayurveda\u2019s most revered herbs for brain health.\n\nNOTE: Make sure you only use the 50% extract (bacopa glycosides) because this is the most potent and what was used in the clinical studies.\n\nSensoril\u00ae Ashwagandha extract counters some of the oxidative damage generated by nervous tension and stress.10 Clinical trials have shown reduced levels of the stress hormone cortisol, by up to 26% while maintaining normal blood sugar levels and lipid profiles.11 Studies have also shown an improvement in energy, sleep, healthy outlook and well-being, as well as diminished fatigue.12\n\nNOTE: There are many varieties of Ashwagandha Extract. The most potent form, that\u2019s clinically proven and patented is Sensoril\u00ae version. It has the highest extract (32% oligosaccharides, 10% withanolide glycoside conjugates) and the correct ratios.\n\nSharp-PS\u00ae Green Phosphatidylserine (Soy Free) is required for normal cellular structure and function. Brain tissues are especially rich in phosphatidylserine (PS), but aging causes a decline in the PS content of cells throughout the body. Research has shown that in addition to improving neural/brain function, PS enhances energy metabolism in all cells, memory, concentration, learning and word choice.13,14\n\nAnother major benefit to using PS is that it significantly improves cortisol levels, resulting in a more relaxed state.4,1\n\nNOTE:This is one of my favorite ingredients. It\u2019s very powerful. I suggest the \u201csoy free\u201d version and the clinically researched one being Sharp-PS\u00ae\n\nN-Acetyl Tyrosine is an amino acid that can be converted in the brain and in the adrenal glands to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (adrenaline) hormones that are depleted by stress, overwork and certain drugs. By replenishing norepinephrine in the brain, mental energy levels will improve \u2013 as well physical stamina.\n\nNOTE: I suggest using the N-Acetyl version of Tyrosine because it\u2019s more stable and soluble, thus resulting in greater bioavailability and more benefits at a lower dosage.\n\nThe Best Combination That\u2019s Clinically Proven\n\nNow, I don\u2019t recommend you take each of these ingredients individually because it\u2019s time consuming, not convenient and becomes expensive over time.\n\nHowever, the good news is that if you want to increase your energy levels, mood, cognition, memory and physical stamina by optimizing your youthful hormones and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, stress hormones, ATP, and mitochondria, I suggest using one of my favorite all-natural solution called Body-Brain Energy.\n\nNow, I recommend Body-Brain Energy because it already combines these 4 ingredients with other, clinically proven ingredients\u2026. at the correct extract AND dosage amount.\n\nThis is what I personally use for myself, my family, clients, patients and even my professional athletes.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.stress.org/americas-1-health-problem/ Accessed January 7, 2013\n\nComp Biochem Physiol Part D Genomics Proteomics. 2012 Jun;7(2):161-71.\n\nScience. 2010 Dec 3;330(6009):1349-54.\n\nJ Clin Sleep Med. 2007 Dec 15;3(7):681-8\n\nBull Exp Biol Med. 2003 Dec;136(6):585-7.\n\nPhosphatidylserine: Number One Brain Booster.

    "content": "I think most people know that anxiety, depression, worry and sleep problems are often triggered by stress or a stressful event, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2026\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t always control the OUTSIDE world,\u2026 however you certainly can control the INSIDE world \u2013 what goes on inside your head and in your body\u2026\n\nRemember, stress is stress \u2013 but the MEANING you give to any \u201cstressful situation\u201d is ultimately what defines how BADLY the stress affects you, your body and your life.\n\nBelow are some simple steps to help you \u201cmanage\u201d your stress and change how \u201cit\u201d affects you!\n\nTo get you started, here are some helpful tips and suggestions that you can incorporate into your daily routine:\n\nTry to get up a little earlier than usual. This will give you time to ease into your morning routine, as opposed to scrambling to feed the kids, make your way through traffic, and gulp down a cup of coffee before arriving at work. Enjoying a cup of coffee and watching the sunrise or listening to some good music for a few minutes, can have a lasting impact on the rest of your day.\n\nExpect the best, but plan for the \u201cworst\u201d. Plan for eventual mishaps, such as losing your keys. Make extra copies of your house and car keys and place them where you easily find them. This can reduce the stress associated with looking for lost items.\n\nMove more\u2026 \u201cMotion, creates emotion!\u201d Take the stairs instead of the elevator whenever you can. When going short distances, walk or ride your bike instead of driving.\n\nEat healthier. Replace unhealthy food choices with healthier options like ordering salad with lemon juice, or fresh fish and vegetables. When we\u2019re stressed we tend to grab whatever is in front of us, but this can lead to many problems, such as weight gain and health issues.\n\nEat slowly and enjoy your food. Try not to eat lunch at your desk. Instead, find a more relaxing spot if only for a 15 or 20 minute break. Share lunch with friends or co-workers\u2026 Put on some good music (iPod or Smart Phone) and enjoy your food.\n\nGive\u2026 Treat yourself to something nice, like a massage. Alternatively, do something nice for others on a whim. You could bring bagels or muffins to the office one morning, for example \u2013 the response you get can lift your mood, even if only for a few hours.\n\nForgive and forget it (REALLY do it!) Practice forgiveness by not dwelling on something that recently happened. For instance, if someone was rude to you, try not take it personally. Instead, conjure up a memory of someone that was pleasant or neutral. Forgiving the mistakes of others also helps you forgive the mistakes in yourself.\n\nSet limits. Knowing when to say \u201cno\u201d to additional responsibilities reduces the risk of burnout. Instead, put your best effort into your present responsibilities, try to delegate tasks whenever possible, and resist the urge for perfectionism.\n\nStretch at work. Sitting all day behind a desk is just HORRIBLE for your body. Twist side from side to side. Bend forward. Turn your head to stretch your neck. This helps keep your body flexible, giving you an added energy boost. Take a 5 minute break for every hour you work behind your desk.\n\nEnjoy the sun. Get some rays early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Sunlight has a pronounced, calming effect on your mood. Sitting by a window facing the sun for just 10 minutes a day is one great, proven way to lift your spirits.\n\nAs you can see, reducing stress and its effects on your mood and well-being is possible with a few simple tactics.\n\nThey make up the type of lifestyle changes that can have a marked effect on your mood.\n\n\u201cIs There An Easier Way?\u2026\u201d\n\nEven though the above is fairly easy to implement, it does take time for these steps to become a HABIT. Of course, most of us always want an \u201ceasier\u201d way to do things for \u201cfaster\u201d results.\n\nWell, another simple yet extremely effective approach is to use natural ingredients that are proven to help reduce stress.\n\n\u201cWhat About Prescription Drugs?\u201d\n\nPharmaceutical companies are well aware of the fact that natural ingredients DO WORK.\n\nFor example, did you know that Valium\u00ae is made from Valerian Root and Aspirin is made from White Willow Bark?\u2026\n\nHowever, since pharmaceutical companies cannot make money from nature, they find what works in nature, change it, make it \u201csynthetic,\u201d add in a bit of addictive qualities, patent it, charge a massive mark-up to them and create a drug.\n\nNatural Is Better & Safer\n\nAt the very least, natural ingredients and herbs should be your FIRST solution, and in most case, your best solution! One scientifically-proven remedy that has been around for years is ProVanax. It contains many key ingredients which are known to help reduce anxiety, depression, and sleep problems.\n\nThe feedback for it has been amazing and since the product has been around since 1999, you know it works and it\u2019s safe!\n\nAnyways, there\u2019s a very interesting video about how ProVanax\u2122 works, how you\u2019ll benefit, the clinical studies, customer reviews, FAQ\u2019s and more\u2026\n\nCombined with a proper life-style and other suggestions I made today, ProVanax\u2122 can dramatically help improve your results and help reduce the negative emotions, thoughts and overall feelings of stress.\n\nTake a look and let me know what you think!\n\nYES!
