    "content": "Vitamin D is a steroid hormone produced from cholesterol when your skin is exposed to sunlight.\n\nSo if you\u2019re not eating some cholesterol in your diet and/or you\u2019re on a cholesterol-lowering statin drug \u2013 you are most likely deficient in Vitamin D.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s estimated that at least 50% of the US population is deficient in Vitamin D. And what\u2019s worse, closer to 90% have sub-optimal levels.\n\n3 Best Ways To Increase Vitamin D Levels\n\nThe first and primary thing you should do is get more sunlight on your skin. Your skin uses cholesterol to produce Vitamin D.\n\nYou need at least 10-30 minutes daily of midday sunlight. The more skin, the better the production of Vit D.\n\nThe sun is the best way to get Vitamin D. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not convenient and of course, the sunlight leads to skin damage, aging and other health risks.\n\nThe two best sources are fatty fish such as salmon, which is also high in healthy Omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nJust make sure the Salmon is wild-caught and the eggs are from pasture-raised, free-range chickens, which have 4-5x more vitamin D.\n\nUnfortunately, foods have low levels of Vitamin D and it\u2019s very difficult to get adequate doses from foods.\n\nTake Specific Supplements\n\nI personally just tell everyone to take a supplement because most of us simply do not get enough daily sunlight and aren\u2019t consuming salmon and whole eggs daily.\n\nSupplements are the easiest way to get optimal vitamin D \u2013 however, it must be done correctly \u2013 so, read on\u2026\n\nFirst, the correct form is Vitamin D3 \u2013 so read your labels.\n\nNow, one problem with taking Vitamin D is that it can increase calcium levels in your arteries.\n\nYou don\u2019t want this because it can potentially cause a blockage and lead to a heart attack or stroke\u2026 especially if you have high cholesterol, blood pressure, or blood sugar levels.\n\nThus, it\u2019s best to also take Vitamin D3 with another fat-soluble vitamin called K2.\n\nVitamin K2 takes calcium out of the blood and arteries and deposits it into the bones where it belongs.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s a special vegan, a micro-encapsulated form of Vitamin D3 and K2 that\u2019s more absorbable and bioavailable. This means it works better, and this is especially important as we get older and don\u2019t absorb nutrients as well.\n\nI recommend Perfect Vitamin D&K.\n\nIt\u2019s one pill daily, at the max potency dose, and the correct form of both vitamins. It\u2019s simple and easy.\n\nHowever, I still suggest you try to get daily sunlight.\n\nIt may not be enough, but the Sun has many healing benefits and nothing can replace it.\n\nJust make sure to also take one pill daily of Perfect Vitamin D&K and you\u2019re all set!\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

    "content": "If you had to pick one vitamin for promoting a healthy immune system in 2025, what would it be?\n\nFirst, the best \u201cvitamin\u201d I would say is Vitamin D.\n\nBUT, it\u2019s not technically a vitamin, it\u2019s actually a hormone\u2026 And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so powerful!!\n\nHowever, there is a REAL vitamin that I would technically list as #1. But, I want to finish off the Vitamin D topic first because it\u2019s so important\u2026\n\nSimple Facts About Vitamin D\n\nIt\u2019s primarily produced by the sun and UV rays, hitting your skin, interacting with cholesterol, and other factors to help produce vitamin D in your body.\n\nMost people are deficient in Vitamin D. One main reason is due to lack of sunlight.\n\nVitamin D should be taken with Vitamin K, another fat-soluble vitamin. They work together to help absorb calcium into your bones and not into your arteries.\n\nThe correct forms are vitamin D3 and K2 (MK-7)\n\nMicro-encapsulated, plant-based D3 is better absorbed.\n\nAs far as dosages, the ideal and healthy dose is 125 mcg of D3 (5000 units) + 50 mcg of K2. Take this daily, in the morning with food.\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling sick, I actually take 4x this dose for a few days, and immediately I\u2019m feeling well.\n\nIt seems almost overnight my immune system shoots up and kills everything bad in my body.\n\nThe product I use is Perfect Vitamin D&K \u2013 it contains all the right amounts, dosages, etc.\n\nTRUE vitamin for the Immune System\n\nVitamin D is fantastic \u2013 but as stated already, it\u2019s technically not a vitamin.\n\nA true vitamin that I think is best for promoting a healthy immune function is Vitamin C\n\nI take about 3000-5000 mg daily and up to 10,000 when I\u2019m feeling sick or stressed out.\n\nI\u2019ll get much deeper into Vitamin C and the immune system in future articles \u2013 the best form, dosages, when to take it, etc.\n\nMeanwhile \u2013 make sure you keep your Vitamin D&K levels at optimal levels and add in 3-5 grams of Vitamin C daily.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

People and doctors don\u2019t make this a big priority, but I hope you do. You can watch a free video about this topic and how my dad had a stroke recently because of this.\n\nLosing weight is important on so many levels. And if your fat goes to your stomach, then you REALLY need to start considering some kind of healthy weight loss program \u2013 better eating, daily exercising, and supplements to help speed up results.\n\nHealthy cholesterol is one most people are aware of and this is very important. But your HDL/LDL ratios, lower triglycerides, and homocysteine levels are also vital for a healthy heart and in my opinion, even MORE, important than simply having \u201chealthy cholesterol\u201d. I discuss this in a free video\n\nBlood sugar is also very important and one that most people don\u2019t consider when it comes to having a healthy heart. Additionally, elevated glucose and insulin levels corrode the arteries and also cause unhealthy fat gain, especially around the belly. You can watch a free video about this topic.\n\nAnd finally, the most important aspect of a healthy heart and that\u2019s a healthy lifestyle, which consists of the right kind of \u201cdiet\u201d and specific type of exercise that will improve all the above-mentioned criteria, naturally.

    "content": "I get a lot of questions about eggs, which is good because there\u2019s a LOT of misinformation about this wonderful food source.\n\nIt\u2019s easily one of the best sources of complete protein.\n\nIt\u2019s erroneously thought to be bad for you because the media has lied and said how it\u2019s \u201cbad\u201d for your cholesterol levels because it increases it.\n\nHowever, they failed to mention that it increases your \u201cgood\u201d, HDL cholesterol.\n\nEggs are good for your brain, muscles, fat loss, skin, hair, memory, hormones, and sex drive\u2026 just to name a few of the benefits.\n\nAnd with that said, today\u2019s topic is going to reveal the REAL difference between white and brown eggs.\n\nWhat makes the egg brown or white?\n\nIs there a difference in the chicken that laid the egg?\n\nIs one healthier than the other?\n\nWhat makes the shell harder?\n\nWhy are brown eggs more expensive?\n\nDoes one taste better than the other?\n\nDoes the color of the yolk make a difference?\n\nWhich is the best type of egg to eat?\u2026 free range, pasture raised or cage free?\n\nWhat Makes The Egg Brown or White?\n\nThe color of the egg is determined by the breed of chicken.\n\nIn general, white-feathered chickens with white earlobes lay white eggs, and reddish-brown-feathered chickens with red earlobes lay brown eggs.\n\nThere are also breeds that lay less commonly found blue eggs and speckled eggs.\n\nWhich One Is \u201cBetter\u201d For You?\n\nThe truth is it makes no difference.\n\nThe color of the egg does NOT mean it\u2019s healthier for you or that is has a better or different type of nutritional value or even taste different.\n\nUnfortunately, because we\u2019re told that we shouldn\u2019t have \u201cwhite\u201d foods \u2014 white rice, pasta, bread, white sugars, etc., etc. \u2026 brown eggs cost more than white, even though there\u2019s no difference in them.\n\nWhy Do Brown Eggs Cost More?\n\nOther than marketing and the perception that white has less nutritional value\u2026 Brown eggs tend to have a higher price tag simply because the reddish-feathered chickens that lay brown eggs are larger than the breed that lays white eggs, and as such, they require more feed/food.\n\nThat extra cost is offset by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a higher price at the grocery store.\n\nWhat Makes The Shell Harder?\n\nThe shells of both color eggs have the same thickness.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever noticed that an eggshell seems tougher, it\u2019s because of the age of the chicken, and not the color of the egg.\n\nYounger chickens tend to lay eggs with harder shells, while older chicken lay eggs with thinner shells. This is true of both white and brown eggs.\n\nHowever, the harder the shell, the more calcium it typically has.\n\nWhat About The Color Of The Yolk?\n\nHealthier eggs that are fed better food and also live better lives, tend to have darker yolks \u2013 which is better for you.\n\nThere are more nutrients and the egg does taste better.\n\nBut again, this has nothing to do with the color of the eggshell, but rather the feed the chickens eat and the healthier lifestyle they have.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Egg To Eat?\n\nSo, the color of the eggshell doesn\u2019t matter in regards to the quality of the egg \u2013 nor the taste.\n\nIt has to do with the BREED of the chicken.\n\nHowever, the bottom line and probably the most confusing is:\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between free-range, cage-free and pasture-raised eggs? What\u2019s the healthiest?\n\nAnd this DOES make the biggest difference so read the article explaining the differences and which is the best egg and chicken: Free range, cage free, or pasture raised eggs?\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "For the past 3-4 years, my mom\u2019s cholesterol has been between 225 to the highest of 243 (mg/dL).\n\nAccording to the numbers based on what you \u201cshould\u201d have on a blood test, my mom has HIGH cholesterol.\n\nIdeally, you\u2019re *supposed* to have your total cholesterol under 200 and anything over 240 is \u201chigh.\u201d\n\nAnd for those of you who know me, you\u2019re probably shocked that I would ever allow her numbers to get so high \u2013 especially considering I\u2019ve formulated one the most effective, natural cholesterol-improving solutions on the market for the past 20 years \u2013 Cholesterol Optimizer.\n\nOn top of it, why hasn\u2019t her cardiologist prescribed her a statin cholesterol-lowering drug?\n\nWell, this is because her \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol (High-density lipoprotein) is crazy high and off the charts \u2013 averaging around 115 mg/dL.\n\nAccording to the stats, you want your HDL to be over 40 and my mom\u2019s is almost 3x the amount!\n\nAnd because of this, her cardiologist said, \u201cSam, I honestly don\u2019t care at all what her total cholesterol is, with HDL levels that high \u2013 she\u2019s got nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, he\u2019s done all the tests and checked her arteries and everything. Things have only improved and gotten better in the past 20 years.\n\nAnd the reason both her cardiologist and myself have no concern is that the HDL (High-density lipoprotein) is like a vacuum cleaner for cholesterol in the body.\n\nWhen it\u2019s at healthy levels in your blood, it helps remove/reduce extra cholesterol and plaque buildup in your arteries and then sends it to your liver.\n\nYour liver then expels it from your body. Ultimately, this will help reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThis is what keeps your \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol in check.\n\nIt\u2019s the ratio that matters.\n\nAnd the higher your HDL, the better and less concern with your LDL.\n\nSo, with that said, let me give some of the foods my mom eats that have improved her HDL cholesterol from about 50 mg/dL to what it is now, 20 years later \u2013 115 mg/dL.\n\nNOTE: People will get different results. However, any improvement is a step in the right direction, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve changed the type of fats my mom eats.\n\nShe\u2019s almost eliminated all the regular vegetable and seed oils you see at the supermarket \u2013 such as canola, corn, sunflower, soybean and so forth, to eating fats such as:\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nFlaxseed Oil (Udo\u2019s Oil is my favorite)\n\nShe has about 25% \u2013 40% of her diet from these healthy fats.\n\nI\u2019ve actually reduced her protein intake. She has eliminated all dairy \u2013 no milk, cheese, yogurt, etc. She eats:\n\nPasture Raised Bison/Buffalo or Grass-fed beef \u2013 1x weekly\n\nPasture Raised Whole Eggs \u2013 2-3 eggs weekly\n\nPasture Raised Chicken \u2013 1x weekly\n\nVegetable protein powder \u2013 2x weekly (no soy, rice protein isolate)\n\nIt\u2019s not much protein at all, maybe just one meal daily.\n\nThe rest of her protein will come from plant-based food, vegetables, beans, and so forth.\n\nHealthy Carbohydrates\n\nEveryone is afraid of carbs these days, but you shouldn\u2019t be at all.\n\nMy mom has reduced \u201cbad\u201d carbs such as cereals, pastries, pasta, bread, and so forth \u2013 anything that\u2019s packaged, \u201cman-made\u201d, and has a long shelf life, which contains a ton of ingredients.\n\nYou want natural carbs.\n\nWhite or wild rice (her favorite)\n\nBeans and Legumes \u2013 black beans and lentils are her favorite, cooked in a pressure cooker to remove lectins which cause inflammation\n\nFruit \u2013 NO juice, whole fruit\n\nVegetables \u2013 she\u2019s not a fan but will eat some broccoli, carrots, and spinach mainly\n\nAnd that\u2019s it for the diet.\n\nWater, Tea, and Cholesterol Optimizer\n\nShe drinks more water these days, but not as much as she should.\n\nShe loves her tea (Earl Grey and green tea).\n\nOf course, she still takes Cholesterol Optimizer daily.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s increased her dosage as she\u2019s gotten older, which has made additional improvements in her lipid levels:\n\nImproving triglycerides to Healthy levels\n\nHealthy Homocysteine Levels\n\nImproving HDL/LDL ratios dramatically\n\nSupports healthy liver function \u2014 where 80% of your cholesterol is made (NOT from the foods you eat)\n\nImproving inflammation and blood sugar (healthy levels)\n\nNow, I\u2019m not asking you to make all of these changes to your diet \u2013 it took some time with my mom.\n\nI\u2019ve listed the foods you should eat and what to avoid (or reduce).\n\nJust try your best to add some in daily and over the next few weeks and months, you\u2019ll all of a sudden see yourself eating much better without making any real sacrifices.\n\nTry to walk daily as well. The best time is after a meal. Just walking 10-15 minutes after a meal will make big improvements.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to drink more water.\n\nAnd make sure you\u2019re taking Cholesterol Optimizer daily \u2013 it\u2019s just a small veggie pill. Think of it as a \u201cvitamin for your heart\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s the easiest and fastest way of making improvements in your cholesterol levels.

    "content": "Over the years, I\u2019ve dealt with probably thousands of people dealing with cholesterol problems. In fact, back in 1998, the first people I dealt with were my own parents.\n\nThey needed to do a physical for life insurance and they both came back with \u201chigh cholesterol\u201d in their blood test. Immediately, each of their doctors, prescribed my parents a statin, a cholesterol-lowering drug.\n\nTwo different doctors. Two different drugs. But both were prescribed statins.\n\nVarious Negative Side Effects\n\nI wasn\u2019t very knowledgeable at the time and I thought it was a great idea \u2013 a drug that can safely lower cholesterol levels with NO negative side effects.\n\nOf course, that was about 25+ years ago and we didn\u2019t know what we know now.\n\nEven though these drugs are one of the top prescribed drugs in the world for many, many years, they do have a lot of negative effects on people.\n\nWell, that first year of taking these drugs, both my parents started having various negative effects.\n\nMy mom had dry skin, hair loss, joint pain, memory problems, and some other issues.\n\nMy dad had muscle pain, strength loss, liver problems, and also sexual issues.\n\nIs There A Safer Solution?\n\nWell, I decided to get them off the drugs since it\u2019s obviously not going to be a healthy, long-term solution.\n\nAnd I started to do a lot of research to see what the real cause of high cholesterol was and then hopefully find a natural and safe solution or options.\n\nOf course, I immediately looked into the diet. We all know how important a healthy diet is for everything in life. It should be your #1 goal.\n\nHowever, both my parents ate fairly well already. But, I decided to put them on a ZERO cholesterol diet \u2013 that meant no saturated or animal fats.\n\nTheir cholesterol levels did improve, but not nearly what I thought they would.\n\nSo, I did more research and discovered that 80% of your cholesterol is made in your LIVER \u2013 not from the foods you eat.\n\nIn fact, in the old days, our grandparents and great-grandparents ate a ton of fat \u2013 butter, whole milk, whole eggs, and so forth. Yet, cholesterol levels were fine.\n\nOf course, eating fast foods, processed foods, and so forth is always a bad idea \u2013 but my parents didn\u2019t eat that stuff. Everything was natural and wholesome.\n\nSo then I thought, maybe it\u2019s exercise.\n\nHowever, my dad was in very good shape and exercised daily \u2013 so no issues with him.\n\nMy mom didn\u2019t, so I had her walk daily.\n\nAgain I did another set of blood tests, but no real change in cholesterol levels.\n\nOf course, keep in mind that if you are very overweight and don\u2019t move much, that\u2019s just unhealthy in every respect \u2013 not just for your cholesterol levels.\n\nSo far, I had realized that as important as diet and exercise are for everything related to health, it wasn\u2019t a big factor in my parent\u2019s cholesterol problems.\n\nMaybe it was stress? Maybe it was poor sleep?\n\nWell, my dad had more stress due to work, but he slept great.\n\nMy mom had less stress, but she didn\u2019t sleep well.\n\nAnyway, no way I can change a person\u2019s stress levels or sleeping patterns, so I put this aside.\n\nAt this point, I was just very confused and frustrated.\n\nThen I Discovered The Real Cause\n\nI did more research and finally, it hit me \u2013 cholesterol is a HORMONE.\n\nMore specifically, cholesterol belongs to the steroid family of lipid (fat) compounds. It\u2019s a type of fat in your body.\n\nWhile too much cholesterol isn\u2019t a good thing, your body needs cholesterol to run at its best.\n\nCholesterol is the most abundant steroid in the body. Almost every cell in your body and brain, NEEDS cholesterol to function.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to what I said a few seconds ago \u2013 cholesterol is a HORMONE. A steroid is a hormone.\n\nTestosterone, estrogen, cortisol, and so forth are all STEROID HORMONES\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing, as you get older, your hormones start falling apart and becoming unbalanced.\n\nBecause you don\u2019t have optimal youthful hormonal levels, your body can\u2019t metabolize and utilize cholesterol as it used to when you were younger, and thus, cholesterol starts to build up in your body.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m making this very simple because I don\u2019t want this to get too medical and boring. But I think you get the point.\n\nAnd when you think about it, it makes perfect sense.\n\nThis is why younger people eat total junk and yet, they rarely have cholesterol problems because they have good hormonal balance.\n\nAnd what happens when women hit menopause and their hormones crash?\u2026 Yup, all of a sudden they start to have high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and so forth.\n\nSame with men and andropause, which is similar to menopause\u2026 they also start to have cholesterol problems.\n\nBut in men, it\u2019s more gradual, while in women it\u2019s more sudden \u2026 all due to negative hormonal changes due to AGING!\n\nBy the way, guys who take steroids at any age, immediately have bad cholesterol levels and this is because again, their hormones are negatively unbalanced and unnatural. And not in a healthy, youthful range.\n\nSo yes \u2013 lifestyle \u2013 diet, exercise, stress management, and so forth \u2013 are all very important and should never be ignored\n\nHOWEVER, genetics aside, it keeps coming back to the negative hormonal changes due to aging!\n\nSo, What Does All Of This Mean To You?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that now you need to start taking hormones because that\u2019s not natural. And it\u2019s very complicated. And it\u2019s never just ONE hormone \u2013 such as only testosterone for men or estrogen for women.\n\nIt\u2019s all about hormonal balance.\n\nHowever, what you DO need to do is give an \u201caging\u201d or more \u201cmature\u201d body specific nutrients that it needs, due to the lack of optimal hormones, so your body can naturally \u201cheal itself from within\u201d and you can have healthy cholesterol and lipid levels within a normal, youthful range.\n\nAnd, this is exactly what I did for my parents back in 1998.\n\nThe results were really good in fact, so good that they had healthy cholesterol levels within a normal range in about 30 days.\n\nMy dad did get better results than my mom. But over time, my mom\u2019s levels continued to improve.\n\nAnd the formula is basically a few specific and scientifically validated herbs, minerals, and vitamins that help your body metabolize and utilize lipids, to help support healthy cholesterol and triglyceride levels within a normal, youthful range.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how much your cholesterol levels have improved\u2026\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal four main foods that are clinically proven in multiple clinical studies, including a Harvard study1, to improve your heart health which resulted in a decrease of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol by 17%.\n\nNot only did cholesterol levels improve, but additional improvements were seen in:\n\nlowering of triglycerides (which are the most common fat types in the human body)\n\nC-reactive protein (which is a marker of inflammation)\n\nThis was examined in both randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, so they took into account multiple variables.\n\nIn fact, these four foods are so effective that several government organizations have recognized and are utilizing the benefits of this specific diet which includes these foods.\n\nThe best type of diet which includes these 4 food types are \u201cplant-based\u201d diets.\n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t want to go 100% plant-based, that\u2019s fine. You can still reap the benefits by simply adding these 4 food types to your current diet.\n\nHealthy fats in nuts are very healthy, and I think almonds, macadamia, and walnuts are best. Ideally, you would soak them in water for 8 hours before eating, to improve digestion.\n\nThis was from plant proteins obtained either from soy-based foods such as tofu, soy milk, or other soy-based meat substitutes.\n\nAs you may know from previous articles I\u2019m not a fan of soy because it can lower thyroid and testosterone while increasing estrogens.\n\nA better source of plant proteins would be from beans, peas, chickpeas, or lentils.\n\nRemember that you can also have these plant proteins in powder form \u2013 such as pea and rice protein.\n\nThe study used primarily soluble fiber, such as \u201coats, barley, psyllium, eggplant, okra, apples, oranges, and berries\u201d.\n\nCertain foods containing plant sterols can also help lower \u201cbad\u201d, LDL cholesterol.\n\nThese are \u201ccholesterol-like\u201d compounds that can be found in certain fruits, vegetables, nuts, and cereals.\n\nUnfortunately, you\u2019ll have to eat a LOT of these foods to see any positive benefits.\n\nHowever, an easier and more effective method is to simply take supplements containing a combination of BOTH Plant Sterols and Plant Stanols which can help lower cholesterol by 10% to 14%.2\n\nNumerous studies have also shown that 3 additional foods are also very beneficial.\n\nPrimarily when taken in a supplemental \u201cextract\u201d form, which is far more concentrated and effective than the food source:\n\nPolicosanol2 \u2013 which is a natural supplement derived from sugarcane.\n\nArtichoke Leaf Extract3 \u2013 which has numerous studies going back to the early 1930s\n\nRed Yeast Rice Extract5,6 \u2013 which has been safely used in China for over 2000 years\n\nMy Parents & Their Results\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that in 1998, I used a modified version of this diet with my parents to help lower their cholesterol.\n\nThis is because I wanted to get them off of the toxic statin cholesterol-lowering drugs, which had a lot of negative side effects.\n\nThe results were good, but not enough improvements.\n\nBut, we needed more benefits and that\u2019s when I added in the 3 herbal ingredients I mentioned earlier, in addition to a couple more and then they saw a major improvement in only 30 days.\n\nAnd you can get the details of what they used by clicking here!\n\nPlant-based diets have numerous health benefits, especially for your heart.\n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t want to go 100% plant-based, that\u2019s fine. Just make sure your diet also contains some:\n\nAdditional benefits can be seen even faster when adding in:\n\nArtichoke Leaf Extract\n\nRed Yeast Rice Extract\n\nAnd as a reminder, you can see exactly how my parents used this same formula to lower their cholesterol in just 30 days \u2013 naturally. And I got them OFF of the harmful medications as well.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/what-foods-are-included-in-the-portfolio-diet\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14506834.1\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562776.1\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22113535\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20636227\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12881451",

It\u2019s just ONE of many factors.\n\nSadly, doctors immediately try to prescribe you cholesterol-lowering statin drugs even when there\u2019s no need.\n\nHigh AND low cholesterol are both bad for your health.\n\nYour goal is to have healthy cholesterol levels, naturally \u2013 without drugs.\n\nCholesterol is needed for hormone production and every single cell in your body needs cholesterol \u2013 including brain cells.\n\nUnfortunately, many people eat what they think are \u201chealthy foods,\u201d but are actually not good for them and are causing high cholesterol levels.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to reveal 5 foods you should avoid, especially if you want to have healthier cholesterol levels:\n\n1 \u2013 Baked Foods/Carbs\n\nStay away from baked foods like muffins, cakes, bread, donuts, croissants, rolls, cookies, danishes, scones, pies, etc.\n\nAlso stay away from \u201cpackaged\u201d foods such as chips, pretzels, crackers, and similar items.\n\nThese are all bad because they contain hydrogenated and saturated fats, as well as dairy.\n\nNot to mention, they\u2019re high in simple carbohydrates and sugars.\n\nThe combination of fats and sugars in these foods increases cholesterol and plaque buildup even more, in addition to higher triglycerides, inflammation, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure.\n\nALL of these combined are what cause heart problems.\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer that regardless of anything you read, you should stay away from dairy or at least limit it.\n\nThis is because milk is for babies and cow milk is for baby cows.\n\nWe are the only animals who continue to consume milk products after the initial \u201cbaby\u201d stage. It\u2019s NOT \u201cnatural\u201d.\n\nBesides, 99% of dairy products are pasteurized, which kills any benefits milk could have.\n\nNot to mention, the toxins, hormones, and drugs these animals are given are highly concentrated in the milk \u2013 which goes inside of YOU!\n\nThese toxins stress your liver and cause an increase in cholesterol.\n\nRemember, 80% of your cholesterol is made IN YOUR LIVER.\n\nThe saturated fats and \u201cmarble fat\u201d found in meat, pork, poultry, and shellfish can be bad for your health and cholesterol levels.\n\nLimit your intake and focus more on\n\nfish \u2013 especially wild-caught salmon\n\ngrass-feed LEAN meats\n\npasture-raised chicken breast\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a burger, tacos, french fries, pizza, or anything else \u2013 they\u2019re all high in carbohydrates, hydrogenated, saturated, and omega 6 fats, using unhealthy and toxic proteins.\n\nIt may be easy and good for your wallet because they\u2019re cheap foods \u2014 but it\u2019s bad for your health and cholesterol levels and you\u2019ll pay a higher price later in life.\n\nEggs can be good or bad.\n\nAll the cholesterol and fat are located in the egg YOLK, which is why most \u201cexperts\u201d say you should only consume egg whites.\n\nHowever, most of the nutrients, antioxidants, and half the essential amino acids (protein) are also found in the yolk.\n\nThe problem is when you COOK the yolk \u2013 such as hard-boiled, scrambled, and fried eggs.\n\nThe heat oxidizes the egg and damages the structure of the fat.\n\nHowever, the egg yolk can actually increase your \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol and this is done when you eat the yolk that\u2019s still soft and runny.\n\nRaw eggs are great or soft-boiled.\n\nMake sure it\u2019s organic, pastured, free-range eggs.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying to never eat these foods \u2013 but try to limit them or at least be mindful.\n\nThis is exactly what I had to do with my own parents when I got them off the statin drugs and lowered their cholesterol levels, naturally with a proven, herbal/vitamin pill.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today I\u2019m going to discuss the 4 main causes of high cholesterol and also reveal 3 myths that are causing your body to produce even more cholesterol.\n\nBack in 1999 I had to deal with BOTH my parents having \u201chigh cholesterol\u201d.\n\nWe tried different diets, exercise programs, 2 different statin cholesterol drugs, and natural herbal alternatives.\n\nIn the process of \u201cexperimenting\u201d on my parents (sorry mom and dad! =), I discovered the primary causes of high cholesterol and a lot of myths\u2026 which then led to my finding proven, all-natural solutions (which I\u2019ll get into deeper details in a future article).\n\nThis is a very important topic because for many people, having high cholesterol may NOT be your fault!\n\nPrimary Causes Of High Cholesterol\n\nSo obviously you can\u2019t be eating junk and expect to be healthy, let alone have healthy cholesterol levels.\n\nWithout complicating things, I like to tell people to eat as naturally as possible.\n\nThis means you need to avoid and eliminate anything that is \u201cman-made\u201d, comes \u201cin a box\u201d or is \u201cpre-packaged\u201d.\n\nPretend you were living 100 years ago, what would you eat? Or, what would you have access to if you lived on an island? Eat these types of foods, does this make sense?\u2026\n\nOf course, there are 3 important myths I want to quickly discuss that are actually\n\ncausing higher cholesterol levels\n\ndecreasing your overall health\n\nand accelerating the aging process.\n\nMYTH \u2013 Don\u2019t Eat Foods With Cholesterol\n\nThis is so silly. Your body NEEDS cholesterol to make all the different \u201cyouth\u201d hormones.\n\nIF you don\u2019t eat it, your body will produce cholesterol internally, and thus, you end up having HIGHER cholesterol.\n\nIn fact, 80% of your cholesterol is produced internally, by your liver!\u2026 NOT from the foods you eat.\n\nIt might sound crazy, but I eat about half a dozen WHOLE eggs every day and I have normal cholesterol.\n\nGo ahead and have some free-range, pasteurized organic eggs and some grass-fed, free-range Bison.\n\nThey\u2019re GOOD for you and your cholesterol levels.\n\nMYTH \u2013 Eat Whole Grains\n\nResearch is demonstrating the link between inflammation and heart disease.\n\nGrains and sugars contribute to inflammation and increase the risk of heart disease.\n\nConsuming them, especially in excess, has also been linked to other problems like metabolic syndrome, blood sugar problems, obesity, and others.\n\nReduce \u201cwhite\u201d carbohydrates, and grains and eat more vegetables, legumes, some sweet potatoes, and fruit.\n\nMYTH \u2013 Eat Vegetable Oils & Stay Away From Saturated Fats\n\nUgg\u2026 another silly statement made by most \u201cexperts\u201d.\n\nMost of these vegetables, and \u201csupermarket\u201d oils are rancid and have been overly treated to increase their shelf life.\n\nDo NOT eat canola, soybean, corn, etc., oils. Or at least, try to limit them.\n\nA little here and there is fine. But over time, many years later, they will cause health problems.\n\nThese oils mess up the balance of protective Omega-3 fatty acids and potentially dangerous Omega-6 fatty acids in the body.\n\nThey also contribute to inflammation and arterial damage.\n\nThere is no reason that you need to consume these oils at any point\u2026 ever!\n\nAnd don\u2019t ever, never eat margarine. That\u2019s the fakes of all fats. Grass-fed butter is much better for you. Even though I don\u2019t recommend dairy (see below).\n\nInstead have some almonds, walnuts, coconut oil (YES, it\u2019s very good for you), avocados, some fish oils (like Salmon), extra virgin olive oil and organic flaxseeds (keep them refrigerated).\n\nOther Diet Changes To Consider\n\nYou MUST reduce animal protein. Limit dairy.\n\nRemember, milk is for babies and COW milk is for BABY COWS \u2013 got it?!!\n\nNo red meat, other than grass-fed Bison or Beef.\n\nNo bottom-feeder seafood (like crab, shrimp, lobster, etc.).\n\nHave your salmon, it\u2019s very good for you.\n\nAnd get your protein more from vegetable sources or vegetable protein powders.\n\nDon\u2019t get upset, but you need to MOVE MORE! \u2026\n\nWalk daily for at least 20-30 minutes. Anyone can do this and it\u2019s FREE.\n\nLift weights, which is more important than cardiovascular work in my opinion \u2013 WHEN done correctly.\n\nStart low and build up over time.\n\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re \u201chandicapped\u201d, we can all move more \u2013 right?!!\u2026\n\nYou can walk 3x weekly for about 20-30 minutes. And on other days lift weights, even if it\u2019s your own body weight.\n\nBut all you need to do to get started is MOVE more often!\n\nThis is one everyone is going to get upset with, but this is an unfortunate \u201cfact\u201d that almost killed both my parents and actually caused my dad to have a stroke!\n\nYou need to take control of your OWN health.\n\nDoctors just love to quickly prescribe drugs, rarely give the details about natural alternative lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.), and are quick to say how supplements (herbs, vitamins, minerals) don\u2019t work.\n\nAnd I guess I don\u2019t blame them.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no classes in medical school about diet, exercise, supplements, etc. It\u2019s just about drugs and surgery.\n\nTrust me, the RIGHT SUPPLEMENTS DO WORK!!!\n\nFor over 20+ years natural herbs and vitamins have helped thousands of people around to world get off their toxic, harmful drugs\u2026\n\nAnd help create healthy cholesterol levels WITHOUT the negative \u201cdrug\u201d side effects.\n\nYou just need to know WHICH are the best, most effective, safest herbs and vitamins to take.\n\nOkay\u2026 so all the above aside, the biggest factor in the \u201cnegative\u201d change in your cholesterol is genetics and the change in your hormones due to AGING. This is what happened to my parents.\n\nThis is why young people eat junk and still have healthy cholesterol, they just have better hormones.\n\nNOTE: This doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t fix your lifestyle, it just means you need extra assistance\u2026 This is why my parents take natural herbs and vitamins.\n\nEat Better \u2013 fewer grains and sugar, healthier fats, fewer animal products, and more vegetables. Try to eliminate \u201cman-made\u201d, processed foods.\n\nExercise Daily \u2013 walking is a great start, lifting weights (bands, machines, bodyweight, etc.)\n\nNo Drugs \u2013 this is your last resort, not your first (which is what doctors tell you to do).\n\nTake Supplements \u2013 Your body requires specific nutrients that an \u201caging\u201d or more \u201cmature\u201d body needs as we get older.\n\nThere you have it.

In fact, it keeps going higher and higher.\n\nAnd the older you are, the worse the statistics are.\n\nAnd this includes both men AND women!\n\nWhy are things only getting worse, when more and more people are taking these \u201ccholesterol lower drugs\u201d?\n\nWhy aren\u2019t these drugs working to save more lives?\n\nWhat\u2019s the REAL cause of high cholesterol and can you fix it, naturally?\n\nSo to make a long story short, back in 1998 both my parents were prescribed these \u201ctoxic\u201d, statin drugs. During that year they felt so horrible with many side effects\u2026 so I got them off the drugs and really pushed for a natural lifestyle.\n\nThey were already eating well, but I turned it up a notch and got super strict.\n\nMy dad has always exercised, but I increased it with him and added it with my mom.\n\nThe good news is that their cholesterol levels did improve, but not by much. I was surprised actually, I thought they\u2019d get bigger improvements.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when their doctors said \u201cSee, you need to get back on the drugs.\u201d\n\nBut I refused! I had to find a natural solution that was safe and didn\u2019t have negative side effects.\n\nAnd I mention this story because if you\u2019ve had similar challenges yourself and have NOT gotten the results you were hoping for and you\u2019re confused or frustrated \u2013 you\u2019re not alone.\n\nIn fact, this is typical \u2026\n\nThe REAL Cause Of High Cholesterol\n\nInitially (20+ years ago), I was new to the topic of \u201ccholesterol\u201d.\n\nSo, I spent the next few months doing lots of research about cholesterol, its causes and solutions.\n\nOver time, I realized a common denominator \u2026\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I discovered the REAL cause of high cholesterol is the negative change in your hormones, due to aging.\n\nIt happens to women almost instantly, because of menopause\u2026\n\nWhile more gradual with men due to the negative hormonal changes of aging.\n\nAnd this explains why young people in their teens and 20\u2019s \u2026. Eat junk, don\u2019t rest enough or even exercise and yet, their cholesterol levels are still healthy \u2026\n\nThis is because they have good hormone levels, which quickly help eliminate excess cholesterol and more importantly, repair your organs and blood vessels.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, or lose hope and think you can\u2019t fix this because you\u2019re getting older \u2026\n\nI\u2019ll show you in a minute that you can easily and quickly fix your cholesterol problems, naturally \u2026 without drugs, super restrictive diets, or crazy exercise programs.\n\nThe \u201cHigh Cholesterol\u201d Myth\n\nHowever, the other problem with these cholesterol-lowering drugs is that they only focus on \u201clowering cholesterol\u201d.\n\nYou don\u2019t want only that because cholesterol has many benefits.\n\nLow cholesterol can be just as bad as high.\n\nLow cholesterol causes depression, low sex drive, and earlier death.\n\nWhat you want to do is improve all of your lipids and the ratios.\n\nHealthy cholesterol levels within a normal range (not low or high)\n\nOptimized HDL/LDL ratios\n\nLower fatty Triglycerides\n\nHealthy Homocysteine levels\n\nOptimal Lipoprotein (A) & Apolipoprotein B\n\nBlame It On Your Liver\n\nThe next problem with aging is that our livers aren\u2019t as strong as they used to be.\n\nGetting older, taking prescription drugs, alcohol, toxicity in our foods and so forth, all make the liver and kidneys weaker.\n\nAnd most people don\u2019t know, but 80% of your cholesterol is made IN your liver!\u2026 it\u2019s NOT from the foods you eat.\n\nThis is why diet changes don\u2019t usually make a big improvement in most people.\n\nThe problem is INTERNAL!\n\nSo in addition to improving your lipid levels and ratios, you ALSO want to detox, cleanse, repair, and strengthen your liver.\n\nHere\u2019s How To Fix Things\n\nAs I learned more and more, I started implementing all of these changes with my parents.\n\nI basically gave them specific nutrients that an \u201caging\u201d and \u201cmature\u201d body needs, so it can help heal itself from within \u2026 naturally!\n\nRemember, your body is a self-cleaning and self-healing organism \u2026 IF you give it what it requires!\n\nAnd when you do, your body helps fix all the years of \u201cdamage\u201d or \u201cneglect.\u201d\n\nYour hormones will start to improve, you\u2019ll have more energy and feel younger.\n\nBecause I wanted to make all these various lipid improvements, in addition to healthy cholesterol levels, I created an \u201call-in-one\u201d solution for my parents, which they\u2019ve been taking for over 20+ years.\n\nYou may want to give it a try and see how it works for you.\n\nIt\u2019s easy, convenient and doesn\u2019t require drugs, restrictive diets or lots of hard exercises.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.lowestmed.com/top-50-prescription-drugs-filled/\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_heart_disease.htm",

    "content": "For those who have been taking Omega-3 capsules to help lower the risk of heart disease, krill oil has certainly come to light in recent years about being a more effective version. However, does krill oil really lower the amount of cholesterol in the body?\n\nThe answer is a not-so-surprising \u201cyes\u201d as krill oil has proven to be quite effective over standard fish oil in lowering the amount of cholesterol found in the body. Studies with rats demonstrated that while both Omega-3 and krill oil inhibited the enzymes that metabolize the fat in the liver that krill oil was much more effective. In fact, krill oil absorbed up to 15 times the amount that fish oil did by comparison, making it far more effective in terms of preventing cholesterol from being absorbed into the body.\n\nWhy is Krill Oil More Effective?\n\nEven though krill oil and fish oil or Omega-3 is essentially the same thing, it is the molecular composition of krill oil that makes it more effective. This is because fish oil is mostly absorbed into the gut before it can be effective in reducing the cholesterol levels. Krill oil however is not absorbed in that fashion and therefore your body will be able to use virtually all of to prevent cholesterol absorption.\n\nIn addition, krill oil contains a powerful antioxidant which helps protect the integrity of the krill oil itself so that it will not \u201cspoil\u201d like fish oil will in a short period of time. In most cases, less krill oil needs to be taken compared to standard Omega-3 fish oil capsules because of its effectiveness. For many, this means that they only need to take one or two capsules of krill oil to get the effects needed to lower their cholesterol count and do much, much more as well.\n\nThe Benefits of Krill Oil\n\nIn addition to helping the body lower the amount of cholesterol present, krill oil also reduces inflammation which supports the health of the joints in your body as well. For those who enjoy bodybuilding or using weights or resistance exercises, krill oil provides a means that can not only increase your results in terms of muscle building, but also the definition of the muscles as well.\n\nIn addition, krill oil will also help with to regulate the function of the thyroid so that you feel more satiated after you consume a meal. This can lead to great loss of excess fat which will not only help your body building efforts, but also help to lose weight and keep your cholesterol under control.\n\nAthletes often take krill oil to help their bodies do more from increasing the energy that is expended to preventing oxidative damage which may occur. There is a powerful antioxidant in krill oil that actually counteracts the oxidative damage to help keep athletes healthier and performing better over long periods of time.\n\nBasically, krill oil helps your body do a lot of things better from helping you retain lean muscle mass to increasing the efficiency of your metabolism. However, just for the cholesterol-lowering properties alone, krill oil makes for an excellent supplement to the body.\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "For those who struggle with their weight, nearly any product that offers the chance to reach a target weight is a good thing to try. One of the most popular products on the market today is called Glucomannan, but it is more commonly known as Konjac Root. It can contribute to a lower calorie diet and increase the potential of weight loss with daily exercise. How does this supplement actually work? And is it worth the cost?\n\n1000mg of Konjac Root Brings Important Health Benefits\n\nThe initial benefit that comes with Konjac Root is the fact that it is a good source of soluble fiber. This is needed for a healthy diet anyway, but larger amounts of fiber in the diet can help people feel fuller longer and this leads to reduced calorie consumption. Glucomannan also encourages your body to use the good cholesterol it needs in a regulated way while supporting the disposal of bad LDL cholesterol, although it won\u2019t actually work to lower the number you have.\n\nThe reason why this is such an effective supplement is that it can absorb a lot of fluids. Konjac Root can actually hold up to 100x its weight in liquids, which means it will expand in the stomach and really make you feel full after you\u2019ve taken it. It also acts to prevent the stomach from emptying itself too rapidly, which enhances the full feeling and has a positive influence on blood sugar levels and insulin resistance.\n\nThese Actions Do More Than Help People Lose Weight\n\nBecause the metabolism is staying up while digestion is slowing down, Konjac Root helps the body utilize many of the extra resources it has stored over time. Part of that is in the fat resources, but there\u2019s also the cholesterol consumption aspect of this root and the best part is that if it is eaten as a food product, it has virtually no calories. It can be substituted into tofu dishes easily, can be used to create Konjac noodles, and even though it is high in fiber, it can help to ease constipation.\n\nOne of the best aspects of Konjac Root, however, is that it has been used for centuries as a tool to detoxify the body. In traditional Chinese medicine, this root is believed to help reduce and suppress tumors, regulate blood pressure, and loosen thick phlegm that can develop after a viral infection. It\u2019s also been used for weight loss over the centuries because of its low caloric counts, which makes it a great food to incorporate into almost any diet.\n\nWhether you choose to take Konjac Root as a supplement or you prefer to eat it as part of your weight loss goals as a food item, it has the tools to help you achieve your overall fitness goals quickly and efficiently. If you\u2019re ready to take control of your health and start losing weight, this supplement is a great place to start. Test it for yourself to see how effective it can be.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Lowering your levels of LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol will lead to a decreased risk of heart disease. However, achieving that goal of getting your LDL cholesterol range down to normal levels quickly does require using certain methods that go beyond simply losing weight or stopping smoking.\n\nIn fact, getting your weight down to normal levels only has a modest effect on LDL cholesterol levels and that takes time. However, there are ways to lower the level of \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol in your system quickly if you follow your doctor\u2019s advice. What follows are a few different means to actually reduce the amount of LDL cholesterol in your body quickly and safely.\n\nThis is arguably the fasted way to lower your LDL cholesterol, especially if it has reached dangerous levels. There are several types of medications that will have a quick and dramatic effect on the level of bad cholesterol in your blood stream which includes the following:\n\nOf the four, most doctors recommend statins as the medication of choice since it can reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 50% very quickly.\n\nRaising your level of physical activity will result in the lowering the LDL cholesterol and raising the level of HDL or \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol by up to 10%. A good 45-minute walk each day either all at once or a few minutes each hour can do wonders for improving your cholesterol levels in the body. There are other aerobic exercises that work also, but the key is enjoying good physical movement for at least 45 minute each day, five days a week.\n\nFish and fish oil are primary sources for Omega-3 fatty acids which can greatly reduce the amount of LDL cholesterol in your bloodstream. While capsule supplements may be acceptable, getting your Omega-3 from fish such as salmon for example two to three times each week is arguably much better. Omega-3 is also found in canola, soybeans, walnuts, flaxseed, and their oils as well.\n\nWhole grains, fruits and vegetables are loaded with fiber which is a proven way to lower LDL cholesterol levels. This is because the fiber itself soaks up the cholesterol in the system and prevents it from being introduced into the bloodstream. Oats, dried beans and barley are also good sources of fiber as well as any product containing psyllium.\n\nThere are also other methods that can reduce the levels of bad cholesterol in the body, although they may not act as fast as the aforementioned methods. Drinking more green tea, eating more nuts and even the modest consumption of alcohol offers a proven means of lowering the bad cholesterol and raising the good. However, the inherent dangers of alcohol consumption are such that many doctors do not recommend more than one drink per day.\n\nTo find the quickest way to lower LDL levels of cholesterol in your body starts with a visit to your doctor to have the levels checked and setting the goal to lower them as quickly as possible.\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and one of the best-selling and most profitable drugs for over 2 decades are cholesterol-lowering \u201cstatin drugs.\u201d\n\nTechnically speaking, they\u2019re the biggest-selling \u201cclass\u201d of pharmaceutical compounds of ALL time!\n\nIt made multiple pharmaceutical companies BILLIONS of dollars in profits year after year, decade after decade.\n\nThe first \u201ccommercially\u201d available and FDA-approved statin was introduced over 30 years ago (lovastatin 1997) and this was formulated based on a natural substance, that I\u2019ll reveal to you later.\n\nThe most popular ones that you\u2019ve probably heard of are Lipitor (Atorvastatin), Crestor (Rosuvastatin), and Zocor (Simvastatin).\n\nThese drugs work by inhibiting the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme \u2013 a key to the biosynthesis of cholesterol within your body.\n\nOkay\u2026 so that\u2019s it for the boring, medical jargon.\n\nI won\u2019t even talk to you about all the political \u201cjunk\u201d and false clinical studies around these drugs. That\u2019s all in the past and you can do your own research about \u201cStatin Side Effects\u201d if you\u2019d like.\n\nAnd when you do, you\u2019ll also find that these most popular and best-selling drugs ALSO have the most side-effects out of all the drugs as well. I\u2019ll just report to you some of the ones I believe to be the worst:\n\nMuscle pain AND damage.\n\nJust keep in mind that your body, including your HEART, is functional ONLY because of your muscles. Permanent damage to them done by statins means permanent damage to your health, fitness, and longevity.\n\n80% of your cholesterol is made within the liver, NOT from the foods you eat. These drugs go inside your liver, prevent the formation of cholesterol, and in the process, DAMAGE your liver. Keep in mind that the weaker you liver, the weaker your body and EVERY organ in your body. It\u2019s your natural filter of toxins.\n\nElevated Blood Sugar and Type 2 Diabetes\n\nOne of the worst things for each and every problem in your body is high blood sugar and insulin levels. It\u2019s the #1 cause of aging. And, these statin drugs accelerate this process. You do the math!\n\nNeurological Problems\n\nYes, it screws up your mind. Sure, it causes depression, anxiety, panic attacks, worry, etc., etc. But that\u2019s nothing compared to Alzheimer\u2019s, Dementia, memory loss, and other neurological illnesses, right?\n\nI\u2019m not even going to get into arthritis, elevated blood pressure, and probably the WORST problem of all \u2013 hormonal imbalances.\n\nAnd I\u2019m familiar with all of these problems because about 25 years ago, my parents were prescribed statin drugs, by BOTH their doctors at separate doctor visits.\n\nI thought it was odd, but back then, we didn\u2019t know any better.\n\nTo make a long story short, within a few months I noticed all of these negative side-effects and I got them off of these toxic drugs (against their doctor\u2019s advice) and put them on natural alternatives, which is what I\u2019m going to quickly discuss today.\n\nIt took a year to find the best, safest, and most effective combination of natural herbs, extracts, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nHowever, the good news is that it\u2019s been 25+ years and they have healthy cholesterol levels and do not take any drugs and are still alive and healthy.\n\nUnexpected photo of my parents & myself. My dad is 90 and mom is 80 years old in this pic. Fortunately, they take NO medications!\n\nSo let\u2019s get right to it, I\u2019ll make this quick.\n\nFirst, your goal is NOT to have \u201clow\u201d cholesterol. You want to have HEALTHY cholesterol levels.\n\nAdditionally and more importantly, you ALSO want optimal ratios of your HDL (\u201cgood\u201d cholesterol/lipoprotein) and LDL (\u201cbad\u201d cholesterol/lipoprotein).\n\nRemember how I told you the first FDA-approved drug was in 1987 called Lovastatin, based on a NATURAL ingredient?\n\nWell, that\u2019s from Red Yeast Rice, which is a common food in Asia.\n\nThe natural form of this extract, in small doses, has all the positive \u201ccholesterol-lowering\u201d benefits, but without the negatives of the synthetic drugs.\n\nHowever, you MUST get the correct form of Red Yeast Rice, at the proper extract dosage, with the \u201ctoxic\u201d by-product, Citrinin removed.\n\nOther Cholesterol Optimizing Herbs\n\nOther clinically proven, natural herbal extracts that promote health, cholesterol levels, and balanced lipid levels, are:\n\nArtichoke Leaf Extract (15% Chlorogenic Acid, 5% Cynarin)\n\nPhytosterols Complex (40% extract from non-GMO pine tree extract)\n\nGarlic (Extract 5% alliin)\n\nPolicosanol (from Sugar Cane \u2013 Saccharum species)\n\nHere\u2019s something interesting: before doctors were handing out statin drugs like candy, the more efficient and effective way of lowering your cholesterol was by optimizing your thyroid hormones.\n\nNow, instead of taking thyroid drugs, I suggest taking:\n\nGuggulsterone (10% Pure Extract; E and Z)\n\nIodine (Kelp Extract)\n\nAs stated earlier, most people don\u2019t know that 80% of your cholesterol is created within your body, by your liver\u2026 and NOT from the foods you eat.\n\nThis is why many times, the change in your diet doesn\u2019t make dramatic improvements in cholesterol levels.\n\nThus, the stronger your liver, the easier your body will eliminate and detox \u201cexcess cholesterol\u201d from your blood.\n\nThe irony is that ALL drugs, especially statins, cause liver damage and thus, will eventually increase your cholesterol levels. And this is why you keep having to increase the dosage of these drugs.\n\nSo make sure you try to eliminate anything that stresses your liver \u2013 this includes all drugs, including alcohol and caffeine. But, since this is almost impossible for most people, I suggest you take:\n\nMilk Thistle (80% Extract)\n\nNAC (N-Acetyl L-Cysteine) \u2013 which also boosts your immune system.\n\nR+ Alpha Lipoic Acid (r+ ALA) \u2013 which also helps lower your blood sugar.\n\nReduce Homocysteine Levels\n\nAll doctors are so focused on improving cholesterol to help you avoid heart disease, a heart attack or stroke \u2014 that they forget (or don\u2019t KNOW!) about something super important and that\u2019s your Homocysteine Levels.\n\nIn fact, researchers now believe that testing homocysteine levels are over 47% more accurate at predicting heart disease than checking cholesterol.\n\nThe cool part is that you can easily and quickly improve Homocysteine levels by simply taking a specific ratio of certain B-Vitamins:\n\nVitamin B6 (as pyridoxine HCL)\n\nVitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin)\n\nFolate (as 5-Methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF))\n\nVitamin B5 [Pantesin\u00ae d-Pantethine (special form of B5)]\n\nFinally, one of the leading causes of many illnesses and diseases is inflammation. And there are a few ingredients that\u2019ll help reduce it. Three of my favorites are:\n\nTurmeric (95% curcuminoids Extract)\n\nMixed Vit. E \u2013 Tocotrienols (90% Delta &10% Gamma Tocotrienols)\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nOf course, taking all of these natural ingredients is a great idea but obviously time-consuming, inconvenient, and very expensive.\n\nThis is the exact problem I faced with my own parents 25+ years ago when I got them off of statin drugs.\n\nBecause of this, we started using an \u201call-in-one\u201d natural solution that contains all of these ingredients in the correct dosage and form.\n\nAnd the best part is that it\u2019ll cost you about $1 day \u2013 something very affordable, with numerous heart-healthy benefits.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "For those who may be suffering from high cholesterol, there are a number of drugs available that may reduce the amount that is in your system. However, all of these drugs come with some form of complications that makes choosing the right one for your needs very important.\n\nOne of the most popular types are statins which have proven to be one of the best at lowering cholesterol while having some of the fewest drawbacks.\n\nStatins are drugs that block the production of a substance in your body that is responsible for making cholesterol. In addition, statins may actually help your body re-absorb the cholesterol that has built up along the artery walls that prevents further blockages of the blood vessels.\n\nStatins are a part of many medications, including Lipator, Zocor and Crestor to name a few. There are also lower cost, generic versions of these drugs that include statins as well. Quite often, statins are used in combination with other lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet and shedding excess weight in order to become truly effective.\n\nThe length of time that you will need to take statins will depend on just how effective the other, natural methods you have used on your body. In essence, if the only reason that your cholesterol count is down is because of statins, then you\u2019ll be taking them indefinitely.\n\nWhile the effectiveness of statins is considerable, just how safe are they for regular use in the body?\n\nThe Side Effects of Statins\n\nThe truth is that statins are arguably the safest cholesterol-lowering drug on the marketplace in widespread use. While most people can tolerate the effects of statins with relatively few side effects, some may experience the following as the body adjusts to the medications.\n\nThe last is the most common of the side effects and they all tend to fade away over time as the body adjusts to the statins. In rare cases, there have been reported more serious side effects that include the following;\n\nIncrease in Blood Sugar\n\nAll of these side effects are very rare, but they have been reported so you must look out for any warning signs that might come in the early stages of taking statins.\n\nOverall, statins are for the most part the safest cholesterol-lowering drug for most people who use them on a regular basis. They are very effective and work in concert with your efforts to lower your weight, get into shape and eat a healthy diet.\n\nIf you have high cholesterol, a family history of high cholesterol, high blood pressure or lead an inactive lifestyle that is fueled by a poor diet and little in the way of exercise, then you are probably a candidate for taking statins. However, a combination of a healthy diet, exercise and statins will help lower your cholesterol with little risk and much reward for your body.\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "Using Oat Bran Muffins to Lower Cholesterol | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/cholesterol-se/using-oat-bran-muffins-to-lower-cholesterol/",
    "content": "There are certainly many different foods that can actually lower the levels of LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol in your blood stream. One of the most recognized foods is oat bran muffins which have been acknowledged by research over the years as being one of the better foods to lower levels of cholesterol in the blood.\n\nStudies that were released in the early 1990\u2019s demonstrated the value of oat bran muffins and their ability to reduce the levels of cholesterol in the blood. However, oat bran muffins are not perfect and must be consumed in moderation in order to enjoy their full effect.\n\nHow Oat Bran Muffins Work\n\nTraditional muffins are generally high in fat content which actually contributes to raising the levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. This is because muffins use animal products in their creation which has the high amount of saturated fats. When these saturated fats enter the intestines, the body produces bile to digest the fats which also contains the LDL cholesterol. That is why foods high in saturated fats are discouraged from a healthy diet.\n\nWhen properly made, oat bran muffins use a reduced amount of animal products and combine healthier ingredients to reduce the chances of the body generating the bad cholesterol. When eaten with other healthy foods such as oatmeal, the result is that your \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol numbers go down because of the healthier ingredients present.\n\nHow to Prepare Oat Bran Muffins\n\nSince traditional muffins use butter and eggs, you will need to substitute them with choices that do not have nearly as much natural saturated fats and cholesterol. You can use applesauce instead of butter for example on a 1 to 1 basis while using only the egg whites and leaving out the egg yolk. You can then adjust the overall amount that you want to use in both to best suit your tastes.\n\nBy making these changes, the oat bran muffins become much healthier and eliminate the saturated fats and potential for bad cholesterol to be built up in the blood stream. Plus, you should not add butter to the oat bran muffins once they are prepared. Otherwise, you are just adding back the saturated fats and bad cholesterol that you just eliminated.\n\nEven without the animal products, muffins still contain quite a few calories so they should be eaten in moderation. A small oat bran muffin in the morning along with a healthy breakfast of oatmeal, fruits and orange juice will certainly provide the energy needed for the day without adding too many calories. Oat bran muffins that are purchased in the store need to have their ingredients examined, especially the number of calories they have so that people can make the best choice when including them in their diet.\n\nOverall, oat bran muffins when made correctly without animal products are a healthy, cholesterol lowering food that can be a part of the daily diet when consumed in moderation. Augmenting oat bran muffins with fruits, oatmeal and other heart healthy foods can help accentuate their effect.\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "\"YES - I Want Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Click HERE & Continue \u00bb It\u2019s 2025 and today I\u2019m going to reveal the most powerful fruit, clinically proven to promote healthy cholesterol in only 7 days.2\n\nNow if you\u2019ve been reading my articles, you\u2019d know that I\u2019m not a big fan of fruit because of the sugar content.\n\nThis is because the fructose sugar in fruits can actually increase your blood pressure, triglycerides and cholesterol levels, while also increasing your risk for blood sugar problems.\n\nAll bad for your heart and brain\n\nAnyway, if fruit isn\u2019t really that good for your health \u2013 then why am I promoting \u201cfruit\u201d in today\u2019s topic?\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s The Miracle Fruit?\n\nWell, the fruit I\u2019m referring to is an Avocado!\n\nNow, most people call an avocado a \u201cvegetable\u201d because it\u2019s green. Or a \u201cfat\u201d because the primary calories are from fat.\n\nHowever, the avocado is technically a fruit, and even more specifically, a single-seeded berry.\n\nPersonally, I categorize an avocado under FATS because one medium-size avocado (150 grams) has about1:\n\n12 calories (3 grams) from protein\n\n12 calories (3 grams + 9 grams fiber) from carbohydrates\n\n216 of calories (24 grams) being from fat (90% of the calories)\n\nNow, the TYPE of fat is the key to avocado\u2019s \u201ccholesterol-lowering\u201d secret.\n\nAs far as clinical proof for supporting healthy cholesterol\u2026\n\nOne study2 saw a 16% decrease in total cholesterol after only 7 days of a diet high in monounsaturated fats from avocados and a 22% decrease in both the \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, along with an 11% increase the \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol.\n\nIn a second study3, the participants saw an average drop of 14 points in \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol with a higher avocado diet\n\nThe \u201cSecret\u201d Heart-Healthy Fat\n\nNow, the reason for avocados working so well is that 66% of the fat is from monounsaturated fats!1\n\nMost people like olive oil as the main source of monounsaturated fats.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t because most olive oil is rancid and processed. It\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nMost of the healthier, \u201cextra virgin oils\u201d break down at a lower heat temperature, and thus, it\u2019s best kept UNCOOKED and eaten raw (like on a salad for example)\n\nMy favorite monounsaturated fat to cook with is macadamia oil because it\u2019s not processed very much and also has a high heat capacity, so it\u2019s great for cooking.4\n\nSo if you want a healthy heart and cholesterol levels, decrease your sugars and increase healthy monounsaturated fats from my favorite heart-healthy fruit, an avocado!\n\nIf you want to speed up the process and want a natural vitamin pill that promotes healthy cholesterol levels, you can also try Cholesterol Optimizer. It\u2019s what my parents have been using for 25+ years.\n\nIt\u2019s natural. Works quickly.

And make sure it\u2019s organic free-range eggs.\n\n5) Baked Foods/Carbs (Snacks Too)\n\nBaked foods such as muffins, cakes, bread, donuts, croissants, rolls, cookies, danishes, scones, pie, etc\u2026\n\nThe types of foods most people eat in the morning when they\u2019re in a rush, or with their coffee or at work as a snack\u2026\n\nThese are all bad because they contain hydrogenated and saturated fats, as well as dairy.\n\nNot to mention, they\u2019re high in simple carbohydrates and sugars.\n\n\u201cBad\u201d fats increase cholesterol.\n\n\u201cBad\u201d fats + carbs/sugar REALLY increase your cholesterol and lead to numerous health issues.\n\nThe combination is super unhealthy.\n\nUnder this same category \u2014 \u201cSnack Foods\u201d such as chips, pretzels, crackers, and similar items are almost as bad as these baked foods.\n\nIt probably feels like you can\u2019t eat anything.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the best-tasting and \u201cconvenient\u201d foods are the most unhealthy for us.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to completely eliminate these foods\u2026\n\nHowever, you should limit them or at least be mindful of the negativity, if you\u2019re goal is healthy heart and cholesterol levels.\n\nFor many, taking specific vitamins & herbs to promote healthy cholesterol levels is the easiest and most convenient solution.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

First, cholesterol is NOT \u201cbad\u201d.\n\nCholesterol is very important in the creation of cell walls, hormones, and digestive juices.\n\nCholesterol is also needed to improve your mood and a positive sense of well-being.\n\nThis is why cholesterol-lowering statin drugs have so many negative side effects because they lower cholesterol too low.\n\nIn fact, having \u201clow\u201d cholesterol levels can be just as bad as having \u201chigh\u201d cholesterol.\n\nYour HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is considered the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol because it can help decrease the cholesterol buildup in the walls of your arteries, which causes the narrowing of their openings.\n\nWhile LDL (low-density lipoprotein), is considered the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol because when your LDL level is high, it can start to form a plaque-like substance on the walls of your cardiovascular system (arteries and veins), blocking the natural flow of blood and leaving you at severe risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe \u201cgood\u201d HDL basically helps clean up your \u201cbad\u201d LDL\n\nGenerally speaking, the higher your HDL, the better.\n\nAn easy way to remember this is to think of the \u201cL\u201d in LDL as LOW and the \u201cH\u201d in HDL as HIGH \u2013 thus, your goal is to have lower LDL and higher HDL.\n\nFor example, after giving my mom some specific herbs, I was able to raise her \u201cgood\u201d HDL from 52 mg/dL to 94 mg/dL.\n\nHer cardiologist and I are very happy because sometimes my mom\u2019s TOTAL cholesterol goes in the \u201cborderline high\u201d range (200-239 mg/dL).\n\nHowever, we\u2019re okay with that because her \u201cgood\u201d HDL is so high and thus, very protective.

And I\u2019ll also reveal the BEST and only type of egg you should be eating.\n\nI\u2019m Paying More, So It Must Be Better\n\nWhen I was having the conversation with one of my fitness friends, he said \u201cI only get cage free, it costs more, but it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s better for the chicken, the environment and it\u2019s a healthier egg as well.\u201d\n\nAnd I said to him, \u201cyeah, that\u2019s what THEY want you to believe \u2013 but this isn\u2019t the case. It\u2019s not even close!\u201d\n\nThis simply means that the chickens are not in \u201cboxed cases\u201d. However, they\u2019re still confined in very small and closed off quarters inside a building. They get no sunlight or access to the outdoors. Their days are spent without any movement, standing in their own filth.\n\nAccording to the USDA regulation, \u201cfree range\u201d only means that the chickens are allowed \u201caccess\u201d to the outside with no specifications as the quality or the duration of that outside exposure.\n\nIn this situation, the chickens are still crammed in large warehouses. However, there is a small door on one end that opens to a few feet of outside dirt space.\n\nBut the sad truth is that the chickens never even know that door exists and couldn\u2019t get there even if they wanted to.\n\nVegetarian Fed \u2013 Bad!\n\nThis is a newer term that is appearing on egg cartons. People read it and think, \u201cWow. The chickens must be fed healthy vegetables and grains.\u201d Ummm\u2026no.\n\nA chicken is a natural carnivore. It eats on flesh. It also likes to eat bugs and insects. It is NOT a vegetarian.\n\nA \u201cvegetarian raised\u201d chicken is completely raised on industrialized feed (probably GMO) and is never allowed outside. EVER! This is actually the WORST form of egg.\n\nPasture Raised \u2013 This Is It!\n\nSo, this is the type of eggs I eat, including animal protein.\n\nAlthough it does not have any current regulations, it is being used by sustainable farmers to mean chickens raised in the outdoors\u2026 in the pasture.\n\nThus, this is what you actually think about \u2013 chickens outside, doing their own thing in nature. This is what you want to buy if you are shopping for eggs.\n\nAnd yes, this does cost more \u2013 but it\u2019s well worth it.\n\nAnother thing to remember is that all of these other ones I mentioned today \u2013 \u201ccage free\u201d, \u201cfree range\u201d, \u201cvegetarian\u201d and so forth \u2013 well, you\u2019re paying way more for the LABEL, even though the egg is not any healthier.\n\nSo either get the cheapest eggs you can find if you don\u2019t care \u2026. or only get Pasture Raised.\n\nEverything else is a scam and a waste of money.\n\nHowever, I want you to remember that when you eat something, you\u2019re eating what IT ate too. If the animal ate unnatural foods for its species, GMO sources and so forth, it changes the hormones and structure of the animal and protein and thus, you\u2019re getting junk.\n\nThis is true for vegetables, carbohydrates, fruits, and fats, and ALL foods.\n\nIf you put bad fuel in your car, it\u2019s not going to run optimally and it\u2019ll cause things to break down much faster.\n\nSo try your best to put the \u201cbest fuel\u201d in YOUR body \u2013 eat as close to natural as possible.",

    "content": "I received a question the other day from Brandon asking:\n\n\u201cI read that eating fiber is good for your health, especially cholesterol. Unfortunately, after about a month of having more fiber, I didn\u2019t see much of an improvement in my cholesterol levels. Should I stop having the fiber or is there a special type of fiber for cholesterol or is this just another big fat lie?\u2026 Please help, I don\u2019t want to waste my money and time.\u201d\n\nWell, this is hard for me to answer accurately in regards to Brandon\u2019s situation because:\n\nI don\u2019t know what his before and after blood tests were\u2026\n\nHow much fiber he was having daily\u2026\n\nWhat kind of fiber he was having\u2026\n\nFirst of all, fiber is good and most people don\u2019t get enough fiber. It\u2019s good for your overall health, cholesterol and lipid levels, weight loss, blood sugar, and colon health, just to name a few benefits.\n\nHowever, how much fiber you eat daily matters, as does the type of fiber.\n\nNatural (found in foods) vs supplements\n\nAnd thus, if you are consuming the wrong kinds, in the wrong ratios and amounts, then yes \u2013 fiber can be a waste of time and money. In fact, it can even be bad for your health due to the irritation it can cause your colon\u2026 in addition to causing gas, bloating, and indigestion.\n\nHowever, generally speaking \u2013 I suggest most people add more fiber to their diets.

    "content": "If you do a search online about \u201cfoods that lower cholesterol\u201d, you\u2019ll typically find the same generic recommendations by most \u201cexperts\u201d\u2026. but not today.\n\nI\u2019m going to reveal the BEST foods that not only help improve your cholesterol naturally but also improve your overall health\u2026 which will help you look and feel younger!\n\nI\u2019ll also quickly discuss some cholesterol myths and give you one of the best methods for quickly and naturally lowering your cholesterol levels.\n\nYou should have some fiber with all your meals because fiber binds to \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol1 and helps lower it. Soluble fiber also reduces the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. You should aim for a minimum of 10 grams of fiber daily, preferably 25 grams.\n\nSo here are the best fiber sources for lowering cholesterol and improving your overall health:\n\nBeans \u2013 black, kidney, lima, lentils and pinto beans have a great source of soluble fiber. They\u2019re also high in protein and don\u2019t raise your blood sugar much, which is also very important for lowering your cholesterol.\n\nVegetables \u2013 you can never go wrong with vegetables. The greener the better. Broccoli, collard greens, spinach, Brussels Sprouts and artichokes are some of the best for fiber and improving cholesterol.\n\nFruits \u2013 apples and pears are very good, especially with the skin because of the pectin. Raspberries are one of the highest, at 8 grams of fiber per cup.\n\nNuts \u2013 they also have good fiber, with almonds and walnuts being the best. But walnuts are also high in omega-3 fatty acids, just like fish\u2026 Which also helps lower \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol further.\n\nThe right fats are very important for overall health because they help optimize all your hormones, which help control your cholesterol.\n\nNow, even though other \u201cexperts\u201d say to have polyunsaturated fats such as sesame, soybean, canola, corn, sunflower and similar \u201csuper-market\u201d fats. I\u2019m totally against these fats because they are very processed and BAD for your overall health and cause inflammation.1,5\n\nIn fact, studies have shown they can actually INCREASE your risk for heart disease.5\n\nMy suggestion is to stick to natural fats such as:\n\nraw nuts \u2013 almonds and walnuts are best\n\nfish oils such as salmon and krill\n\nextra virgin organic coconut oil \u2013 YES, I know others say not to \u2013 but this oil increases your \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol and improves your thyroid, which further helps lower cholesterol\n\nMost Americans eat way too much protein. My suggestion is to eat LESS animal protein. It\u2019s better to stick with vegetable sources and mainly wild caught fish, such as salmon.\n\nSimilar to protein, people eat way too many carbohydrates, which increases insulin levels causing higher \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.1\n\nTry to stay away from grains and have more vegetables, fruits, sweet potatoes and organic, gluten free \u201csteel-cut\u201d oats, which lowers cholesterol better than regular \u201crolled\u201d oats.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s best to eat foods that are NOT packaged. Try to keep things as natural and fresh as possible.\n\nDid you know that heart disease is the #1 killer2, killing more people each year than ALL the other diseases COMBINED?!!2\n\nSo, having healthy cholesterol levels within a normal range is very important... but it's just ONE factor out of many, when it comes to heart health.\n\nYou also need to have healthy HDL/LDL ratios, triglycerides, homocysteine and other lipid levels within a normal, youthful range.\n\nManaging your lipid profiles is probably one of the most important aspects to health, fitness & longevity.\n\nUnfortunately, it can sometimes get confusing or you might feel overwhelmed with too much information \u2014 what to DO or NOT do.\n\nPlus, making dramatic lifestyle changes \u2014 such as eating much better, eliminating lots of different foods and exercising daily \u2014 is very important. But for many people, it can be difficult to start and it takes a longer time to see results.\n\nAnd taking prescription drugs is never a good long-term solution because of all the negative side-effects3...\n\nNow, I'm very familiar with this topic because these are all the same challenges I ran into with both my parents back in 1999.\n\nMost Popular Option: Faster Results & Easier To Start\n\nBecause of this, I wanted a solution for my parents that was safe, worked quickly and was easy.\n\nSo I created a simple, very effective and scientifically researched \"all-in-one\" natural remedy called Cholesterol Optimizer... which is a small pill that helps to naturally:\n\nSupport healthy cholesterol levels within a normal, youthful range.4\n\nHealthy HDL/LDL ratios.4\n\nSupport healthy triglycerides & Homocysteine levels.4\n\nPromote healthy liver function (where 80% of cholesterol is produced).4\n\nOne major reason Cholesterol Optimizer \u2122 is better than other options is because its doctor formulated and scientifically researched to work.\n\nThe feedback has been amazing ... and since the product has been around since 1999, you know it works and it's effective!\n\nAnyways, don't take my word for it. Take a look for yourself -- ingredients, reviews, etc. -- and make your own educated decision. Let me know how it works for you...\n\nEffectiveness of altering serum cholesterol levels without drugs\n\nSide Effects of Cholesterol-Lowering Statin Drugs\n\nCholesterol-Lowering Abilities of a Novel Proprietary Preparation \u2013 CholesLo\n\nDietary fats and coronary heart disease.",

    "content": "There is a lot of beauty that surrounds life in the far northern and southern parts of the planet. Unique landscapes, beautiful mountains, and incredible interactions with wildlife are just the start of the pleasures that these environments provide people who live there every day. The hidden and often not talked about issue of living to the far north or south is that seasonal depression can quickly kick in during the winter months and leave people completely debilitated.\n\nWithout sunlight or with greatly reduced daylight hours, many people can become depressed simply because of the outdoor environment that surrounds them. If daylight is the issue, could sun lamps help treat those who suffer from seasonal depression?\n\nCan Sun Lamps Be Used As a Light Box?\n\nOne of the first treatments that doctors will talk about for someone who suffers from seasonal depression is a light box. Light boxes can be used to mimic outdoor light with an installed sun lamp. With just 30 minutes of therapy each morning, life can get back to normal pretty quickly! You might also be prescribed a specific light box depending on what your health insurance may or may not cover. They can also be purchased over the counter and many have different features that may or may not be beneficial.\n\nWhen looking at sun lamps, it is important to get one that works with light therapy for emotional needs instead of other needs. Some sun lamps are designed to treat skin conditions, for example, and so they\u2019ll emit more ultraviolet light that could damage your eyes. Some sun lamps also burn at different wattage\u2019s, which means you may need more or less time for your therapy session based on the quality of the lamp being used.\n\nShould You Purchase an LED Sun Lamp?\n\nDepending on your community, the tradition incandescent sun lamp may be illegal at the time of this writing. A typical variant would be to utilize a fluorescent bulb instead of the incandescent, but fluorescent bulbs can sometimes trigger migraines in people who are sensitive to them. For that reason, LED sun lamps make for a wise investment, even if they do tend to cost a little more. The added benefit of an LED lamp is that the light frequencies can be better tuned to meet specific needs.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the ability to sit still for 30 minutes or so to benefit from light therapy, then there are some portable sun lamps that are available that work just as well. One of the most unique lamps is a tiny one that clips to the bill of a baseball cap or a visor. You simply shine the light on your face as you go about your day and you get to experience all of the benefits of this light therapy for seasonal depression.\n\nWhen the seasons change, your personality shouldn\u2019t have to change with it. By using sun lamps, light boxes, and other forms of light therapy, you can get the help you need to feel like yourself whether it\u2019s the depths of winter or the peak of summer. It\u2019s easy to use, affordable, and is proven to work.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's natural, easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can achieve your \"mood enhancing\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "title": "Soy Milk Pros and Cons | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health-se/soy-milk-pros-and-cons/",
    "content": "There is little doubt about the popularity of soy milk which is the most well-known of all dairy alternatives to cow\u2019s milk. There are a number of positive ingredients and attributes to soy\u2019s milk which include vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fiber which has helped garner it a very positive reputation. However, is drinking soy milk right for you?\n\nAlthough loaded with a tremendous number of positives, there are still some concerns about soy milk that you will want to take into account.\n\nHealthy for Your Heart: Arguably the most notable benefit in drinking soy milk is how it positively affects the cardiovascular system. Soy milk has no cholesterol and is loaded with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids that have shown to be quite beneficial when it comes to reducing the chances of heart disease. Drinking soy milk on a regular basis can improve the high density lipoproteins (HDL) in the blood which reduces the risks of stroke and heart attacks.\n\nPostmenopausal Hormone Therapy: One of the more interesting effects of soy milk is how it mimics the functions of estrogen in women. For postmenopausal women who suffer from a lack of estrogen, the phytoestogen in soy milk may help balance out the hormones and reduce many of the side effects that come with this condition. For many women who are undergoing this time in their lives, soy milk offers a safe, healthy and inexpensive alternative to hormone therapy. However, it cannot address women who suffer from severe side effects where a physician will be needed.\n\nPrevent Prostate Cancer: Studies have shown that regularly drinking soy milk may lower the testosterone levels in the blood and thus lower the risk of contracting prostate cancer.\n\nThere are a number of negative factors to take into account before you start drinking soy milk. Although many of these deficits are mild in nature, they can have an effect.\n\nAllergy: If you are allergic to soy, then you will be allergic to soy milk which may cause swelling, vomiting, diarrhea and hives. In the most severe cases, you may suffer from anaphylactic shock which means a trip to the hospital.\n\nHigher Risk of Breast Cancer: There have been studies showing that soy milk may increase the risk of breast cancer, although it must be noted that other studies have shown this risk to be reduced.

    "content": "How bad is the typical American diet? The American Medical Association recently recommended that virtually everyone begin taking statins as a proactive measure to reduce the risks of heart disease development because of the foods that people are eating. With cholesterol levels going out of control in the US and around the world, finding ways to lower those levels in an affordable way becomes a priority.\n\nThat\u2019s why many people are turning to Benecol. Through a series of products that include smart chews and butter substitutes, heart health is becoming a priority for many once again. How can this one product help to lower cholesterol levels?\n\nIt\u2019s All About the Plant Stanol Esters\n\nYour body needs cholesterol to make a lot of things, including the essential hormones that help to give you energy and keep you focused every day. What Benecol does is block the absorption of cholesterol through the digestive system, which naturally lowers bad cholesterol levels because that\u2019s how the LDL bad stuff is typically put into your body. The Plant Stanol Esters has over 60 scientific studies supporting its use, so it isn\u2019t just another multi-level marketing scheme.\n\nIt works to increase the strength of the intestinal wall that would normally absorb foods and convert them into glucose and other needed fuel in the blood stream. It won\u2019t completely block everything, but it will greatly reduce the LDL cholesterol because it forces it through the intestinal tract and then out as waste. Best of all, it can begin working in as little as 2 weeks and it won\u2019t interfere with statins that you might already be using.\n\nLifestyle Changes Aren\u2019t Always Enough To Control Cholesterol\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to begin managing your bad cholesterol levels, assuming your heart is still beating and you\u2019re breathing while reading this article! Many people can control their cholesterol levels effectively with just a few lifestyle changes that include a little extra exercise, a better nutritional profile, or just a little less stress. Fruits, vegetables, and lean meats can all lower bad cholesterol levels\u2026 but it isn\u2019t always enough.\n\nThat\u2019s why Benecol is such an effective product to add to your lifestyle. Not only is it proven to work, but if you eat just one smart chew at meal time, for example, you\u2019ll get a full month\u2019s supply of Benecol products for less than the cost of eating out with the family. The one issue people may face in this product, however, is with an allergy they may have. Benecol contains both dairy and soy ingredients.\n\nIf you want to manage your cholesterol levels without the help of medication, then Benecol is the only over-the-counter solution that can do just that. It\u2019s affordable and effective and can begin working right away to control the bad cholesterol numbers that could be putting your health at risk. Why not try it for yourself today?\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/cholesterol/the-truth-behind-liver-health-hormones-lipid-levels/",
    "content": "Your liver is an amazing organ and one of the largest in your body. Even though, it\u2019s classified as a \u201cgland\u201d. It\u2019s the only organ that can regenerate.\n\nIt carries out over 500 essential tasks. However, some of the primary ones that you and I may care about are:\n\nFilters the blood: The liver filters and removes compounds from the body, including hormones and toxins from outside the body like alcohol and other drugs.\n\nDetoxes: It also takes up toxic substances and converts them into harmless substances or make sure they are released from the body.\n\nHelps metabolize proteins, carbs, and fats: It converts the nutrients in our diets into substances that the body can use, stores these nutrients, and supplies cells with them when needed.\n\nVitamin and mineral storage: The liver stores and releases fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K, as well as copper and B12. It keeps significant amounts of these vitamins stored. In some cases, several years\u2019 worth of vitamins is held as a backup. The liver also stores iron from hemoglobin in the form of ferritin, ready to make new red blood cells.\n\nThe bottom line is that the healthier your liver, the healthier your body will function.\n\nIn fact, poor liver function:\n\nincreases blood pressure, which will then stress your kidneys.\n\ndecreases proper hormonal production and conversions (testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, GH, IGF, insulin, etc.)\n\nincreases cholesterol and lipid levels because over 80% of your cholesterol is made in your liver, NOT from the foods you eat. When your liver is healthy, it can get rid of excess cholesterol.\n\nThe truth is, an unhealthy liver leads to a lot of other aging problems, including inflammation, pain, fatigue, wrinkles, hair loss, and so forth.\n\nSo, a healthy liver is extremely important, as you can imagine.\n\nDifferent Forms Of Liver Diseases\n\nAn organ as complex as the liver can experience a range of problems. A healthy liver functions very efficiently. However, in a diseased or malfunctioning liver, the consequences can be dangerous or even fatal.\n\nExamples of some common liver diseases include:\n\nHepatitis: Hepatitis is the name given to a general infection of the liver, and viruses, toxins, or an autoimmune response can cause it. It is characterized by an inflamed liver. In many cases, the liver can heal itself, but liver failure can occur in severe cases.\n\nAlcoholic liver disease: Drinking too much alcohol over long periods of time can cause liver damage. It is the most common cause of cirrhosis in the world.\n\nFatty liver disease: This usually occurs alongside obesity and/or alcohol abuse. In fatty liver disease, vacuoles of fat build up in the liver cells. If it is not caused by alcohol abuse, the condition is called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\nIt is usually caused by genetics, medications, or a diet high in fructose sugar. It is the most common liver disorder in developed countries and has been associated with insulin resistance, which can lead to serious blood sugar problems.\n\nPrevent, Reverse & Fix An Unhealthy Liver\n\nSo, there are lots of things you can do to help fix your liver and get it healthier or keep it as healthy as possible for many years.\n\nEliminate or Reduce Drugs \u2013 This is probably the biggest cause of major liver problems in my opinion \u2013 DRUGS. This includes street drugs (cocaine, etc.), prescription drugs (the massive cause), and over-the-counter drugs (alcohol, pharmaceutical OTC).\n\nDiet \u2013 You also need to eat better food. Again, everyone knows this. But two major causes of liver stress are unhealthy fats in your diet. This includes hydrogenated and trans fats, any vegetable and seed oils that are high in omega-6 fats.\n\nIn fact, some people just don\u2019t do well with high-fat diets. I\u2019ve seen it over and over again with Ketogenic diets. The person may look and feel better, but their liver enzymes go up and so does their lipid and cholesterol levels.\n\nAnd remember, the two go hand in hand. Weak liver causes an increase in cholesterol. The extra fat in the diet is stressing the liver\u2026 so on and so forth.\n\nThe other type of food you should avoid is fructose, more specifically High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS). If you want to have some fruit, great. Just have a whole fruit and not fruit juice.\n\nSo, reducing or eliminating drugs, a diet high in unhealthy fats and fructose will help reduce liver stress.\n\nSupplements \u2013 next thing you want to do is take some supplements to help cleanse, repair, and strengthen your liver. This is something I\u2019ve been doing for at least 2 decades. There are lots of supplements, herbs, and so forth that claim to cleanse the liver. I\u2019ve tested most of them. I\u2019ve looked at blood tests.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you the best \u2013 the ones that will give you the most benefits and thus, save you money and time, by giving you faster results.\n\nMilk Thistle (80% extract): 300-600 mg daily. Very specific for most forms of liver problems.\n\nNAC (N-Acetyl L-Cysteine): 600-1200 mg daily. Helps boost your immune system as well.\n\nAlpha Lipoic Acid: 300-600 mg daily. Take it with food. It also, helps with blood sugar.\n\nTurmeric (Curcumin 95% extract): 500-1000 mg daily. Very powerful anti-inflammatory as well.\n\nIn fact, these 4 ingredients support healthy cholesterol levels, HDL/LDL ratios, Triglycerides, Homocysteine levels, and a couple of other benefits.\n\nI\u2019ve addressed the 5 primary causes of high cholesterol, one of them being liver health. And these 4 ingredients are in the product at the correct dosages and ratios.\n\nIf you or someone you know wants healthy cholesterol, naturally and without drugs \u2013 read this article.\n\nHowever, if your cholesterol is in a healthy range and you simply want to help cleanse your liver, then I suggest you use at least 1 if not all of the 4 ingredients I just mentioned. IF you do use them all together, you can use a lower dosage of each, since there will be an additive and synergistic positive effect.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget \u2014 you should also try to limit liver stressors \u2014 such as drugs, alcohol, unhealthy fats, and fructose.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "While there are many advertisements about foods or medications to lower your LDL cholesterol, it is also very important to raise your HDL cholesterol as well. HDL cholesterol helps to break up formations that may develop in your arteries which keeps your blood flowing and your circulatory system functioning properly.\n\nThere are ways to build up your HDL cholesterol naturally through eating the right foods and exercising. By doing a little each day to boost your HDL cholesterol, you help improve your overall health and well being while decreasing the effects of LDL cholesterol as well.\n\nHDL Cholesterol-Boosting Foods\n\nThere are a number of foods that will help boost your natural HDL cholesterol levels. Generally speaking, these foods are high in mono and polyunsaturated fats which are the kind that actually help your HDL levels.\n\nFish: Mackerel, Salmon and Tuna \u2013 These are known as \u201coily\u201d fish and contain high amounts of poly-unsaturated fats which include Omega-3. This particularly of fat is very helpful in boosting your levels of HDL cholesterol.\n\nNuts: Almonds, Cashew, Sunflower, & Walnuts \u2013 Nuts are generally high in mono and polyunsaturated fats as well. Even peanut butter has polyunsaturated fats, although it also has other qualities that are not as desirable, so it should be consumed in moderate amounts.\n\nOils: Canola, Olive and Sunflower \u2013 These are good cooking oils that will add much needed mono and polyunsaturated fats to your meals.\n\nIn addition, reducing your weight so that you reach normal levels and get rid of the excess fat is a very important factor in helping you increase your HDL levels as well. The foods mentioned above can help you achieve your goals if consumed in moderate amounts along with lean meats, fruits and vegetables.\n\nOf note, the moderate consumption of alcohol also provides a means to raise HDL cholesterol as well. However, the consumption must be of relatively low amounts on a daily basis which means that drinking larger amounts is actually counterproductive when it comes to your health. One or two glasses of red wine and even having a can or bottle of beer may actually improve your HDL levels.\n\nConsistent cardiovascular exercise has been shown to raise HDL cholesterol while also reducing the LDL levels as well. You can engage in weight training which has shown to be quite effective in raising HDL levels, although aerobic exercises will also have the same effect.\n\nHowever, the most dramatic changes are when you combine eating a healthy diet which includes HDL cholesterol boosting foods with regular exercise. The combination leads to a significant lowering of the LDL cholesterol while the HDL is raised considerably as well.\n\nBy combining what you eat with good exercise you can raise your HDL levels considerably over time and help reduce the chances of heart disease. Weight or resistance training which builds the muscles needs to be augmented by eating enough protein to build the muscles while adding the right foods that actually help increase your HDL cholesterol levels.\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Personally, I consider avocado FAT, because the majority of its calories are from fat.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started with the benefits:\n\nHeart-Healthy Fat \u2013 the type of fat in an avocado, is monounsaturated, primarily, oleic acid. It reduces fatty blood triglycerides, lowers \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, and increases \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol. If you are concerned about your cholesterol levels, check my favorite natural solution for improving cholesterol.\n\nGreat Source of Fiber \u2013 avocado contains significant amounts of both soluble (feeding gut bacteria) and insoluble (promoting bowel health) fiber. Most people don\u2019t get enough fiber \u2013 I like natural solutions to increase fiber intake, which will also help you feel fuller.\n\nHealthy Blood Sugar \u2013 avocado has a low glycemic index which means it won\u2019t cause blood sugar spikes \u2013 so it\u2019s good for your blood sugar levels. One of the greatest things you must do for health, fitness, and longevity \u2013 is to improve your blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.\n\n#1 Reason To Avoid Avocados\n\nThere\u2019s one main reason you may want to avoid eating avocados \u2013 that\u2019s the fact that it is high in calories.\n\nPlus, it does taste good, so people end up eating a lot of it. And at the end of the day, total calories still matter \u2013 regardless of macronutrients, food source, or how healthy it is. So, just be mindful of this important fact.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23558164\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16484595\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17545695\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10721886\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12097685\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1308699\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8987188\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24279738",

I would say Olives and Avocados.\n\nNow, there are other sources high in monounsaturated fats and some have more \u2013 such as almonds, cashews, peanuts, and pistachios for example.\n\nHowever, these nuts can have allergic reactions in many people, so they aren\u2019t the safest.\n\nOlives and Avocados are very safe and they are technically a FRUIT because they have a seed.\n\nHowever, I personally categorize them as fats, since the majority of the calories are from fats.\n\nBest Way To Have Your Fats\n\nWhen it comes to consumption, it\u2019s always better to eat the actual FOOD, rather than processed oil. Thus, olives instead of olive oil, and avocados instead of avocado oil.\n\nThe whole fruit has other benefits, nutrients, fiber, etc.\n\nHowever, I personally do NOT like how olives taste \u2013 so in this case, I would have extra virgin olive oil.\n\nNow, avocados are different \u2013 I like how they taste and I think most people do, so I would just have that as a whole food and NOT Avocado oil.\n\nAs far as cooking with them, both can withstand heat well, avocado oil is better. However, I would suggest that you do NOT heat these fats \u2013 eat them at room temperature.\n\nAnd keep in mind that they are fats and thus, dense and high in calories.\n\nWe all need some healthy fats in our diets and monounsaturated are one of the best the two best sources I\u2019ve found are fruits \u2013 olives and avocados.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7555486\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11673773\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2628682/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9497173\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19818442\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3546618/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16287956\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8105097\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9437377\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9926294\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11317662\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403584\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9989963\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15383514",

    "content": "About 3-4 years ago, my dad\u2019s memory was getting really bad and he was complaining about it often. It\u2019s odd because my dad has a really good memory \u2013 unlike me.\n\nNow, the last time he complained about being forgetful, was when he was taking statin cholesterol-lowering drugs back in 1998. So that was a long time ago.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I got him off the drugs and got him and my mom on a natural solution for cholesterol. The great news is that his memory went back to normal again and both my parent\u2019s cholesterol has stayed in a healthy range the entire time.\n\nSince then, he rarely complained about being forgetful or having memory problems\u2026. And then it started again about 4 years ago.\n\nAt first, he just blamed it on being \u201cold\u201d, since he\u2019s in his mid 80\u2019s.\n\nBut the problem was that he was suddenly complaining about being forgetful all the time. It came on fast, it wasn\u2019t gradual.\n\nWe were actually worried that he might have more serious memory problems because his mom had it and thus, he has a genetic/family history of it.\n\nI then asked him if he was on any new medications and he said \u201cyou know I don\u2019t take anything unless I first ask you. However, my doctor did want me to take a blood pressure-lowering drug a few months ago, but I refused and said I\u2019ll fix it naturally like I did my cholesterol\u201d\n\nThen I thought I WAS having memory problems because I don\u2019t remember any of this\u2026 and then I asked my dad if he had ever told me about this?\n\nHe said \u201cno, I didn\u2019t want to bother you. This is just a part of the aging, son.\u201d\n\nI then told him \u201cDad, you\u2019re never bothering me and for something like this, you HAVE to tell me immediately when it happens.\u201d\n\nAnd dad was right \u2026 Memory problems are a part of aging,\u2026 and so is having blood pressure problems. In fact, aging is one of the primary factors of heart problems.\n\nAnyway, I proceeded to tell my dad how blood pressure is, of course, a major cause of heart problems, something he was already worried about.\n\nBut what most people don\u2019t know, including doctors \u2026 is that bad blood pressure is ALSO linked to memory loss and being forgetful. In fact, having bad blood pressure midlife, starting around the age of 35 \u2013 is linked to \u201cmemory decline and lowered thinking skills\u201d later in life, in your 60s and beyond.\n\nAnd this was reported in JAMA Neurology1, based on a clinical study of nearly 13,500 men and women between the age of 45-65, for more than 20 years.\n\nSo, it\u2019s a very accurate and well-documented study.\n\nSadly, taking BNset of side effects, some of them ironically being \u201cmemory loss.\u201d\n\nSo if you want to avoid heart problems\u2026 and you don\u2019t want to have memory problems now or later in life, make sure you support healthy blood pressure today!\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1891344",

    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from Debbie and she asks\n\n\u201cCan you please explain and simplify the cholesterol numbers and charts?\u201d\n\nThis is a good question because I think we should all know more about how our body works because nobody will care more about your health than you will.\n\nFirst, we have your \u201cTotal Cholesterol\u201d numbers, which is the sum of all the cholesterol in your blood.\n\nAs you can see from the chart, your goal should be less than 200mg/dL\n\nHowever, I\u2019d like to point out that I personally believe that anything less than 150mg/dL is TOO LOW!\n\nAnd yes, your cholesterol can be \u201ctoo low\u201d and I think that\u2019s just as bad as \u201ctoo high\u201d, which is over 240mg/dL.\n\nWhat most people don\u2019t know or understand, is that your body NEEDS cholesterol and it has many important functions, such as:\n\nProducing your \u201csex hormones\u201d, such as testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, DHEA, and similar \u201cyouth\u201d hormones\n\nUtilizing Vitamin D and other fat-soluble vitamins, which helps your bones, nerves, metabolism, skin elasticity, strong immunity, and so forth.\n\nProper brain function, memory, cognition, balancing dopamine, serotonin, and other \u201cfeel good\u201d neurotransmitters.\n\nAnd this is a major problem with cholesterol-lowering drugs and why they cause:\n\nIn a minute I\u2019ll show you how you can easily support healthy cholesterol levels naturally, WITHOUT the use of these harmful drugs or a restrictive diet.\n\nHowever, what I\u2019d like to point out is that what matters most is the CORRECT BALANCE in your lipid levels, which is what I want to talk about next and that\u2019s your HDL/LDL ratios\u2026\n\nHDL (Good) Cholesterol Level Chart\n\nFirst I\u2019d like to start with your HDL, which is short for \u201chigh-density lipoprotein\u201d.\n\nYour HDL is considered the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol because it can help decrease the cholesterol buildup in the walls of your arteries, which causes narrowing of their openings.\n\nGenerally speaking, the higher your HDL, the better.\n\nFor example, after giving my mom some specific herbs that I\u2019ll tell you about in a minute, I was able to raise her \u201cgood\u201d HDL from 52 mg/dL to 94 mg/dL\n\nHer cardiologist and I are very happy because sometimes my mom\u2019s TOTAL cholesterol goes in the \u201cborderline high\u201d range (200-239 mg/dL).\n\nHowever, we\u2019re okay with that because her \u201cgood\u201d HDL is so high and thus, very protective.\n\nLDL (Bad) Cholesterol Level Chart\n\nLastly, I\u2019d like to finish with your LDL, which is short for \u201clow-density lipoprotein\u201d.\n\nYour LDL is considered the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol because the risk of heart disease goes up if you have high levels of LDL. So you want this to be LOW\n\nThis is basically the OPPOSITE of what HDL does.\n\nRemember, your goal is to have healthy cholesterol levels in the range of 150-200 mg/dL.\n\nToo LOW is just as bad as too HIGH.\n\nAnd what matters most with your cholesterol numbers is your HDL/LDL ratios.\n\nYou want your \u201cgood\u201d HDL to be high and \u201cbad\u201d LDL to be low.\n\nA good way to remember this is the \u201cH\u201d in HDL for HIGH and \u201cL\u201d in LDL for LOW.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "If you didn\u2019t know, heart disease has been the #1 killer for about 100 years.\n\nCholesterol is a contributing factor \u2013 as is bad blood pressure and sugar levels, as well as inflammation and various other factors.\n\nHowever, high and low levels of cholesterol are both linked to health problems. Especially high LDL.\n\nThe Most Common Cause Of Cholesterol Problems\n\nGenetics plays a big role in everything. However, only a small percentage of people have genetic hypercholesterolemia.\n\nNow, these people for sure should be taking cholesterol-lower medications. In fact, that\u2019s what these powerful drugs were originally developed for \u2013 these specific rare genetic groups.\n\nWe also have the rare few who always have low cholesterol, no matter what.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll assume you and I don\u2019t fall into these extreme categories.\n\nThis is where most experts and doctors will say that lifestyle is a major cause of cholesterol problems.\n\nYes, very true \u2013 but, that\u2019s so vague and generic.\n\nYou can blame lifestyle factors on everything because there are so many factors.\n\nDiet, exercise, stress management, sleep, nutrient absorption, and so on and so forth.\n\nThat\u2019s like you are changing your entire life.\n\nMost people don\u2019t or can\u2019t do all of this. So, they end up doing nothing and things only get worse.\n\nThe Older, Worse The Problem\u2026\n\nBut why is it that the older we get, the worst the cholesterol problems?\u2026 Regardless of your lifestyle changes or improvements?\n\nWhy is it that young people, teenagers, and people in their 20s, who eat junk, party, get drunk and don\u2019t take care of their bodies, and don\u2019t sleep enough, rarely have cholesterol problems?\n\nWhy is it that when women hit menopause, all of a sudden they have high cholesterol?\n\nWell, there\u2019s one common denominator and cause to all of this and that\u2019s the negative changes in your hormones due to aging.\n\nYes, as I\u2019ve stated so many times before \u2013 genetics aside, your hormones control so much of how you look, feel and perform \u2013 internally and externally.\n\nYouthful hormones can quickly fix problems in your body. They speed up repair. They get rid of toxins. They allow for better nutrient absorption, which is super important.\n\nBut, you might also be thinking \u2013 \u201cwell, I can\u2019t get younger and all my hormones aren\u2019t going to change back to their youthful levels \u2013 so now what\u201d?\n\nAnd this is the same problem I ran into with my parents over 20 years ago.\n\nBy the way, they DID improve their lifestyle and their cholesterol levels did improve, but not by much it was a lot of sacrifices and it got expensive.\n\nAnd they eventually did take cholesterol-lowering drugs \u2013 but they had lots of negative side effects, which we all know about now, but didn\u2019t 20 years ago.\n\nSo, What\u2019s The Solution?\u2026\n\nWhat ultimately worked, is when I gave my parents the specific nutrients that aging or more \u201cmature\u201d body needs.\n\nThis way, your body can naturally heal itself from WITHIN because it now has the correct \u201ctools\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve listed the nutrients and solutions for you, and you can get them now, and start helping your body to heal.\n\nAgain, this is all done naturally, and NO change in diet or exercise plan.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "If you do a search online about \u201cfoods for healthy cholesterol\u201d, you\u2019ll typically find the same generic recommendations by most \u201cexperts\u201d\u2026. but not today.\n\nI\u2019m going to reveal the BEST foods that not only support healthy cholesterol naturally but also improve your overall health\u2026 which will help you look and feel younger!\n\nI\u2019ll also quickly discuss some cholesterol myths.\n\nYou should have some fiber with all your meals because fiber binds to \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol1 and helps lower it. Soluble fiber also reduces the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. You should aim for a minimum of 10 grams of fiber daily, preferably 25 grams.\n\nSo here are the best fiber sources for lowering cholesterol and improving your overall health:\n\nBeans \u2013 black, kidney, lima, lentils and pinto beans have a great source of soluble fiber. They\u2019re also high in protein and don\u2019t raise your blood sugar much, which is also very important for healthy cholesterol.\n\nVegetables \u2013 you can never go wrong with vegetables. The greener the better. Broccoli, collard greens, spinach, Brussels Sprouts and artichokes are some of the best for fiber and healthy cholesterol\n\nFruits \u2013 apples and pears are very good, especially with the skin because of the pectin. Raspberries are one of the highest, at 8 grams of fiber per cup.\n\nNuts \u2013 they also have good fiber, with almonds and walnuts being the best. But walnuts are also high in omega-3 fatty acids, just like fish\u2026\n\nThe right fats are very important for overall health because they help optimize all your hormones.\n\nNow, even though other \u201cexperts\u201d say to have polyunsaturated fats such as sesame, soybean, canola, corn, sunflower and similar \u201csuper-market\u201d fats. I\u2019m totally against these fats because they are very processed and BAD for your overall health and cause inflammation.1,5\n\nIn fact, studies have shown they can actually INCREASE your risk for heart disease.5\n\nMy suggestion is to stick to natural fats such as:\n\nraw nuts \u2013 almonds and walnuts are best\n\nfish oils such as salmon and krill\n\nextra virgin organic coconut oil \u2013 YES, I know others say not to \u2013 but this oil increases your \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol and improves your thyroid, which further helps to have healthy cholesterol.\n\nMost Americans eat way too much protein. My suggestion is to eat LESS animal protein. It\u2019s better to stick with vegetable sources and mainly wild-caught fish, such as salmon.\n\nSimilar to protein, people eat way too many carbohydrates, which increases insulin levels causing higher \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.1\n\nTry to stay away from grains and have more vegetables, fruits, sweet potatoes, and organic, gluten-free \u201csteel-cut\u201d oats, which help healthy cholesterol more than regular \u201crolled\u201d oats.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s best to eat foods that are NOT packaged. Try to keep things as natural and fresh as possible.\n\nDid you know that heart disease is the #1 killer2, killing more people each year than ALL the other diseases COMBINED?!!2\n\nSo, having healthy cholesterol levels within a normal range is very important... but it's just ONE factor out of many, when it comes to heart health.\n\nYou also need to have healthy HDL/LDL ratios, triglycerides, homocysteine and other lipid levels within a normal, youthful range.\n\nManaging your lipid profiles is probably one of the most important aspects to health, fitness & longevity.\n\nUnfortunately, it can sometimes get confusing or you might feel overwhelmed with too much information \u2014 what to DO or NOT do.\n\nPlus, making dramatic lifestyle changes \u2014 such as eating much better, eliminating lots of different foods and exercising daily \u2014 is very important. But for many people, it can be difficult to start and it takes a longer time to see results.\n\nAnd taking prescription drugs is never a good long-term solution because of all the negative side-effects3...\n\nNow, I'm very familiar with this topic because these are all the same challenges I ran into with both my parents back in 1999.\n\nMost Popular Option: Faster Results & Easier To Start\n\nBecause of this, I wanted a solution for my parents that was safe, worked quickly and was easy.\n\nSo I created a simple, very effective and scientifically researched \"all-in-one\" natural remedy called Cholesterol Optimizer... which is a small pill that helps to naturally:\n\nSupport healthy cholesterol levels within a normal, youthful range.4\n\nHealthy HDL/LDL ratios.4\n\nSupport healthy triglycerides & Homocysteine levels.4\n\nPromote healthy liver function (where 80% of cholesterol is produced).4\n\nOne major reason Cholesterol Optimizer \u2122 is better than other options is because its doctor formulated and scientifically researched to work.\n\nThe feedback has been amazing ... and since the product has been around since 1999, you know it works and it's effective!\n\nAnyways, don't take my word for it. Take a look for yourself -- ingredients, reviews, etc. -- and make your own educated decision. Let me know how it works for you...\n\nEffectiveness of altering serum cholesterol levels without drugs\n\nSide Effects of Cholesterol-Lowering Statin Drugs\n\nCholesterol-Lowering Abilities of a Novel Proprietary Preparation \u2013 CholesLo\n\nDietary fats and coronary heart disease.",

So, LDL is needed for a healthy body.\n\nUnfortunately, LDL is also known as the \u201cBad Cholesterol\u201d because when your LDL level is high, it can start to form a plaque-like substance on the walls of your cardiovascular system (arteries and veins), blocking the natural flow of blood and leaving you at severe risk for a heart attack and stroke As seen in this chart\u2026\n\nYour goal is to have \u201clower\u201d LDL levels, which is the OPPOSITE of HDL (high-density lipoprotein)\u2026 and I\u2019ll cover HDL in a different article.\n\nAn easy way to remember this is to think of the \u201cL\u201d in LDL as LOW and the \u201cH\u201d in HDL as HIGH And thus your goal is to have lower LDL and higher HDL.\n\nHow To Improve Your \u201cBad\u2019 LDL Cholesterol\n\nA proper diet and exercise will help improve your LDL levels\u2026. And I\u2019ll discuss these two topics in detail in a different article.

But most people are doing the WRONG things to support healthy cholesterol levels And this is why most of us aren\u2019t getting the positive results we expect we\u2019re frustrated with the lack of results and sadly, we give up and take harmful medications.\n\nI know this because this is exactly the problems I ran into with lowering my parent\u2019s cholesterol, levels back in 1998.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today\u2019s question is from Beth and she asks:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got these yellowish patches around my eyelids. My doctor said it\u2019s something called Xanthelasma. I looked online and it\u2019s basically \u201ccholesterol deposits\u201d, correct?\u2026 What\u2019s the cause and how can I fix it because they look really ugly!!!\u201d\n\nHey Beth \u2026 yes, the correct medical term is called \u201cXanthelasma\u201d and it\u2019s basically cholesterol under your skin.\n\nAnd I\u2019m familiar with this topic because my aunt\u2019s husband used to get them and in a minute I\u2019ll share with you how he permanently fixed it.\n\nThe good news is that Xanthelasma isn\u2019t physically harmful, but yeah\u2026 they don\u2019t look \u201cgood\u201d either.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s typically a sign that you\u2019re at a higher risk for heart disease.\n\nWhy & Who Gets Xanthelasma\n\nAnd this is because people who get these \u201ccholesterol deposits\u201d, typically have high levels of cholesterol and an imbalance in their lipid levels.\n\nThese bad cholesterol cause blockage in some oil glands underneath the skin and results in hard little \u201cpimples\u201d (Xanthelasma), which cannot be squeezed.\n\nAdditionally, elevated liver enzymes or liver disease, cause an increase in cholesterol leading to Xanthelasma.\n\nHow To Fix & Treat It\n\nUnfortunately, these cholesterol deposits usually won\u2019t go away on their own and typically will GROW over time. One way to fix it is to go to your doctor and have them removed with topical medicine, laser or surgery.\n\nUnfortunately, they can cause side effects such as scars and skin color changes.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t prevent FUTURE growth or regrowth, especially due to your genetics and high cholesterol levels.\n\nI mention this because as stated earlier, my aunt\u2019s husband used to have Xanthelasma, and even though we improved his diet, it didn\u2019t fix this problem initially.\n\nAnd taking cholesterol-lowering drugs actually made things even worse due to the liver stress and toxicity.\n\nSo, here\u2019s how we finally got rid of the Xanthelasma. Before doing anything medical, I wanted to FIRST see if we can decrease the size of these cholesterol deposits.\n\nThis way, there will be less potential for scarring.\n\nI made sure his diet was healthier. I removed all alcohol because of the liver stress and reduced any processed foods and sugars.\n\nHe was already walking 2-3x weekly, but I had him increase it to daily walks\n\nI increased his water intake, which basically meant going from only 1-2 glasses to 4-6 cups daily.\n\nI had him take high dosages of specific herbs and vitamins to support healthy cholesterol levels and bad lipids. While also cleansing and detoxing his liver.\n\nAfter 6 months, the size of these deposits was about \u00bd the size, which was great. But, they never got smaller.\n\nHe then went to his dermatologist and used the laser to remove what was left. Since they were smaller, there was no scarring.\n\nAnd because of his cleaner diet and continued use of supplements, his cholesterol remained in a healthy range. Another important benefit is that his liver is healthier as well.\n\nAnd the best part is that these cholesterol deposits have NEVER come back and it\u2019s been over 6 years.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://cholesterolguardian.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cholesterol-deposits-around-eyes-naturally\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/eye-health/xanthelasma\n\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/news/2011/09September/Pages/eyelid-marks-heart-risk.aspx",

    "content": "The other day, I took my mom to see her cardiologist for a regular checkup.\n\nHe\u2019s a smart doctor and a great heart surgeon. He doesn\u2019t like prescribing medications unless in rare situations where his patients have tried everything and their cholesterol levels are still above 300.\n\nAnyway, we talked about a bunch of things about heart health, what the newest research is saying, and so forth. I\u2019ll tell you more about them in future articles as well as simple and proven ways of avoiding a heart attack or stroke.\n\nKeto Diets = Higher Cholesterol?\n\nThe subject I want to quickly talk about is ketogenic diets and how they cause high cholesterol. I bring this up because my mom\u2019s doctor was saying, \u201clooks like the high fat, the ketogenic diet is becoming popular again like it was 10-15 years ago with Dr. Atkins.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cYeah, like all fad diets, they come full circle every few years.\u201d\n\nHe continued and said, \u201cI\u2019m getting a ton of patients whose cholesterol levels have dramatically shot up ever since they started these high fat, ketogenic diets. I tell them to get off these diets or else I\u2019m going to have to put them on a statin drug and I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nBut For Some, It Lowers Cholesterol?!!\n\nThe weird part is that for some people, these high-fat, ketogenic diets actually help lower cholesterol.\n\nBut, there is a higher percentage than their cholesterol levels really go up \u2013 especially the longer they follow these days.\n\nWHY Cholesterol Levels Go Up\n\nAnd, there are a variety of reasons for this.\n\nEating WRONG Fats \u2013 One main reason is they eat a lot of bad fats. They have too much saturated and animal fats (butter, etc.). They need to lower these fats and replace them with monounsaturated fats such as macadamia nut and extra virgin olive oil.\n\nNot DIGESTING Fats \u2013 The other problem is that many people do NOT digest fats very well due to their genetics and metabolic type. This puts a lot of extra stress on your liver.\n\nA Liver Issue \u2013 And if you\u2019ve read my previous articles, you recall that 80% of your cholesterol is produced in your liver \u2013 NOT from the foods you eat. Of course, as we age, negative changes in your hormones, toxins, medications, etc. all put stress on the liver and it\u2019s just not as strong as it used to be. This is why your body has a harder time getting rid of excess cholesterol. So, make sure you take liver cleansing herbs such as Milk Thistle, NAC and rALA.\n\nLower Thyroid \u2013 Another problem is that no-carb ketogenic diets reduce thyroid production and slow your metabolism. This further reduces your body\u2019s ability to get rid of excess cholesterol \u2013 especially with the extra stress of the high fat diet. The slower your metabolism, the slower your body can heal and cleanse itself. So, make sure you take an herb such as Guggulsterones, which increases your thyroid to optimal levels.\n\nLess Exercise \u2013 Also, people who follow no-carb diets don\u2019t exercise very much. They don\u2019t lift weights to build muscle. Mainly because it\u2019s hard to exercise when you have no carbs in your diet. Your brain can run on either glucose OR ketones \u2013 but your muscles need glucose. Well, the lack of exercise and muscle loss further slows your metabolism.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re concerned about your cholesterol levels or if you have a family history of high cholesterol or heart disease, I would suggest you do NOT follow a no-carb, ketogenic diet.\n\nTry LOWER, Not \u201cNO\u201d Carbs\n\nYou can follow a lower-carb diet, and have some healthy fats, lots of fiber, vegetables, and some protein.\n\nAnd make sure you do some form of exercise daily \u2013 walking is a great start.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to drink plenty of water to cleanse your system.\n\nAnd if your cholesterol levels aren\u2019t where you\u2019d like them to be, then take some natural herbs that help improve your cholesterol, while also:\n\noptimizing your HDL/LDL ratios\n\nlowering fatty triglycerides\n\ndecreasing homocysteine levels\n\nand also, cleansing your liver.\n\nWhat My Parents Use For Healthy Cholesterol For Over 20+ Years!\n\nThe ONLY \u201call-in-one\u201d solution that does all of this, is a formula my parents have been taking since 1999, called CholesLo. In fact, this is why my mom\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d HDL is super high and why her cardiologist is so happy with her blood test.\n\nThis is something you might want to try if you\u2019re looking for a natural, no-drug, no side-effect solution.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "The first thing I want to say is that the trend towards \u201chigh fat\u201d diets is VERY BAD for you, as discussed already in previous articles. Horrible for your heart, lipid and cholesterol levels and totally kills off your thyroid gland (which means you get FAT!).\n\nSure, these high fat/no carb diets are great for quick COSMETIC results because you lose WATER weight. But for real LONG-TERM fat loss, they are counter-productive!\n\nAnd, it\u2019s impossible to benefit if you are any kind of an athlete or if you workout (cardio and/or weights) because you will have no \u201cglycogen\u201d in your muscles to be able to work out correctly. Hence, you\u2019ll be very tired and weak.\n\nBUT on the other end of the spectrum, you also should NEVER go on a \u201cno fat\u201d diet either. Your body and brain NEEDS fat to survive.\n\nSo, if you know what kinds of fats to eat, when to eat them and what to avoid, then you can eat fat, and actually LOSE WEIGHT (NOTE: certain fats accelerate weight loss, read more below\u2026)!\n\nRule #4: Eat \u201cHealthy\u201d Fat To LOSE \u201cUgly\u201d Fat!\n\nTo INCREASE fat loss (especially in \u201cstubborn areas\u201c) you need to eat some amount of HEALTHY fats every day (about 15%-20% of your diet). It\u2019s best to do so with protein meals and as well, more so later on in the day.\n\nExamples of healthy fats would consist of UNCOOKED/RAW nuts, flaxseed oil (omega-3 fatty acids), extra virgin olive oil, avocado\u2019s, coconut oil and fish oils are good examples.\n\nFats are very important in that they slow digestion and hence, reduce insulin secretion and at the same time, keep you from getting hungry quickly after a meal. They are also beneficial because they create good hormones and enzymes, which are needed to build muscle, reduce body fat and keep your body looking and feeling YOUNG!\n\nThe hard part or real secret is that fats should NOT BE HEATED! Hence, you have some raw almonds \u2026 or a tea spoon of flaxseed oil in your protein shake or a bit of olive oil on top of your salad. When you cook/heat/fry fats, they become hydrogenated and they aren\u2019t as beneficial for your body \u2026 not to mention, they can increase the potential of getting cancer.\n\nOne fat I do cook with is coconut oil \u2013 and NO, it won\u2019t raise your cholesterol levels (but more on that later).\n\nI\u2019m not saying go overboard here \u2026 but a little bit of healthy fats a day will keep your skin looking younger, increase your sex drive, lubricate your joints and reduce aches and pains and arthritis and a host of other benefits.\n\nThe omega-3 fatty acids are said to be \u201cessential\u201d because they can not be produced by the body and must be obtained through our food sources. These essential fatty acids (EFA) are key components of cell membranes throughout the body, especially the eye, brain and central nervous system (they also help to enhance our moods).\n\nThis important fat is the building block of hormones, including those that regulate blood clotting, artery walls and inflammation. Many studies indicate that the omega-3 EFA from fish reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and can reduce the risk of stroke as well.\n\nWhat Does All This Mean?\n\nSimply put, you HAVE to eat some HEALTHY fats everyday because your body NEEDS them. Many of your fat-burning hormones (GH, Leptin, Insulin, etc.) will NOT work without these fats. And ironically, having mostly bad or \u201cugly\u201d fats (see below chart), further turns OFF your fat-burning hormones.\n\nIf I\u2019m going to be eating out or eating meals with \u201cBAD\u201d fats, I make sure I take 3-4 capsules of CHEATmeals\u2122 with that meal to BLOCK the absorption of these harmful fats. It\u2019s great for weight loss AND for keeping me healthy too (lowers cholesterol and blood sugar levels, keeps me \u201cregular\u201d as well)!\n\nMonounsaturated fats: Extra virgin, Olive oil, macadamia nuts, almonds, avocados\n\nEssential fatty acids: Salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, hemp seeds, flax seeds, flax oil\n\nLike everything in life, moderation is the key. Just keep your diet around 20% fats and most of them from the \u201cgood\u201d fats listed above. When you do end up eating bad fats (hey, it happens every time you eat out and very hard to prevent), then make sure you take some CHEATmeals\u2122 to block the bad fats and carbohydrates from being absorbed and help accelerate your weight loss!",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal a very simple trick for improving your health, especially when it comes to losing unwanted weight and erasing your belly fat.\n\nYou only need 1 or 2 tablespoons of it daily, It has like no calories. And no, it\u2019s not water or green tea \u2013 even though both are great for health and weight loss.\n\nWhat I\u2019m referring to is Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV).\n\nSo in one human clinical study1, lasting 12 weeks, 144 people were told to consume either 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vinegar or a placebo drink every day (which contained nothing at all).\n\nNothing else was changed in their diet or lifestyle.\n\nThose who consumed 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar per day had the following averages:\n\nWeight loss: 2.6 lbs (1.2 kg).\n\nDecrease in body fat percentage: 0.7%.\n\nDecrease in waist circumference: 0.5 in (1.4 cm).\n\nDecrease in triglycerides: 26%.\n\nThis is what changed in those consuming 2 tablespoon (30 ml) of vinegar per day:\n\nWeight loss: 3.7 lbs (1.7 kg).\n\nDecrease in body fat percentage: 0.9%.\n\nDecrease in waist circumference: 0.75 in (1.9 cm).\n\nDecrease in triglycerides: 26%.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that the placebo group actually gained 0.9 lbs (0.4 kgs), and their waist circumference slightly increased.\n\nAccording to this study, adding 1 or 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to your diet can help you lose weight. It can also reduce your body fat percentage, make you lose belly fat and decrease your blood triglycerides.\n\nHow Does Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) Work?\n\nSo the \u201csecret\u201d mechanism to how apple cider vinegar works has to do with optimizing some of your fat loss hormones.\n\nApple cider vinegar works through 3 simple \u201cweight loss\u201d mechanisms.\n\nIt acts as an appetite suppressant.2 So you feel fuller, longer because of the acetic acid in vinegar.\n\nIt improves your blood sugar levels3. Remember, high blood sugar and insulin converts the foods you eat, into body fat.\n\nIt prevents fat accumulation because it stimulates your metabolism and makes you burn fat faster.1\n\nIt has other health benefits such as improving triglycerides, detoxing your body and improving digestion\u2026 which all help utilize the foods you eat for energy, rather than fat storage.\n\nI use it in my morning water \u2026 which has lemon juice, glutamine amino acid and some other nutrients.\n\nYou can use it before each meal you eat, just take 1 tablespoon and wash it down with some water.\n\nYou can use it like salad dressing along with some lemon juice and herbs.\n\nJust start with 1 tablespoon at a time. Then increase it multiple times during the day. Even if you just do it morning and night, that\u2019s a great start.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Best Kind?\n\nSince apples are heavily sprayed with pesticides, you need to buy raw, unprocessed, unfiltered and organic apple cider vinegar to enjoy the full health benefits.\n\nOne of the most popular brands and the one I use is by Bragg I get the one that says \u201cWith The Mother\u201d on it Which is basically strands of proteins, enzymes and friendly bacteria that give the product a murky appearance. Just make sure you shake it first because it settles at the bottom.\n\nSo there you have it. All you need is 1-2 tablespoons daily of organic apple cider vinegar to enjoy effortless fat loss, a flatter belly and a healthier body.\n\nAnd if you really want to accelerate your fat loss and look younger, make sure you click the link below in the description area, so you can watch the bonus video and Discover The Big \u201cWeight Loss Scam\u201d \u2013 Why 93% of Diet & Exercise Programs Fail.\n\nPlus, how you can quickly and naturally turn ON your \u201cfat burning genes\u201d.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.
