    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today I\u2019m going to discuss one of the most important aspects of health and more so, about your LIFE.\n\nAnd this has to do with how you can quickly and dramatically increase your energy levels for both your body AND mind.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not talking about fake or temporary energy you get from stimulants like caffeine.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll discover will allow your body to produce maximum energy levels from within, naturally \u2026 all day long.\n\nAs far as your BODY \u2014 this means more physical energy, better muscular stamina, and faster recovery.\n\nAs far as your MIND \u2014 this means better memory, more focus, and improved mental speed and cognition.\n\nAll of this leads to amazing anti-aging qualities, which allows you to get the MOST out of your life, every single day.\n\nBecause let\u2019s face it, when you have maximum energy \u2013 you can do anything!\n\nYou\u2019ll wake up happier.\n\nYou\u2019ll get more work done.\n\nYou\u2019ll have the energy to exercise.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to keep up with your kids.\n\nYou\u2019ll be more productive.\n\n\u2026 and all of this leads to a more fulfilling and youthful life!\n\nBut when you\u2019re tired and fatigued \u2014 you don\u2019t want to do anything. You can\u2019t give to your relationships, let alone yourself.\n\nHeck, you can\u2019t even enjoy your leisure time because you\u2019re just too tired and you\u2019ll probably want to just do nothing other than sleep and watch TV.\n\nBecause this is such an important topic, I\u2019m going to do a multi-part series about it.\n\nRather than one long article, I\u2019ll make about 7 short ones that will allow you to easily fix each of the 7 energy pathways. You\u2019ll be able to quickly implement what I suggest and thus, allow you to see instant improvements within days or even hours.\n\nSo today I\u2019m going to give a quick overview of the 7 energy pathways that will allow you to optimize and maximize your energy levels for both your BODY and BRAIN.\n\nPathway #1: Stress / Adrenal / Cortisol\n\nStress disrupts multiple biochemical pathways, including cortisol production (a primary stress hormone), adrenal production (a primary cause of fatigue), pro-inflammatory enzyme production (a primary cause of disease) and neurotransmitter production (a primary cause of brain aging).2,3,4\n\nSadly, an estimated 75% \u2013 90% of visits to primary care physicians are now related to the effects of stress.5\n\nYou may not be able to stop stress, but for longevity and health reasons, you need to give your body specific nutrients to help manage and reduce \u201cstress side-effects\u201d.\n\nStress depletes your body of key hormones and nutrients, which cause physical, mental, and emotional fatigue.\n\nSo our job is to give your body what it\u2019s lacking, so it can easily manage daily stress.\n\nPathway #2: Mitochondria\n\nMitochondrial function is one of the most important metrics of whole-body health. Mitochondria are located in every cell and tissue in the human body.1\n\nIn fact, your muscles contain the highest mitochondrial content of any tissue in your body. This includes your heart muscle too.\n\nMitochondria oxidize or \u201cburn\u201d carbohydrates, proteins, and fatty acids for energy.\n\nWhen this is done correctly, the foods you eat get utilized for energy and \u201cheat\u201d, rather than stored as body fat.\n\nUnfortunately, as we age our mitochondria production dramatically drops.\n\nThis explains why we have less energy, lose muscle, feel colder, have heart disease, and get fatter.\n\nAll of this energy that\u2019s being produced by Mitochondria, is done so by yielding ATP \u2013 which stands for adenosine triphosphate.\n\nHaving higher levels of ATP provides more of the energy molecules needed to perform many daily activities.6\n\nSimply stated, mitochondria produce ATP, and ATP is absolutely essential for survival. Without a sufficient generation of ATP, life would cease to exist.\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and cognition.\n\nIt\u2019s known as the anti-aging \u201cpleasure chemical\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, dopamine levels decline as we age resulting in decreased mental performance, depression, \u201cdrive\u201d, and accelerated brain aging.7\n\nPathway #5: Acetylcholine\n\nA decline in acetylcholine levels coincides with advancing age and is a hallmark of neurodegeneration, which can lead to memory loss.\n\nProper acetylcholine function is essential to muscle control, sleep, and cognition.8\n\nPathway #6: Circulation & Oxygen\n\nThere are 3 things we need to survive:\n\nFood \u2013 without it we\u2019d typically die in about a week\n\nWater \u2013 without it we\u2019d die in about 3 days\n\nOxygen \u2013 without it we\u2019d die in minutes\n\nUnfortunately, as we age, oxygen usage drops and so does blood circulation.\n\nAnd remember, your blood contains all the nutrients, enzymes, hormones and everything you need to heal, grow and survive.\n\nMost people don\u2019t know that the brain requires a great deal of oxygen and circulation.\n\nIn fact, cerebral blood flow is about 15% of cardiac output\u2026 Which is where all of your \u201cblood\u201d pumping is done.\n\nProper brain health, disease reduction and anti-aging benefits, require optimal cerebral circulation and oxygen utilization.\n\nPathway #7: Nootropic\n\nNow, this final method of increasing bull body energy levels has to do with utilizing nootropics.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a pathway, but something that has dramatic anti-aging benefits.\n\nNootropics, a Greek word meaning \u2018Towards the Mind\u2019, are compounds that are known as cognitive enhancers, which help optimize brain functions and improve brain health.\n\nboost both mental and physical energy\n\nenhance memory and recall10\n\nincrease mental speed, concentration and focus13\n\nanti-aging benefits12\n\npromote higher IQ/intelligence 11,13\n\nIs There A Simple Solution?\n\nSo I know I just covered a bunch of medical jargon and you may be thinking \u201cOkay, so now what?\u2026 is there a simple solution that fixes all of this at once?\u201d\n\nYes, there is a solution \u2026 But it\u2019s not simple. It\u2019s actually very complicated.\n\nHowever, the good news for you and me is that the solution is VERY EASY to implement and you can see and feel results the same day.\n\nIt\u2019s a natural pill that contains specific herbs and amino acids, that help improve all the above-mentioned \u201cenergy pathways\u201d. I\u2019ve been utilizing this formula of herbs for 20+ years.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how it works for you and improving your energy levels \u2013 body and brain!\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.mangomannutrition.com/mitochondrial-biogenesis-part1\n\nComp Biochem Physiol Part D Genomics Proteomics. 2012 Jun;7(2):161-71.\n\nScience. 2010 Dec 3;330(6009):1349-54.\n\nJ Clin Sleep Med. 2007 Dec 15;3(7):681-8\n\nhttp://www.stress.org/americas-1-health-problem\n\nBull Exp Biol Med. 2003 Dec;136(6):585-7\n\nJ Altern Complement Med. 2011 Jul;17(7):635-7.\n\nNitsch R, et al.

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 now and a common complaint among older adults is the loss of physical and mental energy. And this is because as people age, their cells\u2019 ability to produce energy is diminished.\n\nMany scientists believe that cellular energy deficit is a critical factor in the onset of many problems. Having higher levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) provides more of the energy molecules need, to perform many daily activities.1\n\nSo, today I\u2019m going to reveal 2 clinically proven ingredients that you can take, that will:\n\nIncrease your cellular energy by promoting higher levels of ATP\u2026 which gives all your cells more energy all day long\n\nImprove exercise endurance after a single dose2\n\nSignificantly improve physical and cognitive function3\u2026 which means better memory\n\nHelp alleviate both physical and mental fatigue\u2026 especially important if you have any kind of adrenal fatigue\n\nAnd the best part is these 2 ingredients can be taken daily, safely \u2014 with no negative side-effects. In fact, they will help improve your health, fitness and longevity.\n\nAnd the best part is these 2 ingredients can be taken daily, safely \u2014 with no negative side-effects. In fact, they will help improve your health, fitness and longevity.\n\nThe first ingredient is Rhodiola extract (3% rosavins, NLT 1% salidrosides). This remarkable herb has the ability to support cellular energy metabolism by promoting higher levels of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and CP (creatine phosphate) in the mitochondria.\n\nIn human clinical trials, rhodiola aided exercise endurance after just a single dose2 and increased several measures of mental performance, including associative thinking, short-term memory, concentration, calculation and speed of audio/visual perception.\n\nStatistically, significant improvements were reported after just two weeks of supplementation, with continued improvements with long term usage.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is note is that clinical usage is at 120 mgs with 3% extract (3% rosavins, 1% salidrosides)\n\nThe second ingredient is NADH. This is a natural coenzyme derived from vitamin B3 (niacin), which is essential for basic metabolism, respiration, the breakdown of sugars and fats, and the production of ATP, the primary energy molecule in our cells.\n\nNADH supplies ATP energy to the brain, nerves, muscles, heart and all other organs.\n\nNADH is very powerful, so you only need about 5 mgs daily.\n\nThe Best Combination That\u2019s Scientifically Proven\n\nNow, I don\u2019t recommend you take each of these ingredients individually because it\u2019s time-consuming, not convenient and becomes expensive over time.\n\nPlus, when these 2 ingredients are combined with a few other natural ingredients, you\u2019ll get much better effects and benefits \u2013 while saving you time and money.\n\nThe good news is that if you want to improve your memory, reduce your risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s\u2026\n\nWhile also increasing energy levels, mood, cognition, and physical stamina by optimizing your youthful hormones and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, stress hormones, ATP, and mitochondria, I suggest using one of my favorite all-natural solutions called Body-Brain Energy.\n\nNow, I recommend Body-Brain Energy because it already combines these 2 ingredients with other, clinically proven ingredients\u2026. at the correct extract AND dosage amount.\n\nThis is what I personally use for myself, my family, clients, patients and even my professional athletes.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy...

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/how-menopause-causes-memory-loss-how-to-reverse-it/",
    "content": "A little bit of memory loss is a natural part of aging. And part of the reason isn\u2019t just due to aging, but partly for the lack of brain stimulation. Basically, as you get older, you\u2019re no longer challenging your brain like you used to in your younger years\u2026 you\u2019re not learning anything new.\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d\n\nHowever, hormones also play a major role in memory \u2014 for both men and women.\n\nThe decline in testosterone for MEN, which causes \u201candropause\u201d\u2026\n\nAnd the decline in estrogen in WOMEN, which causes menopause, a major reason for memory problems and general \u201cbrain\u201d fogginess.\n\nI\u2019ll discuss the guys in another article.\n\nToday I want to focus on women and menopause,\u2026 memory loss and how to prevent and reverse this, while also increasing your energy levels for BOTH your mind and body!\n\nEstrogen & Perimenopause\n\nAs you age, your ovaries stop working as well as they once did. Over time, they produce fewer eggs and eventually stop entirely. Your body responds by reducing the amount of estrogen it produces because the hormone is no longer needed for reproduction.\n\nThis process doesn\u2019t happen immediately. During perimenopause \u2014 the transitional time before menopause \u2014 your estrogen levels go up and down a lot. This is when many women experience symptoms associated with the transition to menopause.\n\nFor example, hot flashes and night sweats occur when fluctuating estrogen levels send a false message to your brain that your body is overheating. Sleep disturbances occur because of reduced levels of estrogen and progesterone. Mood changes and depression are common, as well.\n\nAnd research has clearly shown that the drop in estrogen and other female hormones, triggers memory loss and \u201cbrain fog\u201d.1-3\n\nEstrogen & Memory Loss\n\nThe exact effect of estrogen and progesterone loss on the brain isn\u2019t fully understood. It\u2019s believed that estrogen may help the neurotransmitter systems that send signals in brain areas involved in memory and information processing. Many researchers also think that estrogen promotes the growth and survival of neurons, the cells that send electrical impulses.1-3\n\nThese impulses serve as messages that are crucial for making your brain and nervous system work properly.\n\nSix Proven Ways To Help Avoid & Reverse Memory Problems\n\nSo, let\u2019s get down to the solutions.\n\n1 \u2013 Hormone Replacement Therapy\n\nMy area of study is in pharmacology and endocrinology\u2026 which is the study of hormones. So, one of the ways to prevent these problems is to supplement both estrogen and progesterone. Doing so during perimenopause or early stages of menopause works best.\n\nHowever, I do NOT advocate taking synthetic versions of these 2 hormones. Speak to your doctor about taking \u201cbioidentical\u201d versions, which are natural forms of estrogen and progesterone.\n\nGranted, this isn\u2019t something you can do for the rest of your life. So keep that in mind, it\u2019s not a long-term fix.\n\nSo let\u2019s continue on with natural, long-term ways of improving your hormones.\n\nRest improves your hormones, especially by decreasing elevated levels of stress hormones.\n\nThere are lots of things you can do to get more or BETTER rest. Sleep is one. Meditation and relaxation are also ways. Avoiding stimulants such as caffeine is important as well.\n\nOf course, food controls your hormones as well. You should eat more healthy fats, such as fish oils, extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nut oil, coconut oil, raw nuts, seeds, and avocados.\n\nFor protein, eat more fatty fish, such as salmon. But eliminate high mercury fish such as tuna, which will cause memory loss. Whole eggs, a little bit of chicken and bison are also good.\n\nBest forms of carbohydrates are typically vegetables, white rice, yams, and sweet potatoes.\n\nLimit alcohol, sugars, heated/hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners and baked goods/desserts.\n\n4 \u2013 Exercise Your Body\n\nMotions creates emotion and also improves blood flow. Exercise doesn\u2019t need to be complicated.\n\nI suggest taking a 20-30 min brisk walk every day, or at least 3x weekly.\n\nAnd you must also do some resistance exercise, 3x weekly. Lifting weights is very important for hormone production and improving blood flow. You can use machines, cables or even your own body weight.\n\n5 \u2013 Exercise Your Brain\n\nThis part most people skip out, but you MUST exercise your brain to prevent it from \u201cshrinking\u201d.\n\nRead more and learn something new. There are lots of \u201conline mind games\u201d, such as Lumosity.com, which are fun and keep your brain, synapses, and neurons fresh.\n\nThere are a few powerful herbs that will work like \u201csteroids\u201d for your brain. They\u2019ll improve your blood flow, increase neurotransmitters, strengthen synapses and neurons\u2026 while also improving other brain chemicals \u2014 such as dopamine and serotonin.\n\nJust because you\u2019re getting older and have gone through menopause or aren\u2019t producing the same level of hormones you used to when you were younger, does NOT mean that you have to go through the rest of your life \u201cfeeling\u201d old\u2026 and having memory problems and being forgetful and having brain fog and feeling tired and lethargic or even depressed.\n\nThe only difference is now you have to put in a little more effort, to fix this problem.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t do anything, you already know that the problem is only going to get worse. So please take action today and make some of the improvements I\u2019ve listed in today\u2019s article.\n\nOver time, make more and more improvements in your lifestyle and I promise you, not only will you feel younger, you\u2019ll also look younger as well!\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy...

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 now and today\u2019s topic is very important for anyone over the age of 40 and especially to me because I have a family history of brain and memory problems, mainly from my dad\u2019s side of the family.\n\nSo if you\u2019re concerned about your memory and you\u2019d like to improve it \u2026. And help prevent the onset or progression of cognitive and memory problems, please read today\u2019s article.\n\nNo \u201cCure\u201d For Bad Memory?\u2026\n\nNow, the media will lead you to believe there is no \u201ccure\u201d for such memory and cognition problems.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s not even the media\u2019s fault \u2013 it\u2019s what the Pharmaceutical companies tell everyone.\n\nAnd, I used to believe this myself.\n\nI figured that it must be \u201call genetics\u201d and there\u2019s nothing you can do. After all, that\u2019s what they told us in school.\n\nUnfortunately, this is all a big lie and recent research has exposed this.\n\nThe real truth is that there IS a way to slow down the progression of memory problems. In fact, you can actually STOP it and potentially \u201cavoid\u201d it from even happening.\n\nIn fact, new studies reveal EXACTLY how to do it, in addition to the REAL cause!1-6\n\nThe key isn\u2019t in the beta-amyloid tangles that get so much attention (and have been the target of so many FAILED pharmaceutical drugs).\n\nIt\u2019s something else: an ugly little \u201cmistake\u201d in the brain called tau tangles.\n\nThey pop up FIRST\u2026 especially in the brain stem\u2026 and as they accumulate, everything starts to fall apart.\n\nWhen tau spreads out and hits the cortex, you\u2019ve got memory problems.\n\nHere\u2019s How To Stop The Disease\n\nStop the tau, and you can help stop the disease.\n\nBut the first challenge is that you have to SPOT it, and you might think that\u2019s impossible without expensive brain scans.\n\nThat\u2019s where the new studies come in1-6 because there IS a way to spot the early warning signs of tau and you don\u2019t need a scan or even a doctor.\n\nCauses Depressive Feelings & Sleep Problems\n\nThe new studies reveal that MOOD CHANGES and SLEEP problems can all be early warning signs of that tau short-circuit, especially in older folks over the age of 45.\n\nNow, these aren\u2019t the CAUSE of memory loss.\n\nThey\u2019re warning signs, but they\u2019re warning signs of that same tau accumulation.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where this gets tricky.\n\nSee, you might think treating these conditions can stop the tau. But that\u2019s NOT how Big Pharma \u201ctreatment\u201d works.\n\nIn fact, those meds are custom-crafted to ensure you CONTINUE to SUFFER!\n\nThe truth is, drug makers don\u2019t profit from cures\u2026 and I\u2019m sure you already know this.\n\nIf you could take a shot one time \u2026 or swallow some pills for a few days or a couple of weeks and then be done with it, they don\u2019t earn the big bucks.\n\nThere\u2019s no continued revenue stream from you, month after month, year after year.\n\nInstead, the real way for them to make billions year after year is to create drugs that \u201cmanage\u201d problems rather than cure them.\n\nWhy Drugs Are Designed To NOT Work\n\nThey fight the SYMPTOM, but not the CAUSE.\n\nThat helps explain why many people who start taking drugs NEVER stop. In fact, they increase the dosage over the years and many times, ADD ON additional drugs to fight the negative side effects of the original drug.\n\nA Better Way To \u201cFix\u201d It\n\nHowever, the good news for you is that there is a much BETTER way to \u201cFIX\u201d these problems and REPAIR the underlying causes.\n\nYou need to start taking natural, brain-protecting nutrients.\n\nTo start with, I suggest everyone take a multi-complex B vitamin supplement. B12 (methylcobalamin form is best) is one of the more important B vitamins.\n\nMake sure you also take some omega-3 fatty acids. This would be fish oils. However, if you\u2019re a vegetarian, then you can try flaxseed and hemp oil, but they aren\u2019t as effective.\n\nUnfortunately, trying to get these strictly from \u201cfood-only\u201d sources just won\u2019t be enough or effective\u2026 And this is why I\u2019m suggesting supplements.\n\nBrain Protective Ingredients\n\nAdditionally, I would highly suggest taking clinically proven, \u201cbrain-protective\u201d, energy-producing ingredients such as\n\nDifferent forms of Choline\n\nThere are a few other ingredients I recommend and the ones I also take myself.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to all the nutrients I suggest and descriptions on how they all work.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t expect you to go out and purchase each of these supplements separately, it\u2019s just too expensive and too much work.\n\nIn this page, you can see how to get everything in one place, so it\u2019s easy and convenient.\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 how to protect your brain and help avoid, stop, and potentially fix memory loss, and other cognitive problems.\n\nJust know that it takes time to see results, just as it\u2019s taken many years to have these problems.\n\nSo please be patient, never give up because there\u2019s hope!\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443904001619\n\nhttps://www.brightfocus.org/alzheimers-disease/infographic/amyloid-plaques-and-neurofibrillary-tangles\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615640\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11447842\n\nhttps://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9748670",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/this-one-thing-is-clinically-proven-to-improve-energy-mind-memory/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to discuss the one thing that is clinically proven to improve your mind, your memory, your mood, and energy levels.\n\nSomething Interesting & Ironic\n\nHowever, I\u2019d like to first share something interesting and ironic \u2013 these days, we use more mental energy than ever before in history. Yet, we are using LESS physical energy than ever before and this is why I wanted to do today\u2019s topic.\n\nIn fact, your brain uses more energy than any other organ in your body, about 20-25% of total energy use \u2013 which means calories \u2013 both fat and sugar.\n\nAnd this is at REST, meaning when you\u2019re just doing almost nothing \u2013 sleeping, being lazy, and no activity.\n\nSo, if you want to burn more calories, you should consider thinking more.\n\nThe irony is I believe people think even LESS these days. They are on auto-pilot. They react to situations, instead of acting \u2013 which requires you to stop, think, analyze, and then proceed forward.\n\nInstead, like most animals, people just \u2018react\u2019 to situations and life, while spending very little time THINKING first and then acting. Their subconscious mind is doing almost all the work.\n\nAnd this is mainly because so much of our lives is run by technology.\n\nFor example, in the old days, I used to memorize at least a dozen different phone numbers and probably more than 20-30.\n\nThese days, I barely remember my own phone number. I have no need \u2013 it\u2019s already programmed in my mobile phone.\n\nSame with directions and addresses \u2013 just put it in Google Maps and that\u2019s it.\n\nAnd if you Uber it, you\u2019re thinking even less.\n\nBut More Mental Stress\n\nHowever, we are under even more mental stress now than ever before in history because too much is happening at once. And people make it worse by multi-tasking or at least, TRYING to multitask.\n\nI think most people, especially the younger people who grew up with the internet, would probably freak out if they unplugged all their electronic devices for a weekend.\n\nIt\u2019s too quiet for their brain \u2013 which is exactly what the brain requires to THINK.\n\nAdditionally, all of these extra \u201cmental stress\u201d is accelerating brain aging. A definitive reason why people are having more memory problems than ever, starting at an even younger age.\n\nPlus, more anxiety, worry, depression, and poor sleep.\n\nAll of this is also depleting your body of specific nutrients, which further accelerates aging \u2013 both brain and body.\n\nThis is probably a big reason why meditation is becoming more popular these days \u2013 because we NEED it more than ever. 20-60 minutes daily to just unplug and let the brain do what it needs to do.\n\nSo where am I going with all of this?\u2026\n\nExercise Is The Solution\n\nI think there\u2019s a much better way to improve your mind than with meditation and that\u2019s with exercise. Plus you\u2019ll obviously get lots of physical and overall health benefits as well.\n\nSo, today I\u2019m going to list the top 10 clinically proven reasons for you to exercise, so you can:\n\nimprove your mind and brain function\n\navoid and help reverse mental issues such as dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and so forth\n\nimprove your mental hormones and neurotransmitters, so you\u2019ll feel better, improve your mood, and be happier\n\nhave more clarity and even increase your intelligence (IQ)\n\nincrease both physical and mental energy, while also getting deeper and better sleep at the same time\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need much exercise to get all of these benefits. You don\u2019t even need a gym or any equipment either. And I\u2019ll tell you how much and the best kind of exercise in about a minute.\n\nPlus, if you add in some natural and healthy vitamins and herbs specific for improving your brain and increasing your energy levels, you will literally feel so much younger and perform much better within days or even hours.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more information about that at the end of this article.\n\nTop 10 Clinically Proven Benefits Of Exercise For Your Mind and Mental Health\n\nPhysical exercise can help you pay attention better, learn and think faster, and remember more. 1-3 One huge study on over 1 million young, healthy men found it actually raised IQ. 4\n\nExercise makes you more effective and productive by improving creativity, mental flexibility, concentration, ability to manage time, and decision-making. 10-14\n\nExercising can make you happier by improving your hormones, both immediately and long term.5-6 Plus, exercise can help improve your emotions, pull yourself out of bad moods, and be more emotionally resilient. 7-9\n\nExercise also reduces your appetite and cravings for sugary and fatty foods, both of which are not good for brain health. It does so by improving various chemicals, such as dopamine and serotonin.\n\nPhysical exercise can make you less anxious and less prone to stress-induced depression. 15-16 In fact, a Duke University study found that exercise worked even better than popular antidepressant drugs, such as Zoloft. 17\n\nExercise boosts energy, spurs enthusiasm, and encourages you to have more fun, be more outgoing and playful. 18\n\nBecause exercise helps build muscle, lose fat, and improve your hormones \u2013 it helps improve your self-esteem and libido, making you feel more attractive, regardless of your age. 19-20\n\nIt\u2019s been repeatedly shown that exercise relieves symptoms of a wide range of mental health disorders including ADHD, anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. 21-23\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation reports that getting 150 minutes of exercise a week improves sleep quality by 65%. That\u2019s just 20 minutes daily. What\u2019s interesting is that people with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, or ADHD are 5 times more likely than average to experience chronic insomnia. Thus, by simply getting better sleep, many people experience substantial relief from their symptoms.24-25\n\nExercise increases your energy levels throughout the entire day \u2013 both physical and mental. Thus, the ideal time to exercise is in the morning, so you\u2019re energized all day long.\n\nBest Exercise, How Much & How Often\n\nAnd as far as how much, how often and the type of exercise \u2013 this is also very simple.\n\nTo start with, just walk daily. Even 10 minutes is a great start. Do it outside preferably and first thing in the morning. Walking before or after meals is also great. Again, you only need 10 minutes.\n\nThe ideal scenario is you do resistance exercise, 3-4x weekly. You only need 30 minutes. This is with weights, cables, machines, and so forth.\n\nAnd then just walk the rest of the time. You can do it on your non-weight lifting days. Or, just do it daily. 10 minutes to start and as much as 60 minutes. And breaking it up multiple times a day is even better. 10 min, 3x daily is better than 30 minutes.\n\nEven if you have a limp or had knee surgery or any other injury, anyone can walk. Just start slow and build up daily.\n\nDepletion Of Vitamins & Minerals\n\nLastly, as I stated earlier, we are under a lot more mental stress these days. Our foods have fewer nutrients. All of this means we are depleted of essential vitamins, minerals, and herbs \u2014 which is accelerating mental problems and causing us to be more tired, run-down, and wanting to keep reaching for toxic caffeine products.\n\nSo in addition to exercising more, I want you to give your mind AND body specific nutrients, which are designed to dramatically and naturally increase your energy levels \u2014 no caffeine or stimulants.\n\nHere\u2019s a special link to the best ingredients and formula.\n\nPlease do this now, while it\u2019s fresh on your mind. And make sure to take care of your brain by exercising more.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "There\u2019s a really great ESSENTIAL nutrient that I\u2019ve known about and have taken for almost 30 years and I want to share it with you today.\n\nInitially, I took it because it\u2019s very important for having healthy muscles, liver, nervous system, and metabolism.\n\nNow, the cool thing is that this essential nutrient is also very important for brain health, development, memory, and cognition.\n\nAnd this nutrient, which many people incorrectly add to the B Vitamins, is called Choline.\n\nCholine is neither a vitamin or a mineral.\n\nIt literally is an essential nutrient that has similar functions as the B Vitamins.\n\nUnfortunately, most people have low levels of Choline and some are actually deficient in it.\n\nAnd this is probably because Choline is found primarily in foods that most people don\u2019t eat these days, such as beef or chicken liver, eggs, or fresh cod.\n\nAnd this is where supplementation comes in and can be very helpful.\n\n3 Best Forms Of Choline\n\nThe 3 best choline types of supplements are:\n\nAlpha-GPC is a crucial building block for the production of acetylcholine in the brain.\n\nIt has cognitive-enhancing properties and reduces the rate of cognitive decline in the elderly.\n\nIt also has the ability to enhance growth hormone production and power output, which helps benefit athletes and those over the age of 40.\n\nCDP-Choline (aka, Citicoline) activates the synthesis of critical components in cell membranes, enhances cerebral energy metabolism, and increases levels of various neurotransmitters\n\nThere\u2019s another ingredient I really like that\u2019s NOT directly a Choline nutrient and that\u2019s:\n\nHuperzine A \u2013 is a standardized extract from the Chinese club moss and is an all-natural herbal supplement that has been shown to maintain healthy levels of acetylcholine.\n\nMost importantly, it is known as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.\n\nSo using these 3 ingredients together accomplishes two main goals:\n\nAn increase in choline and acetylcholine\n\nAnd a decrease in the breakdown of acetylcholine.\n\nIt\u2019s like making more money and saving more money at the same time, which means you end up doubling your savings.\n\nYou can buy these ingredients separately, which can get costly and inconvenient, which is what I used to do.\n\nOr you can use a product called Body-Brain Energy, which is what I use because in addition to improving Acetylcholine levels it also helps promote healthy levels of:\n\nDecrease stress & adrenal issues\n\nImproves oxygen uptake for your cells\n\nMaximizes Mitochondria\n\nIt\u2019s a super-powerful Nootropic that increases both physical energy and mental focus.\n\nNo stimulants either.\n\nBest of all, Body-Brain Energy comes with a one-year guarantee and results in 30 days or a full refund PLUS an extra $100.00 cashback on top of it.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a crazy guarantee only because the product REALLY works and has over a 20+ year proven track record.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy...

    "content": "Today, it\u2019s 2025 and I want to share something with you that has completely transformed my life.\n\nIt\u2019s simple yet incredibly powerful: what you focus on determines your outcomes in life.\n\nThis one shift in mindset can help you achieve your goals, make you happier, and allow you to live a more fulfilling life. Let\u2019s dive into why focus matters and how to apply it effectively.\n\nWhy You Get What You Focus On\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cIn life, you get what you focus on.\u201d This means:\n\nFocus on the positive, and you\u2019ll see more opportunities and solutions.\n\nFocus on the negative; you\u2019ll see more problems and feel stuck.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a mindset; it\u2019s a habit.\n\nPositive people tend to achieve their goals because they focus on what\u2019s possible and persist even when challenges arise.\n\nOn the other hand, negative people often give up early, don\u2019t fully commit, or fail to see opportunities even when they\u2019re right in front of them.\n\nThe Power of Positive Focus\n\nHere\u2019s why focusing on the positive works:\n\nYou\u2019ll notice opportunities: When you focus on solutions, your mind becomes attuned to spotting them.\n\nTake action: A positive outlook encourages you to try, even if things haven\u2019t worked out in the past.\n\nBuild persistence: Staying positive helps you push through setbacks without giving up.\n\nThink about this: when you buy a new car, you suddenly start noticing that same car everywhere. That\u2019s because it\u2019s now on your mind.\n\nSimilarly, whatever you choose to focus on will seem to \u201cexpand\u201d in your life.\n\nChoose Your Focus Wisely\n\nIf you spend your time focusing on problems, you\u2019ll see more of them. You\u2019ll think:\n\n\u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuccess is impossible for me.\u201d\n\nHowever successful people focus on solutions.\n\nFor example, when I wanted to gain muscle, I studied everything I could about it, read books, asked questions, and constantly thought about how to improve. That single-minded focus helped me achieve my goal.\n\nHow to Train Your Focus for Success\n\nHere are actionable tips to build a positive focus:\n\nSpend 90-95% of your energy on solutions, not problems. Don\u2019t rehash the past or dwell on what went wrong. Instead, focus on actionable steps you can take today.\n\nDon\u2019t rehash the past or dwell on what went wrong. Instead, focus on actionable steps you can take today.\n\nLive in the present. Worrying about the future causes anxiety, and obsessing over the past leads to depression. Focus on the now.\n\nWorrying about the future causes anxiety, and obsessing over the past leads to depression. Focus on the now.\n\nPractice persistence. Achieving your goals takes time, effort, and consistency. Even if it takes longer than expected, never give up.\n\nAchieving your goals takes time, effort, and consistency. Even if it takes longer than expected, never give up.\n\nAnalyze your thoughts and words. Pay attention to the language you use. Are you using positive or negative words?

The more time you invest in your goal, the more likely you are to achieve it.\n\nWhy Focus Is Essential for Happiness\n\nIf you don\u2019t train your focus, the default is negativity. Why?\n\nThe world around you is full of negativity. News, social media, and people\u2019s complaints can drain your mindset.\n\nNews, social media, and people\u2019s complaints can drain your mindset.\n\nYour focus \u201cmuscle\u201d weakens over time.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/5-clinically-proven-solutions-for-lowering-high-blood-pressure/",
    "content": "Most people don\u2019t know that blood pressure problems are a leading killer and a primary cause of heart failure in 2025, as well as aneurysms, cognitive/memory decline, and kidney failure.\n\nOver 70 million American adults have blood pressure problems \u2013 that\u2019s 1 out of every 3 adults or 33% of the population.1\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy is that another 33% of the adult population has \u201cpre-condition\u201d, which is higher than normal blood pressure, but not in the super-high \u201cwarning\u201d range.\n\nThus, about 66% of the adult population has above \u201coptimal\u201d blood pressure levels and it only gets worse as you get older.2\n\nThis is why blood pressure is known as the \u201csilent killer\u201d because you don\u2019t really feel like there\u2019s anything wrong until it\u2019s too late!\n\nI\u2019m very familiar with this topic because I have a family history of heart failures, some of them caused by blood pressure problems.\n\nIn fact, under today\u2019s article, I\u2019ve got a short report about how my dad\u2019s got healthy blood pressure \u2013 without drugs or restrictive diets. Make sure to take a look after you finish this short article.\n\nI bring all of this up because I want to emphasize just how important it is for your health and longevity to make sure you have healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started with the top 5 natural solutions for healthy blood pressure.\n\nDrugs / Prescription Medications\n\nAs I said, blood pressure is such a massive health problem that blood pressure drugs are the #1 most prescribed drugs in America.3 In fact, out of the top 10 most prescribed drugs \u2013 THREE of them are blood pressure drugs!\n\nAnd the crazy part is that there are 11 TYPES of \u201cblood pressure\u201d drugs, which is a total of over 80 DIFFERENT medications..\n\nAnd yet, the problem is getting worse each and every year. I don\u2019t like these drugs because they have lots of negative side effects.\n\nHowever, they are valuable for SHORT-TERM usage to quickly put you into a \u201cnormal\u201d range. But it\u2019s definitely not a long-term solution.\n\nWhat you eat is very important and one of the best types of diets for lowering blood pressure is a DASH diet4 \u2013 which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.\n\nThis is similar to the Mediterranean diet \u2013 both being successful at reducing blood pressure problems and promoting weight loss at the same time.\n\nDASH promotes the consumption of vegetables, fruits, lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and recommends avoiding sugars, red meat, and salt.\n\nMany believe that low sodium is responsible for its success. However, salt probably doesn\u2019t have that much to do with it...\n\nI believe the primary reason why it works so well is that it restricts your intake of fructose\u2014as does the Mediterranean diet.\n\nThe idea that salt promotes blood pressure problems is actually, at least in part, a myth.\n\nExercise has many health benefits as I\u2019m sure you know. One of the best is the simple fact that you get some stress release. And I think we can all agree that we live in very stressful times and this additional stress contributes to blood pressure problems.\n\nThe best exercise is a combination of BOTH:\n\nAerobic (with oxygen) \u2013 walking, jogging, swimming, dancing, etc.\n\nAnaerobic (without oxygen) \u2013 resistance exercise with weights, cables, machines, etc.\n\nIdeally, 3x weekly for 30-45 minutes is a good goal. However, even a 15-minute daily walk will do wonders for your health and blood pressure levels.\n\nMost \u201cexperts\u201d don\u2019t emphasize the importance of rest and relaxation \u2013 both physical and mental.\n\nYour mind is more powerful than your body and with the extra stress and worry in our modern lifestyles, you MUST make some time to \u201cunplug\u201d and \u201creboot\u201d your system.\n\nMeditation, stretching, reading, napping, walking, writing your thoughts, getting a massage, laughing, hugging, playing, etc\u2026 are all great ways to reduce your stress hormones and improve your blood pressure levels.\n\nYou MUST do this daily. As my friend Tony Robbins says, this can be your \u201chour of power\u201d or \u201c30 minutes to thrive\u201d or \u201c15 minutes to fulfillment\u201d.\n\nSpecific Herbs, Vitamins & Minerals\n\nMost supplements don\u2019t work. However, there are a few herbs and minerals that can help support healthy blood pressure levels naturally and quickly. Many times better than prescription medications and WITHOUT the negative side effects.\n\nThe top 5 natural herbal extracts are:\n\nEnglish Hawthorn Berry Extract\n\nAdd in specific minerals and vitamins such as magnesium, potassium, calcium, D3, C, and B6 and you have a proven formula and a long-term solution for healthy blood pressure levels.\n\nFollow a DASH diet, exercise, implement a few minutes of relaxation methods and take specific herbs, vitamins, and minerals DAILY and you\u2019ll see amazing improvements in your health and blood pressure levels.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nNwankwo T, Yoon SS, Burt V, Gu Q.

    "content": "Adrenal fatigue affects people around the world, usually those who have suffered from a long period of illness and/or stress upon the body. Although fairly benign in nature, adrenal fatigue will affect your energy levels and mental focus. For many, they may not be fully aware that they have adrenal fatigue until they are tested.\n\nHowever, there are natural cures for adrenal fatigue that offers solutions which can help restore the full function of your adrenal glands quickly, easily and inexpensively. However, such methods may appear counter-intuitive at first since they involve relaxing the body instead of trying to re-energize it which is the mistake too many people make.\n\nWhat follows are a few of the simple, yet very effective natural cures for adrenal fatigue. By following the simple steps that each cure offers, you can dim the effects and perhaps even shorten the duration of this condition.\n\nThere is a class of herbs that can help your body resist stress as well as boost your energy levels as well. Rhodiola for example can help reduce stress and increase mental focus and overall performance without producing any relevant side effects. Other herbs in the class of effective stress relief include ginseng and ashwaghandha. Taking small to moderate amounts of these herbs in the form of supplements or as part of your overall diet can help reduce the effects of adrenal fatigue.\n\nIncrease Vitamin C & B5\n\nBy increasing the levels of Vitamin C & B5 in your diet, you can reduce the effects of adrenal fatigue as well. This can be accomplished by consuming foods high in Vitamin C such as citrus fruits, broccoli, red bell peppers, and papaya for example. Sources of Vitamin B5 include yogurt, corn, mushrooms and sunflower seeds.\n\nExercise is a great form of stress relief and can get your body back into shape as well. Even simple, low impact exercise such as yoga and tai chi can help lower your body\u2019s stress levels which in turn reduces the work the adrenal glands will have to do on a daily basis. However, exercise in many different forms works well to reduce stress, just be sure that you don\u2019t overdo it and burnout.\n\nIn addition to exercise, meditation is a great reliever of stress as well. Anything you can do to relieve the stress in your live is one more way to overcome adrenal fatigue. In most cases, the changes you will need to make are simple and inexpensive, but there may be situations that are causing the stress which may result in changes to your way of life in order to put them in their place.\n\nRemember to cut down on caffeine as it can pressure your adrenal glands as well and be sure to focus day by day on getting better. Overcoming adrenal fatigue will not happen overnight and in fact will take weeks, if not months to fully get behind you. However, by taking these first steps through the natural cures that are presented, you can be well on your way to getting back to you old self once again.\n\nA Fast & Easy Solution For Increasing YourEnergy & Improving Memory!\n\nThere are a ways for increasing your energy levels and improving memory + focus - diet and exercise being two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and my parents.\n\nBecause of this, I needed to find a simple, easy and fast solution for improving our energy levels and focus in MINUTES, without the use of drugs, worthless supplements or following a restrictive diet.\n\nIf this is something you're also interested in, you can easily copy my \"proven formula\", implement it and start seeing and feeling results within minutes...",

    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and if you didn\u2019t already know, at least \u2153 (33%) of US adults have blood pressure problems.1\n\nAnd about 70% of people have high blood pressure at some point in their lives.\n\nUnfortunately, having blood pressure problems is one of the leading causes of heart & brain problems.1\n\nMost people, including doctors, mistakenly consume less salt to support healthy blood pressure.\n\nHowever, low-salt diets typically don\u2019t make much of a difference.\n\nWhat does make a big difference is lowering sugar in your diet and more specifically, \u201chigh fructose corn syrup\u201d\n\nIn a recent study in the journal Open Heart2, the authors write:\n\n\u201cEvidence from epidemiological studies and experimental trials in animals and humans suggests that added sugars, particularly fructose, may increase blood pressure and blood pressure variability, increase heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, and contribute to inflammation, insulin resistance and broader metabolic dysfunction.\n\nThus, while there is no argument that recommendations to reduce consumption of processed foods are highly appropriate and advisable, the arguments in this review are that the benefits of such recommendations have less to do with sodium \u2014 minimally related to blood pressure and perhaps even inversely related to cardiovascular risk\u2014and more to do with highly-refined carbohydrates and sugars.\u201d\n\nThe Problem Started In The 1970s\n\nFood and beverage manufacturers began switching their sweeteners from sucrose (table sugar) to corn syrup in the 1970s when they discovered that High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) was far cheaper to use in their products.\n\nIn fact, HFCS is the #1 source of calories in America!!!3\n\nIt\u2019s found in almost everything you can think of. More specifically, in sodas and fruit juices. But also in many pre-packaged foods. This also includes \u201chealthy sugars\u201d sweetened with agave.\n\nMy Recommendation For You\n\nYou must do your best to limit and eliminate all HFCS and to do this, make sure you read labels. Again, the LESS pre-packaged the food, the better.\n\nLimit your TOTAL fructose to 25 grams or less, that\u2019s about 100 calories daily.\n\nThis includes the natural fructose found in fruits.\n\nIf you are already suffering from blood pressure problems or signs of insulin resistance, are overweight, and have cholesterol problems, you should be particularly careful to limit your fructose, including that from whole fruits to 15-25 grams per day or less. That\u2019s about 60-100 calories daily.\n\nSo there you have it. Focus more on limiting your sugars, this includes fruit sugar, fructose \u2026, and especially \u201chigh fructose corn syrup\u201d which is found in most pre-packaged foods, especially sodas and fruit juices.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm\n\nhttp://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000167\n\nhttp://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2005/06/14/calories-america.aspx/li>",

    "content": "Starting a weight loss journey can be tough, but including nootropics in your regimen may give you an advantage.\n\nNootropics, also known as \u201csmart drugs,\u201d are not only used for enhancing brain function, but they also provide considerable benefits for people looking to lose weight effectively..\n\nNootropics are supplements that can improve cognitive functions like focus and memory. These enhancements can be especially helpful when you\u2019re trying to follow a strict diet or exercise routine. Nootropics can also increase your metabolism and help you burn calories more efficiently, making them more than just mental enhancers.\n\nHow Nootropics Help Weight Loss\n\nNootropics contribute to weight loss by enhancing your body\u2019s metabolism and energy levels, making it easier to lose weight efficiently. They work by:\n\nBoosting Metabolism: Certain nootropics increase thermogenesis\u2014the body\u2019s heat production process\u2014helping to burn more calories even at rest.\n\nEnhancing Fat Oxidation: They aid in breaking down fat for energy, ensuring that your workouts are more effective in reducing body fat.\n\nSuppressing Appetite: By reducing cravings and appetite, nootropics can help you adhere to a calorie-controlled diet more comfortably.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to remember that nootropics are supplements that should accompany\u2014not replace\u2014a balanced diet and regular physical activity.\n\nBest Nootropics for Weight Loss\n\nHere are some nootropics known for their weight loss benefits:\n\nCaffeine: It not only sharpens your focus but also increases metabolism and fat burning.\n\nGreen Tea Extract: Rich in antioxidants, it enhances fat oxidation and also provides a mild caffeine boost.\n\nL-Theanine: Found in green tea, it works well with caffeine to enhance focus while mitigating stress and reducing appetite.\n\nRhodiola Rosea: This adaptogen increases energy levels and stamina, supporting more vigorous and prolonged workouts.\n\nFor those specifically interested in enhancing cognitive function while managing weight, consider integrating Body Brain Energy supplements into your regimen. These supplements are designed to optimize your mental and physical performance, providing a balanced blend of nootropics that supports both brain health and metabolic rate.\n\nImplementing Nootropics into Your Diet\n\nIncorporating nootropics into your weight loss plan is easy:\n\nStart with Low Doses: To assess your body\u2019s response, begin with lower doses of nootropics and gradually increase as needed.\n\nCombine with Healthy Lifestyle Choices: Pair nootropics with a nutritious diet and regular exercise for optimal results.\n\nConsult With Your Doctor: Always discuss with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.\n\nNootropics Side Effects\n\nNootropics are generally safe, but taking high doses can cause side effects such as jitters, insomnia, or digestive upset.\n\nIt\u2019s important to monitor your body\u2019s response and adjust your intake to minimize these effects. Start with lower doses and see how you feel.\n\nTaking nootropics in the morning or with the meal can also make a big difference.\n\nNootropics not only enhance cognitive function but also boost metabolism, making them the perfect addition to any weight loss plan.\n\nBy boosting your brain power and metabolism, these smart supplements can help you achieve your weight loss goals more effectively and efficiently.\n\nRemember, the key to successful weight loss is an all-in-one approach that includes diet, exercise, and the strategic use of supplements like nootropics and Body Brain Energy to support your overall health and wellness.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/general-health/what-you-must-know-about-probiotics-and-prebiotics/",
    "content": "A few months ago my friend was telling me about how she had stomach problems and so forth. I won\u2019t get into all the details, but she mentioned how her doctor said she should eat some yogurt for the \u201cbeneficial bacteria\u2026 the probiotics\u201d.\n\nI told her that yogurt is ok and there are much better options, which I\u2019ll reveal to you in a minute.\n\nHowever, I also mentioned to my friend that she must also take some prebiotics, in addition to the probiotics.\n\nThen, with a surprised and confused look on her face asked, \u201cwhat the heck are those?\u2026. I\u2019ve never even heard of them?\u2026 What\u2019s the difference between the pro and prebiotics?\u201d\n\nAnd this is the typical response I get when I tell someone about prebiotics \u2013 most people have never heard of them.\n\nAnd this is a really important topic for you because healthy \u201cgut bacteria\u201d is vital for BOTH your physical and mental/emotional health.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019ve ever taken antibiotics, then you should for sure read today\u2019s article because antibiotics kill off these important bacteria and it can take months before your gut bacteria is back to healthy levels.\n\nMany people have heard of probiotics, but not too many have heard of prebiotics and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to quickly discuss today \u2013 the differences in the two and why you should take both.\n\nPlus, the best foods and supplements to get both from.\n\nDifference Between Probiotics and Prebiotics\n\nEven though they sound similar, the two play different roles for your health.\n\nProbiotics are beneficial bacteria, while prebiotics are food for these bacteria.\n\nEven though they play different roles in your body, both are extremely important and work best when taken together. In a short summary:\n\nProbiotics: These are live bacteria found in certain foods or supplements. They can provide numerous health benefits, such as:\n\nHelp prevent and treat diarrhea\n\nKeep your regular and your colon healthy\n\nImprove mental and emotional health\n\nKeep your heart healthy\n\nBoost your immune system\n\nEven help lose weight and belly fat\n\nPrebiotics: These substances come from types of carbs (mostly fiber) that humans can\u2019t digest. The beneficial bacteria in your gut eat this fiber.\n\nBasically, PREbiotics are fuel for the PRObiotics. Prebiotics help feed the PRObiotics and healthy bacteria in your gut.\n\nThus, with the addition of prebiotics, the probiotics you take will do more and continue to grow and get stronger.\n\nWhere To Get Your Probiotics\n\nYou can get these from food and supplements.\n\nAs far as food sources, yogurt is one that most people have heard of. If you make home-made yogurt, it\u2019s much healthier and has higher prebiotics than the store bought ones.\n\nHowever, I prefer fermented foods such as:\n\nSauerkraut \u2013 which has REALLY high amounts\n\nKefir (dairy and non-dairy, I suggest NON)\n\nYour other option is in supplement form, which is what I personally do. Now, this can get really complicated because there are so many strains and quantity.\n\nSome are just 2 strains and have a few million \u201cmicroorganisms\u201d and \u201ccultures\u201d. Then we have those that might have as many as over 12 strains and 90+ BILLION \u201cmicroorganisms/cultures\u201d.\n\nThe higher the amounts, the more effective.\n\nAgain, this is too complicated to get into the details in today\u2019s article.\n\nHowever, I will give you some suggestions.\n\nThe higher the amount, the more effective it is.\n\nStart low and build up. If you take too much or too high of strains/cultures, you\u2019ll be going to the bathroom a lot.\n\nKeep switching brands, strains and culture amounts every 1-2 months to prevent your gut from adapting and to introduce new strains and cultures.\n\nKeep it refrigerated, so it stays fresh, active and \u201calive\u201d.\n\nWhere To Get Your Prebiotics\n\nSimilar to probiotics, you can get these from food and supplements.\n\nPrebiotics are types of fiber found in carbohydrate sources.\n\nFoods that are high in prebiotic fiber include:\n\nLegumes, beans, and peas.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that you do need to eat a lot of these foods to get a good amount of prebiotics.\n\nThis is why I just take a supplement for it, to guarantee I get a good amount of prebiotics. There are many brands that sell prebiotics. If you want to keep it simple and really inexpensive, which is what I do \u2014 I just take Inulin powder.\n\nI take it at night and you don\u2019t need much \u2014 just \u00bc or \u00bd TEAspoon to start with. You\u2019ll feel it in the morning and your colon will thank you for it.\n\nThe prebiotics help feed and fuel the probiotics. You don\u2019t need to take them at the same time, but you should take both daily.\n\nThese two are one of my favorites \u2013 \u201cgotta have supplements\u201d and \u201cfoods\u201d in my diet for overall health, fitness, and longevity \u2014 inside and out, physical and mental/emotional.\n\nSo if you aren\u2019t taking them, please do so.",

    "content": "Today it\u2019s 2025 and you\u2019ll discover one of the most powerful vitamins that helps shrink the prostate and improves erections.\n\nAdditional benefits are:\n\nImproved immune function\n\nYouthful skin and hair\n\nIncreased energy levels\n\nHealthy cognition, memory & brain function\n\nUnfortunately, most people \u2013 both men and women, are either deficient in it or have low or sub-optimal levels.\n\nThis is the first time I talk about it and its benefits for healthy prostate function \u2013 it\u2019s Vitamin D.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT Actually A Vitamin\u2026.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched my previous videos, you\u2019d know that Vitamin D is technically not even a vitamin, it\u2019s a steroid hormone.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so powerful.\n\nHormones are very powerful and sadly, as stated, most people have sub-optimal levels, which negatively affects your health \u2013 physically, emotionally, mentally, and yes, sexually.\n\nIn regards to Vitamin D and a healthy prostate\u2026 there are human clinical studies that show that taking vitamin D has been shown to decrease prostate volume in BPH patients. These are men who have enlarged prostates or benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\nPre-clinical trials have shown vitamin D to not only decrease BPH cell and prostate cell proliferation alone\u2026 But also when induced by known growth-promoting molecules such as IL-8, Des (1-3) IGF-1, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For Your Prostate?\u2026\n\nThe prostate grows as we get older. Some of it is due to age. Some of it is because of hormones such as DHT and IGF.\n\nVitamin D seems to show benefits for both causes \u2013 aging from cell proliferation and from hormone-induced causes.\n\nWhereas drugs such as finasteride, dutasteride, Proscar, and so forth work from a DHT hormonal method only.\n\nUnfortunately, such drugs also cause erectile problems, while Vitamin D actually helps improve erections.\n\nSimply stated, Vitamin D shows benefits from multiple causes.\n\nAnd the best part is that among all the studies there have not been any side effects or negative implications with increased vitamin D intake.\n\nBest Form & Dose Of Vitamin D For Prostate\n\nNow, the studies showed that the dose of Vitamin D was 6000 units daily.\n\nI\u2019ve always suggested taking between 5000-10,000 units daily. I take 10,000 units myself.\n\nThe correct form of Vitamin D that you should take is Vitamin D3.\n\nAdditionally, vitamin D3 should be taken with another powerful vitamin called Vitamin K2.\n\nThis is because high doses of Vitamin D can cause calcium deposits in the arteries. But taking K2 can help take that calcium and deposit it in the bones, where it\u2019s supposed to go.\n\nNow, I take a supplement called Perfect Vitamin D&K because it has these 2 vitamins in the correct form and dose.\n\nIt\u2019s also a vegan form. The usual Vitamin D comes in gel caps which can have rancid sheep oil.\n\nAll you need is just 1 small capsule daily of Perfect Vitamin D&K. And a bottle will last 3 months, so it\u2019s a great value.\n\nGive it a try to help support healthy prostate function, testosterone, and libido\u2026 in addition to all the other health benefits I mentioned earlier.\n\nImportant \"Increase Your Vitamin D+K\" Shortcut\n\nThere are literally dozens of health benefits when improving your Vitamin D levels ... However, there are two big problems:\n\nProblem #1: About 93% of people are deficient or sub-optimal levels of Vitamin D\n\nProblem #2: Primary way to get Vit D is from 45-60 min of daily sunlight daily (your entire body, not just face or hands)\n\nThis is why its best to take a daily supplement to ensure you have healthy & optimal Vit D levels.\n\nAnd make sure you take Vit D3 with K2 to ensure proper absorption and calcium metabolism for brain & heart health.",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/energy-fatigue/warning-low-acetylcholine-bad-memory-alzheimers-parkinsons/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal how low acetylcholine levels cause brain fog, mental confusion, memory problems, and similar neuro-associative problems.\n\nI\u2019ll also list a number of popular medications that most of us have taken, including myself, that cause a depletion of acetylcholine and thus, cause memory issues.\n\nAnd of course, I\u2019ll give you simple, natural solutions that you can implement today, to help improve your choline levels and thus, improve your mind.\n\nMy Own Struggles With Memory\n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve focused even more on improving my mind and especially my memory.\n\nIn fact, as a child, I\u2019ve always had sub-par memory, at least in school.\n\nGetting all of my degrees and spending over 15+ years at the university was very difficult for me because I\u2019m not good at memorizing things.\n\nAnd unfortunately, that\u2019s what school is mostly about \u2013 memorizing \u201cstuff\u201d, most of which you will rarely ever use.\n\nIn fact, most of my friends in school who did well typically had great memories. Even now, my physician friends can quote crap from years ago to the point that I think, \u201cHOW do you still remember this years later and WHY?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s as if they have some kind of photographic memory or something.\n\nYet, with all that they memorize, most lack common sense and critical thinking.\n\nMy Family History of Memory Problems\n\nAnyway, I mention all of this because I also have a family history of brain health and memory problems.\n\nNow, my mom and, we both have poor memory \u2013 but not my dad. This guy remembers everything \u2013 including silly things going back over 80 years ago.\n\nHowever, after his stroke and in the past 5 years, I can see a very fast decline in his memory. He forgets everything now.\n\nMaybe this is the start of dementia, I\u2019m not sure.\n\nThe good news is that in the past 6 months, I\u2019ve improved his memory a lot, as well as my mom\u2019s \u2026 which I\u2019ll be sharing with you how, so you can do the same in your life.\n\nPlus, how I\u2019ve improved my own memory tremendously over the past decade.\n\nSo, it\u2019s never too late regardless of how old you are.\n\nAcetylcholine \u2013 the Memory Booster & Maker\n\nAcetylcholine is one of the most abundant neurotransmitters in the nervous system. Basically, a \u201cbrain chemical\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s needed to turn short-term memories into long-term ones.\n\nPeople who are deficient in Acetylcholine, have symptoms such as:\n\nFrequently struggle to find the right word.\n\nYou lose your train of thought during conversations.\n\nCan\u2019t recall something you just read.\n\nYou often misplace everyday items like keys, phones, and glasses.\n\nYour overall reaction time is slow.\n\nYou know or suspect that you\u2019ve got ADHD.\n\nYour sense of direction is poor and you frequently get lost.\n\nYou might even crave fatty foods.\n\nMany of the symptoms of acetylcholine deficiency are typical of what we refer to as \u201csenior moments.\u201d\n\nOr, we think it\u2019s just part of aging.\n\nAnd, in fact, they are very similar to those of the early stages of more serious memory problems.\n\nAnd that is no coincidence.\n\nChronic acetylcholine deficiencies are associated with serious neurological disorders.1-3\n\nThe acetylcholine levels of neurological disorders patients can be 90% below what\u2019s considered normal.4\n\nDrugs and Memory Loss\n\nIn fact, memory drugs work on this premise and aim to keep levels of acetylcholine up by blocking its breakdown.\n\nSpeaking of drugs, one reason statin cholesterol-lowering drugs are known to cause memory problems is the decrease in Acetylcholine production AND receptor sensitivity.5-6\n\nThis is also due in part, to the decrease in the production of cholesterol, which is needed for the production of acetylcholine.\n\nStop Taking These \u201cAnti\u201d Acetylcholine Drugs\n\nDrugs that block the action of acetylcholine are known as anticholinergics and are a common cause of acetylcholine deficiency.\n\nA surprising number of drugs fall into this category, both prescription and OTC (over-the-counter).\n\nA good rule of thumb is that any medication that starts with \u201canti\u201d is likely to affect your acetylcholine level.\n\nantihistamines (treatment of allergies)\n\nantihypertensives (blood pressure lowering)\n\nThe symptoms caused by these drugs \u2014 brain fog, mental confusion, and memory loss \u2014 can be so severe that they resemble the symptoms of dementia.\n\nAnd I can guarantee most people listening to this message, have taken at least ONE of these \u201canti\u201d drugs.\n\nFor example, I used to take antihistamines for allergies and I\u2019ve taken antibiotics in the past, as almost all of us have.\n\nOTC Remedies That Affect Acetylcholine Levels\n\nIt\u2019s not just prescription medications that cause acetylcholine deficiency.\n\nSome of the most popular over-the-counter remedies for allergies, insomnia, pain, and acid reflux that affect acetylcholine levels include:7-9\n\nAdvil PM (pain and sleep)\n\nBenadryl (for allergies)\n\nClaritin (for allergies)\n\nDramamine (for motion sickness)\n\nExcedrin PM (for pain and insomnia)\n\nPepcid AC (acid reflux)\n\nSominex (for insomnia)\n\nTagamet (acid reflux)\n\nTylenol PM (for pain and insomnia)\n\nUnisom (for insomnia)\n\nAgain, I can guarantee most people have taken at least one of these drugs.\n\nYears ago I used to take Unisom and Sominex to sleep.\n\nOTC remedies can have long-term consequences, even when taken short term.\n\nFor example, OTC medications like Benadryl significantly increase your risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s after only 60 days of use.10-11\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, is that seniors who use these drugs long-term (for more than 7 years) increase their risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia by 400%.12\n\nSo, What\u2019s The Solution?\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about 3 main solutions.\n\nSo in order to fix and reverse these issues, you FIRST need to eliminate the cause \u2013 which is to NOT use or limit, the use of the drugs I just mentioned.\n\nNext, you want to increase your \u201cgood\u201d fat intake. In fact, some people who have low levels of acetylcholine, ALSO crave more fats.\n\nThis is because the precursor to acetylcholine is choline, a vitamin B complex-related nutrient found mainly in fatty animal foods.\n\nCholine crosses the blood-brain barrier into the brain where it gets converted into acetylcholine.\n\nThe best source of choline by far is egg yolks.13\n\nSo, make sure you eat the WHOLE egg and not just the white.\n\nEat only pasture-raised eggs \u2013 you\u2019ll notice the yolk is a dark orange, not pale yellow.\n\nThe yolk should also be runny. So, soft-boiled is ideal. In fact, I eat them raw.\n\nEat 1-2 eggs daily. And NO, it\u2019s not bad for your cholesterol levels \u2013 in fact, eggs increase your good, HDL lipoprotein cholesterol levels.\n\nFinally, make sure you take supplements. The best combination that\u2019s clinically proven to increase your acetylcholine levels are\n\nAlpha-Glyceryl Phosphoryl Choline (A-GPC)\n\nBacopa extract (50% bacopa glycosides)\n\nTaking choline by itself will help \u2013 but not too much. The MOST effective is A-GPC and the second would be Huperzine and Bacopa extract.\n\nOf course, there are other ingredients for healthy brain health and memory:\n\nMitochondria Optimizers\n\nAnd so forth. Again, I\u2019ve got all the details, the best ingredients, combinations, and formulas. It\u2019s easy to use and convenient.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re having memory problems and other cognitive problems, make sure you improve your acetylcholine levels by\u201d\n\nNOT taking medications that cause depletion\n\nTaking specific supplements that can boosts acetylcholine levels by up to 500% within days\n\nPlease take care of your health \u2013 both physical AND mental.\n\nImportant \"Energy, Memory & Brain Health\" Shortcuts\n\nHere's an important \"fact\" about life - all of us, regardless of age - want MORE energy... Because it positively affects every aspect of our lives (money, leisure, relationships, health, etc.)\n\nAnd as we get older, we also want better memory & brain health...\n\nUnfortunately, even with a great lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) we have LESS energy & WORSE memory simply because of aging, stress and negative changes in our hormones.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"energy, memory & brain health\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3497293/\n\nhttps://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/acetylcholine\n\nhttps://web.williams.edu/imput/synapse/pages/IA5.html\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22688219\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23065075\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2091742\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18510583\n\nhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2010-07-medications-term-cognitive-impairment-aging.html\n\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/288546.php\n\nhttps://medicine.iu.edu/news/2013/05/campbell-boustani/\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/allergies/news/20160509/anticholinergic-drugs-dementia-link#1\n\nhttps://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/report/nutrientsfrm?max=25&offset=0&totCount=0&nutrient1=421&nutrient2=&nutrient3=&subset=0&fg=&sort=c&measureby=m",

    "content": "Today you\u2019ll discover a simple supplement that can help promote:\n\nHealthy triglycerides and blood sugar\n\nReduce your risk for memory loss\n\nHealthy blood flow to your heart, brain, and sex organs\n\nAnd even help reverse grey hair and hair loss.\n\nAnd if you want to improve any of these health topics, make sure to read this article because I\u2019ve got some super easy, simple, and effective natural solutions.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started\u2026\n\nMost clinical studies, drugs, or supplements, are typically done on unhealthy people. Which is fine, but that\u2019s not the best indicator of how to get healthy and stay that way.\n\nUnfortunately, western medicine focuses on the unhealthy, not on what healthy people do to get healthy and more importantly, STAY healthy long-term.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a recent study of healthy people, given a very common and popular herbal supplement that had multiple health benefits\u2026\n\nAnd the best part is that the results happened in just a few weeks\u2026 less than 30 days!\n\nSo, here\u2019s what the study revealed:\n\nLowering of triglycerides \u2013 this is important for anyone concerned about heart and brain health. Plus, if you\u2019re worried about high blood sugar levels. Yes, high triglycerides are directly linked to high blood sugar levels.\n\nBetter digestion of carbohydrates \u2013 which is probably a reason triglycerides improved.\n\nA specific protein that causes plaque buildup in the brain, called Beta Amyloid went down. This is important if you\u2019re concerned about Alzheimer\u2019s, memory loss, and dementia.\n\nNitric Oxide levels went up. This has many important blood flow benefits, such as healthy blood pressure levels, heart function, and for guys, better erections.\n\nLowering of an enzyme called \u201calanine aminotransferase\u201d \u2013 this is important if you\u2019re concerned about white or greying hair. Other studies have shown it can help stop and reverse hair loss.\n\nSo, What\u2019s This Miracle Herbal Supplement Called?\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s Turmeric or Curcumin extract.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already know, curcumin extract gets promoted for its ability to produce lower and healthy inflammation in the body. Which is literally linked to dozens of health problems and aging.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s a term called \u201cINFLAMMaging\u201d because the older we get, there\u2019s more inflammation in the body.\n\nNot only does this mean a ton of health problems, but also joint pain and accelerated aging.\n\nThis is why I spent over $30K dollars for stem cell treatments, which are one of the most potent ways of lowering inflammation throughout the body.\n\nNow, this is why I believe in doing everything to reduce inflammation. The right diet, exercise program, stress management, and yes \u2013 supplements such as curcumin extract.\n\nUnfortunately, most curcumin extract supplements are a waste of money.\n\nThey are poorly absorbed, even when you add in Bioperine, which helps absorption.\n\nWhat Do I Take To Lower Inflammation?\n\nI had to learn this the hard way myself.\n\nThis is why I take a mix or a blend of specific curcumin extracts, such as Curcumin C3 Complex\u00ae / C3 Reduct\u00ae / BCM-95\u00ae Bio-Curcumin\u00ae\n\nThese all have human clinical studies showing that they work.\n\nI also take other herbs that help promote healthy inflammation, in synergy with curcumin extract, such as:\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t expect you to spend extra money and time getting all of these other ingredients. That\u2019s why I take a product called Inflame & Pain Relief, which has all of these in the correct extract dosages.\n\nPlease make sure you take action and not just listen to my words.\n\nInflammation is a huge problem. Taking an easy supplement is fast and very helpful, especially with other lifestyle changes I recommend.\n\nAgain, don\u2019t just passively listen. Be the few who take action and see results.\n\nStress and aging only make things worse. Doing something right now makes tomorrow much better for you.\n\nImportant \"Inflammation & Pain Relief\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for managing inflammation - diet, exercise & stress management being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort... (especially when it comes to pain & joint mobility!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/immune-system/vitamin-k-5-amazing-benefits-5-best-foods/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and in the past few years, Vitamin K has become very popular because it has many important health benefits, that affect your brain, heart and bones.\n\nToday I\u2019ll discuss the 5 primary benefits of Vitamin K and why you should consider taking it.\n\nI\u2019ll also list the top 5 foods that are high in Vitamin K if you don\u2019t want to take the supplemental form in a pill.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve been taking Vitamin K with my vitamin D every morning for over 10+ years now. These two \u201cfat-soluble\u201d vitamins should be taken together because there\u2019s a synergistic effect.\n\nI take Perfect Vitamin D+K because it contains both at the correct dose and form. Just one pill daily and you\u2019re set.\n\nBenefits Of Vitamin K\n\nNow, Vitamin K has many health benefits. Two of the most important and popular ones are:\n\nPromoting healthy bones. It strengthens your bones by helping make osteocalcin, which helps prevent low bone density and thus, can help improve bone density. Which is very important as we age.\n\nAssists with blood clotting. One of vitamin K\u2019s most important jobs is to make four of the 13 proteins needed for blood clotting. Blood clots stop your injuries or wounds from bleeding so they can heal.\n\nBasically, if your blood wouldn\u2019t clot, you would bleed to death in an accident.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s just the start. Vitamin K also helps protect your mind and cognition. It also helps protect the heart, blood vessels, and arteries.\n\nStudies have shown that it may help break down and reduce plaque buildup in the arteries. This means better blood flow and circulation.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Vitamin K is that it helps promote healthy calcium balance. This means more in your bones and less in your arteries.\n\nSimply stated, it helps support bone, cognitive, and heart health.\n\nAs a side warning, if you are currently taking blood-thinning drugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin\u00ae) or anticoagulant medication, please first speak to your doctor before taking Vitamin K.\n\nNow that we know the primary benefits of Vitamin K, let\u2019s talk about the 5 best foods that are the highest in Vitamin K.\n\nKale: 535 mcg for \u00bd cup, cooked\n\nCollard Greens: 530 mcg for \u00bd cup, cooked\n\nSpinach: 444 mcg for \u00bd cup, cooked\n\nTurnip Greens: 425 mcg for \u00bd cup, cooked\n\nBrussels Sprouts: 150 mcg for \u00bd cup, cooked\n\nUnfortunately, these are all foods that I do NOT eat regularly. So, shame on me!!!\n\nHow Much Daily Vitamin K Do You Need?\n\nAs far as how much should you eat and thus, how much vitamin K do you need daily? Luckily, it\u2019s not much.\n\nThe daily adult dose is between 50-150 mcg. So, the average dose is about 100 mcg daily.\n\nRemember, that\u2019s MICRO-gram, not milligrams.\n\nBecause it is fat-soluble, it can be stored in the body. Thus, you don\u2019t have to take it daily.\n\nSo, you can eat \u00bd cup of kale or spinach, 2-3x a week and you\u2019re set.\n\nOr, if you don\u2019t like any of the previously mentioned vegetables, then just take a supplement of 50-100 mcg daily. The most absorbable form is K2\n\nLike I said earlier, I\u2019ve been taking Perfect Vitamin D&K for over a decade.\n\nAs we get older, improving your mind, brain, arteries, blood flow and bones is super important, so please consider adding both Vitamin D and K to your daily supplement plan.\n\nMy Favorite Vitamin For A Healthy Immune System\n\nThe above is a great start. Unfortunately, most people just don't have the time or money to implement the above immune-boosting tactics.\n\nHowever, there is ONE vitamin that is super powerful at promoting a healthy immune system.

    "content": "I want to get right to the point with today\u2019s topic \u2013 if you want to live a healthier and longer life, you MUST have healthy blood pressure. It must be below 120/80 mm/Hg.\n\nThis is because \u201celevated\u201d blood pressure is a primary cause of:\n\nCardiovascular problems\n\nMemory, and cognitive problems\n\n\u2026 and overall health problems\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t care about dying or your health, and you care more about \u201cvanity\u201d \u2013 just know that blood pressure problems are also linked to hair loss and sexual dysfunction.\n\nI bring up today\u2019s topic because, in the past couple of weeks, I\u2019ve had two very close friends of mine lose their fathers. One had a cerebrovascular accident and died within a week. The other had a heart failure and then due to ongoing complications, went to the hospital and then passed away all of a sudden.\n\nBoth happened quickly and were unexpected and it\u2019s been very hard for everyone.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve mentioned in the past that my father had a stroke about 5 years ago. He made a good recovery and was doing well. Even though he moves slower and has a slight limp, his blood pressure had been perfect since.\n\nUnfortunately, about 2 months ago, he had a really bad fall, which is the top 3 causes of death in the elderly. The fall caused a horrible concussion and he was in a coma for a week, then he stayed in the ICU, and then went to rehab, and so forth.\n\nIn the hospital, they didn\u2019t allow any supplements or healthy fats. They gave him horrible food and his blood pressure shot up and making the matter much worse.\n\nAfter two months, he is now back at home. But he has aged like 10 years in just 2 months. It\u2019s been very stressful for everyone, especially for my dad and of course, for my mom.\n\nAnd this is why I just needed to bring up this topic again. It is very important. I want you and your loved ones to be healthy and pay attention to \u201csilent killers\u201d such as blood pressure.\n\nBy the way, all 3 men that I just mentioned \u2013 my dad and my friends\u2019 dads \u2013 did not smoke, weren\u2019t fat, and ate relatively well. My dad did for sure.\n\nBut after a certain age, most people have higher blood pressure.\n\nFor example, \u2153 of people (33%) over the age of 18 are walking around with blood pressure problems and don\u2019t even know it.\n\nThis means over 140/90.\n\nOver 50% of people easily hit these higher numbers at different times of the day.\n\nAnd over 65% of people have \u201celevated\u201d blood pressure, which is between 120-129 systolic.\n\nYes, lifestyle matters for sure.\n\nHowever, it seems that a primary cause is due to the negative changes in your hormones because of AGING.\n\nLook at this graph from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention):\n\nThese numbers are based on having elevated blood pressure and thus, about 140/90 or higher.\n\nBetween the ages of 18-39, about 7.5% of the population has blood pressure problems.\n\nBetween 40-59, it goes up almost 5x to 33%.\n\nAnd over the age of 60, it doubles again to over 63% of the population.\n\nAgain, this does NOT take into account those who have \u201celevated\u201d blood pressure.\n\nMy suggestion is you take this topic very seriously.\n\nYou should purchase a good blood pressure machine to use at home and take your blood pressure throughout the day. See what your levels are and make sure you keep it UNDER 120/80.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve got two important links.\n\nThe first goes to an article I wrote about how my dad supported healthy blood pressure naturally.\n\nAnd the second link goes to another article, \u201cThe Secret To Living Longer, By Supporting Healthy Blood Pressure\u201d\n\nShare this article with anyone you know who should be concerned about their blood pressure. This includes most people over the age of 40.\n\nPlease take a look at both of them or at least just one of them right now, while it\u2019s fresh on your mind.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Pressure\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood pressure is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain, heart, kidney & eye health, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood pressure\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

I have a hard time falling asleep and/or staying asleep. Even as a child.\n\nMy mind is always racing. I\u2019m either working out a problem and looking for solutions. Or, I\u2019m excited about something and I\u2019m thinking about all the possibilities.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m also a very light sleeper, so anything can wake me up or prevent me from falling asleep.\n\nSome people are lucky \u2013 they can sleep anywhere, any time, no matter how noisy, or what\u2019s going on in their life.\n\nI am NOT one of these lucky people and thus, I\u2019ve really had to figure out how to dramatically improve my sleep.\n\nMind you, my sleep is still not great, but it has dramatically improved over the past few years.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started with my favorite solutions for improving your sleep and almost all of these you can implement right away and will cost you not or very little.\n\nKnow Your Sleep Chronotype\n\nMost people say that you should get to bed early and wake up early. This is probably true for many people, but not all. Some people are morning people and some are night owls. Genetics plays a big role in this one. As does aging and hormonal changes.\n\nFor example, I used to stay up late and sleep in. But when I got to my 40s, I started to get to bed earlier. I was getting sleepy earlier. And as I get close to 50, it\u2019s getting even earlier \u2013 like 10 pm.\n\nAnyway, know your genetics and preferences and then stick to it daily.\n\nIf you\u2019re tired at 10 pm, then THAT\u2019S your signal to go to bed.\n\nDon\u2019t push past it and get that \u201csecond wind\u201d because your stress hormones such as cortisol levels will go up and melatonin, you sleep hormone will go down and now you\u2019ve created a negative hormonal balance.\n\nSo, listen to your body and keep the same sleep schedule.\n\nIf you want to go to bed at 2 am, then stick to that schedule every night. Consistency and regularity are the most important.\n\nWake Up With Sunlight\n\nWhen you wake up in the morning, get some sunlight immediately. Let your eyes see sunlight to reset your hormones and \u201cwake up\u201d, which then preps your body to release your sleep hormone, melatonin, at night.\n\nI suggest you just go out for a 10-15 min walk. You get some sun and start your body moving \u2013 double the benefits.\n\nIf any of you have a dog, you know that you need to walk them. Not just so they can go to the bathroom, but so they can get some energy out. It helps them sleep better.\n\nSame with children. One reason they sleep well is that they are so active.\n\nSo, make sure you exercise and move daily. As you may already know, I like BOTH weightlifting resistance exercise and cardio \u2013 walking being my favorite.\n\nYou can do each every other day. Like cardio Mon/Wed/Fri and weights Tues/Thurs/Sat or something similar.\n\nAnd the earlier in the day you exercise, the better. First, you\u2019ll have more energy the entire day.\n\nThe problem is that exercising late in the day, stimulates your nervous system, adrenals, and stress hormones (such as cortisol) and reduces deep sleep.\n\nOf course, I\u2019d rather you exercise late in the day than not exercise at all.\n\nHowever, you can take a nice walk late in the day and that has many benefits, one of them being improving your stress levels.\n\nEat A Healthy and Balanced Diet\n\nThis topic is too big for today\u2019s article but just eat healthily. Make sure you get healthy fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.\n\nDon\u2019t eat too close to bedtime. At least 1-2 hours before. You want your body to focus on repair and sleep, not digesting the food.\n\nYou should also eat something slow to digest for your last meal.\n\nSomething with fat, to keep your blood sugar stable. One reason you wake up at night is due to low blood sugar levels.\n\nSpeaking of which, alcohol is NOT good for sleep.\n\nYou may pass out easier with it, but it reduces deep, REM sleep and thus, the repair is reduced and you wake up less rested.\n\nAnd lastly as far as diet, reduce, or eliminate caffeine.\n\nI know, this means no coffee or energy drinks. However, IF you\u2019re going to have them, cut them out 8-10 hours before bed. When I tell people to do this, they moan at first. However, weeks later they confess how much better they\u2019re sleeping.\n\nDim The Lights \u2013 Especially Blue Light\n\nIt\u2019s important to get sunlight during the day. However, at night, you need to reduce the lights around you.\n\nThis means to dim lights around your home. And more so, kill off the blue light from electronic devices like your phone and computers.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken about this in the past. You can get \u201cblue-blocking\u201d apps on your electronic devices. But, I simply dim all my lights and wear blue-blocking glasses.\n\nI do so about an hour or two before bedtime and it really helps because it tells my body to start producing melatonin.\n\nAll the bright lights trick your brain into thinking it\u2019s still daytime.\n\nBy the way, when it\u2019s time to sleep, your bedroom should be completely pitch black. If you can\u2019t do that, wear eyeshades \u2013 which is what I do.\n\nAs stated earlier, my mind is always racing. I\u2019ve always been a \u201cthinker\u201d. And I\u2019ve noticed many poor sleepers are similar.\n\nYou might have concern or anger or frustration or worry or even excitement. Whatever it is, your brain is constantly focusing on something and not able to relax.\n\nHowever, I think writing things down is really important because it gets the junk out of your head. You can journal or have a diary or just write down what\u2019s bothering you.\n\nThen, make sure you also end on a positive note \u2013 what are you grateful for?\u2026\n\nWhat are you happy about?\u2026\n\nWhat IS working out in your life?\u2026 Small or big, end with gratitude.\n\nJust know that your brain can only hold on to ONE type of emotion.\n\nYou can\u2019t be angry AND grateful at the same time. So, better to end the day with happiness, on a positive note of gratitude.\n\nIronically, you\u2019ll also get better sleep again, due to better hormones.\n\nTake Specific Supplements To Relax\n\nFinally, make sure you take some supplements that help you relax at night.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, we live in a high-stress world. We are getting bombarded with so many stimuli all day long, it\u2019s hard to physically and more so, mentally relax.\n\nThese are in fact, specific ingredients that I use to help me sleep. It\u2019s been a big game-changer for me. This combination works the best and here\u2019s the exact formula I use.\n\nThe end result is BETTER, deeper sleep, and you\u2019ll wake up feeling rested and youthful.\n\nImportant \"Deep Quality Sleep\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few ways for improving your sleep - diet, exercise & stress management - all being important lifestyle factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take lots of time & effort and most people want faster results, with less effort... (especially with sleep!)\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve \"deep quality sleep\" with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "The other day I got an email from Josephine and she asked:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam \u2013 I got off the cholesterol-lowering drugs (I felt HORRIBLE on them!!!) and I\u2019ve been using your CholesLo now for 6 months. My Cholesterol levels went from 227 down to 191. This is a good start, thank you. How do I get it below 150? Should I increase the dosage?\u201d\n\nSo the problem here is that many people, including doctors \u2026 try to really lower their cholesterol as much as possible.\n\nFor example, I have a friend whose cholesterol is 121 and his doctor is happy with this.\n\nHowever, this is crazy and it explains why my friend is depressed, has lost muscle, has memory problems, and has no sex drive.\n\nCholesterol is GOOD for you. It has many health benefits. In fact, \u201clow\u201d cholesterol, which I think is anything less than 150\u2026 is linked to:\n\nMemory loss and Alzheimer\u2019s disease4\n\nDepression and an increase in suicide rates1,2\n\nIncrease your risk for mental health problems3\n\n\u201cLow drive\u201d \u2013 physical, sexual, and emotional.5\n\nSo here\u2019s what you want:\n\nHealthy cholesterol levels \u2014 between 150 to 220. I know everyone tries to get it below 200, but it\u2019s okay to be a little \u201chigher\u201d. The ideal range is about 170-190.\n\nOptimal HDL/LDL ratios \u2014 What you should care more about is your \u201cgood\u2019 HDL and \u201cbad\u201d LDL levels. These are known as lipoproteins \u2014 fats combined with proteins. And your goal is to have higher HDL and lower \u201csmall density\u201d LDL particles.\n\nLower Triglycerides \u2014 Simply stated this is \u201cfat in the blood\u201d. A little bit of \u201cfat\u201d is normal for energy, but too much and things start to \u201cclog\u201d up in your arteries.\n\nLower Homocysteine \u2014 This is an amino acid in your blood and it\u2019s a major risk factor for heart problems. Most doctors, especially in the US, still don\u2019t test for this. But for sure you want this lower.\n\nHealthy Liver Function \u2014 most people don\u2019t know, but almost 80% of your cholesterol is formed in your liver, NOT from the foods you eat. So you want to make sure your liver is clean, strong, and healthy.\n\nSo, total cholesterol is just ONE factor for having \u201chealthy lipid\u201d levels.\n\nAnd again, you don\u2019t want it too low, which is why drugs just make this situation much worse. They are too powerful and just shut down everything.\n\nAdditionally, the other 4 factors I mentioned when combined with healthy cholesterol levels, DRAMATICALLY reduce your risk for heart problems \u2014 and THAT\u2019S the secret!\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nPsychosomatic Medicine 2000;62\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5635a2.htm\n\nhttp://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/short/50/5/409\n\nhttp://www.alz.org/we_can_help_cholesterol.asp\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1884568\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/homocysteine-risk\n\nhttp://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/04/20/cholesterol-myths.aspx",

    "title": "Using Transmagnetic Stimulation for Depression | Dr. Sam Robbins",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mood-happiness-se/using-transmagnetic-stimulation-for-depression/",
    "content": "Transmagnetic stimulation or Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a fairly straightforward procedure that is designed to stimulate the nerve cells in the brain in order to counteract the effects of depression. Usually, this is not used until other treatments for depression have been tried and not worked.\n\nTMS is fairly new to the scene as it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008. Although there have been numerous studies that have demonstrated the overall effects of this treatment, there are still questions as to the long-term effect which will take years to fully understand.\n\nHow Transmagnetic Stimulation is Applied\n\nTMS uses an electromagnetic coil that is placed against the scalp near the forehead. When switched on the nerve cells in the brain are affected which control mood and depression symptoms. The treatments do not require the use of other drugs or stimulants and the overall effect can vary from patient to patient, although it is generally mild in nature.\n\nDespite years of study, how TMS works to relieve depression is still not fully understood. The theory is that the magnetic pulses it sends out stimulate the nerve cells that are at the center of the mood control for your mind. The stimulation appears to impact how this part of the brain is functioning and may improve the overall mood and ease the symptoms of depression.\n\nIt is true that transmagnetic is the least invasive of all brain stimulation procedures to treat depression when compared to deep brain or vagus nerve stimulation treatments. There is no need for surgery or electrodes being implanted as well. Plus, it differs from electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) because it does not cause seizures or require being fully sedated.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that transmagnetic stimulation is without side effects or risks.\n\nThe Side Effects of TMS\n\nMost of the side effects caused by transmagnetic stimulation are relatively minor and after a few treatments will tend to disappear as the body gets used to the effects.\n\nSpasms of the Facial Muscles\n\nDiscomfort at the Site of the Stimulation\n\nDiscomfort from the Noise during Stimulation\n\nThese are the most common symptoms which are somewhat rare. However, there are more serious systems that are very rare, but have been documented to happen in certain patients from the effects of the treatment.\n\nHearing Loss from Inadequate Protection.\n\nMania mostly in people from bi-polar disorder.\n\nPlus, it must be noted that there has been no study for long term effects simply because not enough time has passed to know what they might be. As it is, transmagnetic therapy has been known to work in patients who have tried and failed in other treatments while only having mild side effects.\n\nFor those who have used standard talk or drug therapies, transmagnetic stimulation certain offers the promise of affecting the brain cells that control mood directly and having a greater impact overall than previous treatments.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

In addition, more than half the people who suffer from depression at any point in their lives will have a relapse at a later point.\n\nHowever, it is not actually the lack of folate, but the inability of the body to transform it into L-methylfolate that can cause many of the symptoms of depression that millions of people will experience. Understanding the link between L-methylfolate and depression has led to new research which has allowed for the artificial production of this substance as an effective treatment.\n\nWhat is L-Methylfolate?\n\nBasically, this is the form of folate that is transformed by the body so that it can pass into the brain and help it create the necessary chemicals to keep it properly balanced. Quite often, depression is caused by the lack of important chemicals like serotonin which help keep the brain functioning properly. Unfortunately, since the body will not convert the folate in certain people, an artificially developed form of L-methylfolate has been created which can be absorbed from the bloodstream and into the brain.\n\nIn addition, because this is actually a natural product there are no side effects associated with taking L-methylfolate. Plus, it can be found over the counter and is very inexpensive when compared to many traditional antidepressant drugs.\n\nBasically, L-methylfolate crosses over the blood-brain barrier to help the neurotransmitter synthesis and indirectly create serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine which helps regulate the mood of the brain to help keep depression symptoms in check. There have been many studies to show that L-methylfolate will help restore the brain to its proper function the same way that serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors do.\n\nThere have been many different studies and research on this substance which has helped change the prescriptions for many people suffering from depression. While it does not work in all cases, it does have a powerful influence on the brain which helps to balance out the chemicals that are produced. Essentially, in people who cannot properly absorb folate and change it over to L-methylfolate so that the brain can benefit, they are highly likely to suffer from symptoms of depression.\n\nThis means that now people who notice and report the symptoms of depression to their doctor can have their folate level checked to see if their bodies are making the conversion. If not, then they can be offered this very inexpensive treatment which may have a substantial effect on their depression symptoms. The effects from the substance are usually felt rather quickly, although enough will have to be absorbed into the brain for it to start making a big difference.\n\nNaturally, other tests will have to be performed and L-methylfolate may not be the answer. But it is inexpensive and it causes no side effects which makes it the seemingly perfect answer for many people who may be suffering from depression do their body\u2019s inability to properly convert folate.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "For those who are fighting the effects of depression, there are certainly many natural substances and methods that can be used to help restore balance in the mind and body. One of the most ancient methods is called mudras. For thousands of years, mudras have been used to help people focus, meditate and ultimately combat the effects of illness to the body which includes depression.\n\nBut what are mudras and how exactly can they be used to help fight the effects of depression?\n\nMudras are selected hand positions that create a number of benefits for the mind and body. A mudra is a particular hand position in which the energies of the body are directed to help fight the effects of a number of ailments. Depression is one of the most common ailments that mudras were meant to combat.\n\nEssentially, a person who is suffering from depression should first see their doctor to ensure that all aspects of the condition can be treated and then they should incorporate mudras into their treatment options.\n\nHow to Use Mudras to Fight Depression\n\nThere are many different hand and arm positions that can be used to direct the energies of the body and mind to help restore the proper balance. What is important is to incorporate the right type of meditational practices as well to help advance the effects of the mudras.\n\nThis means that you should start in a comfortable position either sitting or standing depending on the specific type of mudra that is being performed. Once comfortable, the mudra should be held for a few minutes or a little longer in order for the body to reap the full effects. You can focus on a few mudras or use several over the course of a day.\n\nThere are mudras designed for all types of effects, but you will want to focus on those that are specifically designed to relieve the effects of depression. For the most part, these will be mudras where you position the fingers and thumb on one hand in a specific way while holding your arm in the proper position. Plus, breathing is very important as well which helps conduct the flow of blood so that you can really enjoy the effect of the mudra that is being performed.\n\nMudras and Other Depression Treatments\n\nBecause mudras use no drugs or cause any harmful effects to the body, they can be successfully incorporated with other treatments that can help accelerate the process of restoring balance. You should consider that mudras work best when combined with healthy eating, exercise and taking the right set of vitamins, minerals and amino acids which help the body restore itself to its normal state.\n\nMudras have helped millions of people cope and overcome all types of conditions over thousands of years, including depression. For those who are interested in treating the symptoms of depression in a safe, natural way, mudras offer the means by which you can restore the natural balance in your body.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "Both Adderall and Concerta are drugs used to combat the effects of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). In addition, they have properties that are designed to stimulate part of the brain that is responsible for being focused and paying attention to details. However, while each drug is similar in its direction, they are made from different ingredients to achieve that effect.\n\nUnderstanding Adderall and Concerta\n\nEssentially, Concerta is the equivalent of methylphenidate while Adderall is the combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. While different in makeup, both drugs do have roughly the same effect on a person who suffers from ADHD. In addition, each drug reduces hyperactivity and impulsive actions while affecting the central nervous system. So, a person who suffers from ADHD is less likely to fidget or move about impulsively while taking either one of these drugs.\n\nAlso, both drugs are taken in tablet form for immediate or extended duration. This means that the drug can be taken either once in the morning for all day relief or during times which your symptoms may arise unexpectedly. In addition, both drugs can be addicting, so careful monitoring of the dosages are needed to ensure that becoming hooked on the drugs do not occur.\n\nA common side effect in children is that both drugs can actually slow their growth. This means that your doctor will have to monitor their growth to ensure that they grow normally over time. If there are indications that the growth has slowed or stopped, they may take the child off the drugs until a normal growth pattern develops again. The functions of the heart as well as blood pressure may be affected as well, so frequent checks will be needed.\n\nThe side effects for both drugs are somewhat similar as well. Shortness of breath, chest pains, fainting, auditory hallucinations, and increasing violent thoughts are rare, but documented side effects of each drug. More common, though less serious side effects include headache, dry mouth, dizziness and the like.\n\nThe Differences Between Adderall and Concerta\n\nTo date, there have been no official studies that have directly compared the effects of Adderall and Concerta in terms of their treatment of ADHD. While both drugs are made from different elements, they seemingly have very similar effects on the brain which allows those with ADHD to calm down and focus on the tasks at hand. It will take several years before conclusive studies can be made to determine which is the more effective drug.\n\nIf there is one difference, it is that the extended release version of Adderall is more expensive than the Concerta counterpart. However, the generic version of Adderall is less expensive than the generic Concerta, so choosing which one based on price brings advantages and disadvantages depending on the use.\n\nOverall, Concerta might be a better choice than Adderall for those with heart issues or mental illnesses who simply cannot take Adderall in any form. However, it must be noted that everyone has different reactions to prescribed drugs so choosing the right one may take a little trial and error before making the final choice.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

These are people who have trouble concentrating or controlling their impulses to the point where they may become excitable and fidgety which actually reduces their ability to focus on any particular thing.\n\nAlthough we mostly associate ADHD with children, adults can suffer from this condition as well which may last the rest of their lives. In fact, 50% of children who have been diagnosed with ADHD will carry the symptoms well into their adult years.\n\nInterestingly enough, both Adderall and Ritalin are stimulants which may seem counterproductive, the actual effect is one that brings people to focus better on tasks and improves their overall concentration. In addition, the use of stimulants also reduces impulse behaviors as well.\n\nSimilarities Between Adderall and Ritalin\n\nBoth medications are similar in the sense that they affect the central nervous system by speeding up the transmission of chemical and electrical signals which in turn increases brain activity. The result is that the person taking the medications can really focus on the tasks at hand. In addition, both medications have similar side effects as well which include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nIn addition, both drugs are available in both short and long acting formulas. Plus, both fall under the US Controlled Substance Act which means that they can be addictive as well with a strong potential for abuse if they are not well monitored.\n\nDifferences Between Adderall and Ritalin\n\nWhen it comes to substantial differences between Adderall and Ritalin there are very few. After several studies examining the effectiveness of both drugs, there has not been any conclusive evidence that one works better than the other. In fact, they are both enough alike that many doctors will quickly recommend the drug not prescribed if they one that was originally selected is not working as it should.\n\nHowever, there are some minor differences which have been noticed over the years that they both have gone into effect. Adderall actually increase the cells ability to pump out neurotransmitters which is something that Ritalin does not do. This means that Adderall is actually effective for longer periods of time which may make it seem more effective. However, Ritalin seems to be the drug of choice for those who want a better, short-term effect because they can control the side effects to a greater extent. This means that a person taking Ritalin is less likely to experience long term side effects such as loss of appetite or not being able to sleep well so that they can eat properly and get a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nOverall, the drug that works best for the person who has ADHD is the one that offers the greatest positive effect with the least number of side effects. For many adults, Ritalin may be the proper choice because its effects can be better controlled while children who are in school for seven or eight hours a day may benefit from Adderall for its longer-term effects.\n\nThere are a few important ways for reducing \"negative emotions\" - diet, exercise and \"mental outlook\" being important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nOn the other hand, prescription drugs work \"fast\", but they're addictive and have lots of negative side effects.\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself.

    "content": "Caffeine is a part of our daily lives from the beverages we consume as well as chocolates and other food items. This particular stimulant is found in some of the medicines that are taken such as pain killers and has proven to be an effective way to rev up the body in the morning to take on work or other activities.\n\nResearch has shown that caffeine not only stimulates the nervous system, but is also psychoactive as well which means it can boost the mental processes of the brain. There are plenty of antioxidants in caffeine that protect the body from free radicals which cause premature damage to the skin, hair and nails.\n\nHowever, like any stimulant there are positive and negative effects that caffeine provides in the body. Here are the pros and cons of caffeine which will help you decide the amount, if any, that you should consume during the day.\n\n1. Energy Caffeine will raise the energy level of the body and mind on a temporary basis as well as making you more alert. The alertness also comes with the ability to concentrate better and stay more focused on the task at hand. However, it must be noted that it will not improve your memory, so you are better off taking a nap.\n\n2. Reduced Risk of Type 2 Diabetes & Parkinson\u2019s Disease Studies have shown that caffeine has a positive effect on the sugar levels in the blood stream which may actually reduce the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. Plus, research has also indicated that those who consume caffeine regularly are less likely to lose the brain cells that transmit dopamine which in turn means that the effects to the motor systems that are run by the brain are less vulnerable to Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nHowever, not everything caffeine does for the body is good. While consuming moderate amounts of caffeine can be tolerated by the body with few noticeable side effects, if you take in more you do run the risk of suffering from more serious side effects that may affect your health.\n\n1. Headaches, Irritability, and Anxiousness This is arguably the most common effect from consuming too much caffeine. The stimulation to the nervous system is such that you will feel nervous and twitchy until the caffeine has left the body.\n\n2. Fast or Irregular Heartbeat This is a more dangerous symptom, especially if you are suffering from heart disease or a higher risk of heart attacks.\n\n3. Insomnia Another common side effect of consuming too much caffeine. It is recommended that you do not consume any caffeine just before dinner time in order to allow it to leave your body so that you can get a full night\u2019s sleep.\n\n4. Muscle Twitches This is a rather annoying effect of caffeine when too much is consumed as the twitches can disrupt your concentration.\n\nStudies have also shown that heavy caffeine consumption may lead to bone loss in postmenopausal women as well as increase the chance for miscarriages. Pregnant women are recommended not to consume more than 200mg of caffeine each day.\n\nAll in all, caffeine has mostly positive effects on the body, but it must be taken in moderate amounts in order to get the benefits without the issues.",

    "content": "For years, the Food and Drug Administration has been comparing Medicare patients who have been using Pradaxa and Coumadin or Wafarin as it is often called in terms of their risk factors. Basically, many of the risks that those taking either drug includes bleeding in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, bleeding in the brain and even death. The seriousness of the side effects being studied is rare, but they are such that the consequences have been paramount for those taking the drugs.\n\nIn one study, over 134,000 Medicare patients who were at least 65 years old and using both products showed that there were significant differences between both. Those who used Pradaxa were shown to have lower cases of brain bleeding, clot-related strokes, and dying prematurely as compared with Coumadin. However, the risk of MI was determined to be similar for both drugs.\n\nIn making a direct comparison, Pradaxa did have an increase of bleeding in the GI as compared to Coumadin which has certainly garnered the interest of the scientific community because such bleeding may be difficult to detect or discern from other conditions. The studies have also shown that the risks to those who take Pradaxa actually increase with age, although both drugs do have their own case of side effects. In fact, new users of Pradaxa have shown fewer cases of GI bleeding or internal hemorrhages based in part upon their younger age. Those who are entering their 60s seem to do better than those who are in there 70s or 80s.\n\nWhat has also been found is that such cases of bleeding are less prevalent amount Pradaxa users as opposed to Coumadin if they had just started taking the drug and were in their mid-60s. The FDA is committed to further studies and investigations to track the location and differences in any bleeding or abnormality. In this manner, further differences between the drugs will be understood.\n\nWhat Does Pradaxa Treat?\n\nCurrently, Pradaxa actually reduces the risk of systemic embolism and stroke in non-valve atrial fibrillation cases, pulmonary embolism as well as treatment of deep-vein thrombosis. The ability of Pradaxa to reduce this risk is has led to its further use for patients who are also taking a parenteral anticoagulant for the past five to ten days. This is to reduce the reoccurrences of PE and DVT.\n\nTreatment with Coumadin\n\nCoumadin is used to treat pulmonary embolism, thrombosis and thromboembolic complications due to atrial fibrillation. In addition, this treatment is also used for cardiac valve replacement to help reduce the risk of premature death from occurring.\n\nIt is clear that both drugs have benefits and side effects that will need to be carefully monitored. The differences between them are relatively small and will depend in large part on the age, health and wellbeing of the patient. While studies will continue with both drugs for the foreseeable future, any differences between them are really based more on the condition of the patient and the particular issues that they may be facing in the near future.",

    "content": "Each of these drugs is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Each of these drugs uses different ingredients and has a different effect on the body and mind, so there are substantial differences between the two. However, both are designed to increase the neurotransmitters in the brain to help improve focus and concentration levels while reducing hyperactive behavior.\n\nAdderall was first released in 2001 with Vyvanse being released in 2007 both with FDA approval. Both drugs are designed for children ages 6 years and up. Plus, those with heart issues or taking MAOI inhibitor medicines should avoid either drug.\n\nChoosing between these two drugs can be difficult despite their different origins simply because their overall effect is the same. However, understanding the differences can help when decided which one to choose first and if the other makes for a good alternative in case the first does not work out.\n\nSimilarities and Differences\n\nBoth Adderall and Vyvanse are amphetamines which are stimulants to the nervous system. While it may seem strange at first to provide stimulants to a child that is hyperactive, the effect is to stimulate the neurotransmitters located in the brain such as dopamine and norepinephrine which in turn help the child to focus better and stay calmer since more of their brain is now being accessed to help them learn and to stay calm.\n\nArguably the biggest differences between the drugs apart from their chemical compound are how the body breaks each one of them down to their components for use. Vyvanse was created in part because of the more addictive nature of Adderall and is often the first choice of physicians because of its less addictive effects.\n\nAnother difference is how the drugs are taken. Adderall comes in two types of does that includes a tablet taken two to three times per day and an extended capsule which will last for up to 12 hours and can be used in place of the tablets. Vyvanse is a single capsule taken in the morning which slowly becomes active during the day and will last for up to 14 hours. The addiction risk for Vyvanse is considerably less than Adderall because of the very slow way that it is absorbed into the body.\n\nPublished studies of both drugs indicate that there is relatively little difference in terms of their effectiveness. However, it must be noted that everyone reacts differently to each drug, so there will be those who react to one better than the other. The risk is that Adderall may be easier to become addicted and thus makes it harder to wean the patient from the drug itself.\n\nAdderall is cheaper and comes in a generic form arguably because it has been around longer, so Vyvanse will also reach that stage at some point. Both drugs have very similar side effects which affect a small minority of users. You will need to talk to your physician about which drug to use first which may be Vyvanse simply because it is far less addicting than Adderall. However, it may be that Vyvanse does not have the same beneficial effects, so discussion with your doctor is most important in this matter.",
