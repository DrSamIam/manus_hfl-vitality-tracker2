    "content": "Exercise can increase OR decrease testosterone levels.\n\nToday it\u2019s 2025, and I\u2019ll reveal which exercises are good and bad for your testosterone levels, and ultimately, what\u2019s the best exercise for boosting testosterone levels.\n\nWhat Exercises Increase Testosterone Levels?\n\nMost guys ask how to boost testosterone through exercise, but let\u2019s start with what doesn\u2019t work \u2014 cardio.\n\nExcessive cardio can actually lower testosterone levels, especially when paired with poor recovery.\n\nWhy Lifting Weights Works\n\nThe best way to naturally boost testosterone is by lifting weights.\n\nBut it\u2019s not about long workouts. In fact, training for hours can increase cortisol and destroy testosterone.\n\nOptimal Training Duration\n\nStick to 20\u201345 minutes per session. Max one hour.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the gym for 90 minutes or more, you\u2019re either doing too much volume, resting too long, or wasting time talking.\n\nLift weights 3\u20135 times per week.\n\nMore than that leads to elevated stress hormones and drops in testosterone.\n\nIf you\u2019re training six or seven days a week, you\u2019re overdoing it.\n\nThe Problem With Overtraining\n\nI used to train excessively, thinking more was better.\n\nOver time, I lost strength and muscle.\n\nMy mood, sleep, and libido tanked \u2014 all signs of low testosterone and high cortisol.\n\nI even became skinny-fat, losing muscle and gaining fat.\n\nPeople say Arnold Schwarzenegger trained for hours a day.\n\nThat may be true \u2014 he had great genetics and used steroids.\n\nBut today, even he works out about 45 minutes daily, targeting one body part at a time.\n\nHe admits he overtrained and now focuses on recovery and joint health.\n\nHow to Lift for Testosterone\n\nKeep workouts intense, focused, and under an hour.\n\nLeave the gym feeling energized, not exhausted. You should feel like you could\u2019ve done a bit more \u2014 not like you\u2019ve been hit by a truck.\n\nI used to leave the gym shaking from fatigue, thinking I was growing.\n\nIn reality, I was burning out. I lost muscle and motivation. Learn from my mistakes.\n\nEmpirical Evidence Over Studies\n\nClinical studies are helpful, but real-world results matter more.\n\nMost studies last 6 weeks \u2014 not enough time to see long-term effects.\n\nYou can push hard for 6 weeks, but you need a routine that works for 6 months\u2026 or 6 years.\n\nLift weights 3\u20135 times a week\n\nKeep workouts under an hour\n\nFocus on recovery and consistency\n\nDon\u2019t overtrain or rely on cardio\n\nFocus on long-term habits, not short bursts of intensity.\n\nConsistent action beats perfection.\n\nCommit, fine-tune, and stay on track. That\u2019s how you reach your fitness and hormone goals.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss/how-to-permanently-erase-your-love-handles/",
    "content": "I received a question the other day stating:\n\n\u201cDr. Sam, how do I get rid of my \u201clove handles\u201d? Is there a way to do it permanently? It always seems to be there, no matter what I do and I\u2019ve tried everything.\u201d\n\nWell, first of all \u2013 I can guarantee that you haven\u2019t \u201ctried everything\u201c.\n\nAnd yes, there is a way to permanently remove and \u201cerase\u201d your love handles and I\u2019ll tell you how in a couple of minutes.\n\nThe love-handles are seen in both men and women, but typically more in men.\n\nIt\u2019s that fat on the side/back of your lower abs.\n\nThey\u2019re on top of the external oblique muscles, located right above the hip bone.\n\nWhich, incidentally, most people make a huge mistake by training the oblique muscles thinking that by working them and so forth, they\u2019ll somehow burn more fat in the area. Some kind of \u201cspot reduction\u201d technique or strategy.\n\nA lot of so-called experts and trainers keep telling people to do this and it\u2019s just a stupid idea. Your oblique muscles can grow quickly and thus, they\u2019ll just get bigger and wider when you train them.\n\nYou do NOT want that.\n\nYou want to narrow your waistline, NOT make it bigger and wider\u2026 even if it\u2019s muscle.\n\nThis means no side-bends. No weights, no dumbbells, no cables, no planks \u2014 nothing!\n\nAdditionally, doing heavy squats and deadlifts also activates the oblique muscles and thus, builds them.\n\nThis is great for performance and stability, but not for aesthetics and having a tight, narrow waist.\n\nSimply doing regular ab work that focuses primarily on the rectus abdominis, the front of your abs, top to bottom, is all that\u2019s needed. You\u2019ll indirectly tighten the oblique muscles, without building them and making them big and blocky.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s move on and talk about how to get rid of the love handles.\n\nI don\u2019t know why they\u2019re called the \u201clove handles\u201d, but let\u2019s just call it what it really is \u2013 fat!\n\nAnd to shrink your love handles, you need to lose fat.\n\nBefore I start discussing fat loss, there\u2019s a definite hormonal relationship to stomach fat, including the love handles.\n\nI had a very good friend growing up and he was very lean everywhere. A skinny guy. But it seemed that ALL of his fat went right to his stomach and the majority of it, to the love handles.\n\nSome people distribute fat evenly throughout the body. Some more on the lower body and some more on the upper body.\n\nOr look at women for example. When they go through menopause, their fat distribution changes and it starts to go more towards the gut, belly, and \u201clove handles\u201d.\n\nIt has to do with genetics and hormones.\n\nNow, you can\u2019t change your genetics, but you most certainly can make improvements in your hormones, which will help accelerate fat loss around the stomach and love-handles.\n\nThis is why some people follow the wrong diet or exercise program and they lose \u201cweight\u201d, but it\u2019s not that much fat. It\u2019s water and muscle weight. They end up looking \u201cskinnier\u201d, but not much leaner.\n\nAnd I mention this because there are a few hormones I want you to focus on that control stomach fat.\n\nThere are other hormones and peptides of course, such as Growth Hormone, IGF, etc. but I want to keep it simple today.\n\nCortisol is one of your stress hormones. You need it to survive but most people overproduce this hormone.\n\nWe live in stressful times. Too much is going on all at once. We don\u2019t \u201cstop and relax,\u201d and we sleep poorly.\n\nAs cortisol levels go up, fat storage in the belly also goes up.1,2\n\nInterestingly, people who have large waists in proportion to their hips, especially women, have been found to secrete more cortisol, especially during stressful times.3\n\nAdditionally, higher cortisol causes two other negative reactions in the body.\n\nIt lowers testosterone levels.\n\nIt decreases insulin sensitivity and increases blood sugar and insulin levels.\n\nBoth of these hormonal imbalances cause further fat storage around the belly.\n\nWhile at the same time, it DECREASES muscle mass and thus, further decreasing your metabolism.\n\nSimply stated, you\u2019re really screwed!\n\nOne of the best ways to improve cortisol levels is to get better and deeper sleep. I will do an entire article about this topic in the future.\n\nBut you must manage your stress levels better.\n\nThis also means you don\u2019t go crazy with the workouts. Exercising every day and pushing hard all the time \u2013 doing super intense gym workouts AND cardio and so forth \u2013 is very stressful for your body. You\u2019re creating a hormonal imbalance and a very negative one.\n\nSo, listen to your body and know when you need to pull back and relax and let the mind and body recover.\n\nNOTE: If you are dealing with extra stress (life, money, relationships, poor sleep, etc.) you can take specific herbs to lower cortisol and help fix this problem.\n\nThe next hormone I want you to focus on is insulin. This is a storage hormone that gets produced to lower high blood sugar levels.\n\nJust like cortisol, you need it to survive. But, it shouldn\u2019t be elevated all the time.\n\nHigh insulin and blood sugar levels cause more belly fat, including the most harmful kind \u2013 visceral fat \u2013 which is the fat inside your organs in the stomach. It causes the protruding, pregnant belly.\n\nSo, you must manage your insulin levels and this has a lot to do with your diet. This doesn\u2019t mean you never eat carbohydrates.\n\nYou should have some carbs, but not a ton of it and more importantly, not the wrong kinds.\n\nFirst off: don\u2019t drink your calories. It shoots up your blood sugar and insulin levels.\n\nEat natural, healthy carbs \u2013 vegetables, some fruit, small amounts of starches like white rice, yams, and legumes.\n\nAlso, reduce seed and vegetable oils. They can cause hormonal imbalances, insulin resistance, and inflammation.\n\nThis means oils such as soybean, canola, corn, sunflower, sesame, and so forth.\n\nNOTE: If you are dealing with high blood sugar or want to enjoy eating your carbs, you can use specific herbs to help lower blood sugar levels.\n\nTestosterone is found in both men and women, just at much higher levels in men.\n\nAs men\u2019s testosterone levels decrease, starting in his mid-20s, his body fat starts to increase.\n\nIn fact, there is a direct and strong correlation between testosterone and stomach fat.4-7\n\nMore testosterone = less stomach fat.\n\nHigher testosterone also means a better ratio to cortisol, the stress hormone.\n\nAs a reminder, the opposite of testosterone is NOT the female hormone, estrogen \u2013 but the stress hormone, cortisol (which I mentioned above).\n\nHigher testosterone helps fight the negative effects of cortisol.\n\nNOTE: If you want to improve your hormones to build more muscle, reduce belly fat and have better erections, you can take specific herbs that help increase testosterone levels.\n\nSo, you need to improve your hormones, which have to do with your lifestyle. This means:\n\nNow, there are supplements, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and herbs that will help make improvements in these hormones. Some are very effective and powerful.\n\nHOWEVER, nothing is as important as diet, exercise, and stress management.\n\nThe supplements will accelerate the process and the truth is, they all work very well together.\n\nThere\u2019s never ONE simple solution or magic bullet or pill.\n\nWhat matters is persistence, consistency, determination, and making a commitment that you\u2019re going to make daily improvements, week after week, month after month, and year after year to get in shape and stay that way.\n\nIf you have bad days, no problem. Just start over again the next day. It\u2019s totally fine.\n\nBest Supplements For Fat Loss\n\nHere are the best supplements for depending on your needs:\n\nIncreasing testosterone.\n\nHowever, if your goal is purely weight loss and appetite reduction, you can try this.\n\nOh, I almost forgot about the permanent way to erase your love handles. The truth is, there\u2019s really only one main way and that\u2019s through liposuction.\n\nThey actually remove the fat cells and thus, it\u2019s permanent.\n\nThere are a couple of injectable drugs that will cause similar effects, but that topic is far too advanced for me to speak about here. Plus, it these drugs have a lot of negative effects.\n\nSo, if all else fails, you may want to consider liposuction at some point. However, there are no shortcuts if you want healthy and long-term fat loss.\n\nJust take action daily and soon, you\u2019ll achieve your goals.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15044359\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18984030\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16353426\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1778664\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418719\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24407187\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20448541",

    "title": "\ud83d\udc4cWant A Flat Stomach? - 2 Foods To Avoid In 2025",
    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss/2-foods-to-avoid-if-you-want-a-flat-stomach/",
    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and most of us want a flat stomach, regardless of age. Now, guys may also want some added muscle definition, like \u201c6-pack abs\u201d as well.\n\nBut at the very least, in clothing, everyone wants a flat stomach and this can only happen when you lose stomach fat (subcutaneous and visceral).\n\nSadly, as we get older, the stomach gets bigger and weaker.\n\n3 Main Types Of Belly Fat\n\nWe have more subcutaneous fat \u2013 that\u2019s the fat under the skin. This is what most of us see and can grab.\n\nThen we have visceral fat, that\u2019s the fat inside and around the organs. This fat you don\u2019t see. Unfortunately, visceral fat is much more unhealthy than subcutaneous fat. Visceral fat is also the kind that gives you that pregnant, bear-belly look \u2013 even if you can\u2019t grab or pinch very much subcutaneous fat.\n\nLastly, we have poor muscular development. Either very weak abdominal muscles that can\u2019t hold the stomach back and flat. OR on the other side, people who do the WRONG ab exercises, which build big, bulky abdominal muscles, or the wrong exercises, which work the psoas muscles \u2013 which again, push OUT the abdominal wall.\n\nOn a side note, genetics aside, hormones play a MAJOR role in fat distribution, especially in the stomach. Hence, why men typically have more belly fat.\n\nAnd this is why post-menopausal women have more stomach fat all of a sudden.\n\nToday I\u2019m going to only discuss the types of foods that typically cause a bigger stomach \u2013 either building too much subcutaneous or visceral fat\u2026 or both at the same time.\n\nAnd these foods are the ones that negatively affect the hormones, that cause subcutaneous and/or visceral fat.\n\nSo, the good news is that by avoiding or reducing these foods, you\u2019ll improve your hormones and thus, decrease your belly fat and flatten your stomach.\n\nOf course, the simple fact of creating a calorie deficit \u2013 meaning, burning more calories than you consume, will decrease belly fat.\n\nBut that aside, some foods are just really bad.\n\nSelect Proper Carbs For A Flat Stomach\n\nNote, I did NOT say to get rid of carbs, or go on a low-carb diet or keto or carnivore diet. And I\u2019ll tell you why carbs are important, in a minute.\n\nWe have good and bad carbohydrates.\n\nBad carbs cause an increase in blood sugar and insulin levels.\n\nBad carbs cause inflammation and poor gut health.\n\nBad carbs increase cravings and appetite, by increasing hormones such as Ghrelin.\n\nGood carbs can help lower stress and cortisol levels.\n\nGood carbs can maintain healthy thyroid levels and metabolism\n\nGood carbs can decrease hunger and Leptin levels, another hormone.\n\nAs you can see, it\u2019s a game of hormones. Increase the good ones and decrease the bad ones.\n\nThe end result is less subcutaneous and visceral fat, while also reducing appetite and hunger, so you eat less and lose weight.\n\nSo, what are the \u201cbad\u201d carbs?\n\nYou need to decrease sugars, syrups, sauces, dressings, packaged & refined carbs (such as bread, chips, waffles, muffins, pastries, desserts), sodas, and fruit juices, calorie drinks, alcohol, and so forth.\n\nAnd what are \u201cgood\u201d carbs?\n\nEat healthier, slow-burning carbs such as vegetables, whole fruits, yams, legumes, and similar carbs.\n\nIn fact, let me simplify it for you \u2013 the more natural, the better. The fewer ingredients, the better. No labels = great!\n\nIf it\u2019s something your great-grandmother would have eaten, then it\u2019s good.\n\nSelect Proper Fats For A Flat Stomach\n\nJust like carbs, we have good and bad fats. Fats also cause changes in your hormones, positive or negative.\n\nThe wrong fats cause inflammation, which leads to all sorts of problems, including belly fat.\n\nThe wrong fats can cause insulin problems, increased appetite, fatty liver, and obesity.\n\nSo, my suggestion is to reduce fats such as seed oils like soybean, corn, cottonseed, sunflower, and safflower. You want to try and eliminate vegetable oils and processed fats.\n\nThese are found mostly in packaged foods and when you go out to eat in restaurants.\n\nI keep it simple and have extra virgin olive oil, MCT oil, coconut oil, avocados, and fish oil.\n\nHowever, keep something in mind \u2013 fat DOES convert to fat more easily than carbs and proteins.\n\nIt has twice the calories per gram. It\u2019s denser in calories and it\u2019s a lot easier to eat a bunch of fat calories, than carbs and protein.\n\nAnd yes, calories matter.\n\nSo, just because it\u2019s healthy fat, doesn\u2019t mean you can eat as much of it as you\u2019d like. Because you\u2019ll still gain weight and get fat due to the excess calories.\n\nAs I said, genetics aside \u2013 it\u2019s a game of hormones. Optimize your fat-burning hormones and you\u2019ll burn more belly fat, have more energy, have a faster metabolism, and lower appetite.\n\nPlease read the labels and put in the effort to eat more \u201cgood\u201d carbs and fats, and less of the \u201cbad\u201d ones.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

All of them were put on an exercise program. All consumed the same amount of calories for 3 months.\n\nThey divided the people into 2 groups.

    "content": "Someone asked an interesting question the other day about sugar and more specifically, honey. They asked:\n\n\u201cI read that I should have some sugar before a workout to give me more energy and \u201cfuel\u201d for my muscles, is this true? This expert stated that I should have natural sugar, such as honey. This makes sense, but I wanted to get your opinion Dr. Sam\u201d\n\nSure, I can understand how \u201cfuel for your muscles\u201d before a workout makes sense.\n\nBut, not when it comes in sugar. And it doesn\u2019t make a difference if it\u2019s artificial white table sugar or \u201cnatural\u201d sugar such as honey, fruit, or fruit juice, or agave nectar or anything similar.\n\nAt the end of the day, sugar is sugar.\n\nAnd whether your goal is to gain muscle, lose fat, or simply be as healthy as possible, you MUST manage your blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity.\n\nKeep in mind that \u201cnatural sugars\u201d such as Agave Nectar, similar to honey, contain high amounts of fructose \u2013 which is fruit sugar, which goes mainly into your liver.\n\nUnfortunately, your liver has low amounts of storage capabilities. Only about 25 grams or 100 calories of fructose, before liver glycogen, has hit its \u201climit\u201d. Then it \u201cspills over\u201d and gets stored as body fat.\n\nThus, you need to limit sugars, especially fructose because it can get stored as body fat quickly.\n\nIn fact, let me simplify things a little bit.\n\nWhen you consume carbohydrates, they\u2019re stored in the body in two forms or types.\n\nLiver glycogen \u2013 which is from fructose (fruit sugar, honey, nectars, etc.)\n\nMuscle glycogen \u2013 which is from starches (rice, bread, legumes, etc.)\n\nAgain, I\u2019m oversimplifying things, but you get the point.\n\nNow, the main difference is the AMOUNT of \u201ccarbs\u201d you can store and thus, should eat.\n\nAs stated earlier, your liver can typically store only about 25 grams or 100 calories of fructose, before it \u201cspills\u201d over and gets stored as body fat.\n\nHowever, muscle glycogen has a lot more storage room. You have a lot more muscle.\n\nAnd the more muscle you have, the more starches/carbs you can consume, especially when compared to the small amounts of liver glycogen \u2013 which again, is about 25 grams / 100 calories.\n\nSo, you want to make sure your muscle glycogen has enough fuel for your workouts, which should come ideally from starches and complex carbs \u2013 such as rice, bread, and similar foods.\n\nHowever, you also want to keep your blood sugar stable before a workout so that you don\u2019t crash and get tired. So I suggest a solid meal about 1-2 hours before your workout \u2013 proteins, carbs, and small amounts of fats.\n\nSomething easy to digest. You don\u2019t want to be bloated during your workout.\n\nFor example, chicken, white rice, and small amounts of fat \u2013 such as fish oil, coconut or MCT, flaxseed oil, and so forth.\n\nBy the way, this can be a small meal, it doesn\u2019t have to be big. Of course, this all depends on your goals, your workout, metabolism, and so forth.\n\nWay too many variables to list here. I\u2019m just giving you a simple example.\n\nNow, AFTER your workout, you also want to replenish and fill up your glycogen levels that were depleted from the exercise.\n\nHowever, this time you want to do BOTH \u2013 muscle AND liver glycogen.\n\nYou may have a liquid shake/drink or another solid meal. Again, some starches and complex carbs and protein. However, NOW you can ALSO have small amounts of fructose, to quickly fill up your liver glycogen.\n\nNow you can add in some fruit or honey if you prefer.\n\nSo you\u2019re eating a larger amount of your daily carbohydrates before and after your workout. IF you\u2019re trying to gain extra muscle, you can continue eating more carbs for the rest of the day.\n\nOr if your goal is to lose fat, then simply limit or avoid carbs the rest of the day.\n\nHowever, in both scenarios, NO more fructose since you already filled up your liver glycogen with the fructose after your workout (fruit, honey, etc).\n\nRemember, there\u2019s nothing wrong with carbohydrates \u2013 IF you know how much to take, what kind, and when.\n\nYour goal is and should always be to have healthy blood sugar levels and increase insulin sensitivity. This will result in:\n\nAnd a much healthier life!\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested in making these improvements, you can utilize my favorite solution that can naturally help support healthy blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity at the same time. It\u2019s the same proven formula my family and I have been using since 2001.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health-se/iso-protein-boost-your-workout-with-pure-protein/",
    "content": "Unlock the power of iso protein with our ultimate guide to its nutrition facts.\n\nIso protein has become very popular among fitness enthusiasts due to its ability to aid muscle recovery and growth.\n\nPacked with essential amino acids, iso-protein is an excellent option to boost your protein intake.\n\nWe\u2019ll break down the nutritional profile of iso-protein, exploring its protein content, amino acid composition, and other key elements that make it such a powerful supplement.\n\nOur guide will also cover the different types of iso-protein available.\n\nWhat Is Iso Protein And Why Is It Popular?\n\nIso protein,or isolated protein, is a type of protein supplement derived from various sources such as whey, soy, or peas.\n\nWhat sets it apart from other proteins is its high protein content and low levels of fat, carbohydrates, and lactose.\n\nThe popularity of iso protein can be attributed to its effectiveness in supporting muscle growth and recovery.\n\nThe isolation process used to produce iso protein removes most of the unwanted components, leaving behind a pure protein source. This purity ensures that you are getting a high-quality protein without unnecessary fillers or additives.\n\nAnother reason for the popularity of iso protein is its versatility. You can incorporate it into different types of diets, as it provides a concentrated protein source without an increase in other macronutrients. This makes it an ideal choice for individuals looking to increase their protein intake without compromising their dietary goals.\n\nUnderstanding The Science\n\nTo understand the science behind iso protein, it\u2019s important to first understand the role of protein in the body.\n\nProteins are made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks of muscle tissue. When we consume protein, our body breaks it down into individual amino acids, which are then used for various functions, including muscle repair and growth.\n\nIso protein is specifically designed to provide a high concentration of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are the amino acids that our body cannot produce on its own and must be obtained through our diet.\n\nThese essential amino acids play a crucial role in muscle protein synthesis.\n\nThe isolation process used to produce iso protein involves filtering out most of the unwanted components, such as fat, lactose, and carbohydrates. This results in a protein powder that is highly bioavailable and easily absorbed by the body.\n\nThis means that the amino acids in iso protein can be quickly delivered to the muscles, aiding in muscle repair and growth.\n\nThe Benefits Of Iso Protein For Muscle Growth And Recovery\n\nOne of the primary benefits of iso protein is its ability to support muscle growth and recovery. The high concentration of essential amino acids in iso protein makes it an ideal choice for individuals looking to build lean muscle mass.\n\nDuring intense exercise, our muscle fibers undergo microscopic damage. This damage is necessary for muscle growth, as it stimulates the body to repair and rebuild stronger muscle tissue.\n\nHowever, for this repair process to occur, an adequate amount of protein, specifically essential amino acids, is required.\n\nIso protein provides a convenient and effective way to ensure that your body gets the necessary amino acids for muscle repair and growth. By consuming iso protein post-workout, you can help kickstart the recovery process and provide your muscles with the nutrients they need to repair and grow stronger.\n\nIn addition to muscle growth, iso protein also plays a crucial role in muscle recovery.\n\nAfter a workout, our muscles are depleted of glycogen, which is the stored form of carbohydrates. Consuming iso protein alongside carbohydrates helps replenish glycogen stores, allowing for faster recovery and improved performance in subsequent workouts.\n\nIso Protein Nutrition Facts\n\nWhen it comes to iso protein, understanding the nutrition facts and macronutrient breakdown is crucial for making informed decisions about your diet and supplementation. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the typical nutrition profile of iso protein.\n\nProtein Content: Iso protein is known for its high protein content. A typical serving of iso protein powder, which is around 30 grams, can provide anywhere from 20 to 25 grams of protein. This makes it an excellent source of protein for individuals looking to meet their daily protein needs.\n\nAmino Acid Composition: Iso protein is rich in essential amino acids, including branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These amino acids are essential for muscle protein synthesis and play a crucial role in muscle recovery and growth.\n\nFat and Carbohydrate Content: One of the advantages of iso protein is its low levels of fat and carbohydrates. A typical serving of iso protein contains minimal amounts of fat and carbohydrates, making it a suitable option for those following low-carb or low-fat diets.\n\nLactose Content: Depending on the source of iso protein, lactose content may vary. However, most iso protein powders undergo a filtration process that removes lactose, making them suitable for individuals who are lactose intolerant.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the nutritional profile of iso protein can vary depending on the brand and specific product. Always read the label and check the nutrition facts before purchasing an iso protein supplement.\n\nHow To Choose The Right Iso Protein Supplement\n\nWith a wide variety of iso protein supplements available on the market, choosing the right one can be a daunting task. Here are a few factors to consider when selecting an iso protein supplement:\n\n1. Source of Protein: Iso protein can be derived from different sources, such as whey, soy, or peas. Consider your dietary preferences and any potential allergies or intolerances when choosing the source of protein.\n\n2. Protein Content: Look for iso protein supplements that provide a high protein content per serving. Aim for at least 20 grams of protein per serving to ensure you meet your protein requirements.\n\n3. Amino Acid Profile: Check the amino acid composition of the iso protein supplement. Look for a good balance of essential amino acids, particularly branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which are crucial for muscle recovery and growth.\n\n4. Additional Ingredients: Some iso protein supplements come fortified with additional ingredients, such as vitamins, minerals, or digestive enzymes. Consider whether you have any specific needs or preferences when it comes to these additional ingredients.\n\n5. Flavor and Mixability: While not directly related to the nutritional profile, the flavor and mixability of the iso protein supplement can greatly impact your overall experience. Read reviews and consider trying sample sizes before committing to a larger tub.\n\nTips For Incorporating Iso Protein Into Your Diet\n\nIncorporating iso protein into your diet is relatively easy and can be done in various ways. Here are a few tips to help you make the most out of your iso protein supplementation:\n\nPost-Workout Shake: Consuming iso protein immediately after your workout is an effective way to kickstart the muscle recovery process. Mix one scoop of iso protein powder with water or your preferred liquid for a quick and convenient post-workout shake.\n\nProtein Smoothies: Get creative with your iso protein by blending it into delicious protein smoothies. Combine iso protein powder with fruits, vegetables, and a liquid of your choice to create a nutritious and protein-packed meal replacement or snack.\n\nBaking and Cooking: You can use iso protein for cooking to increase the protein content of your favorite recipes. Experiment with adding iso protein powder to pancakes, muffins, or homemade protein bars for a tasty and protein-rich treat.\n\nProtein Puddings or Yogurts: Mix iso protein powder with Greek yogurt or a plant-based alternative for a protein-packed pudding or yogurt. Add toppings such as fruits, nuts, or granola for added flavor and texture.\n\nRemember to adjust your overall protein intake based on your individual needs and goals. Iso protein supplements should be used as a complement to a well-rounded diet that includes a variety of whole foods.\n\nPotential Side Effects\n\nWhile iso protein is generally safe for consumption, there are a few potential side effects and precautions to keep in mind:\n\nDigestive Issues: Some individuals may experience digestive issues, such as bloating, gas, or diarrhea, when consuming iso protein. This is more likely to occur if you have a lactose intolerance or sensitivity to specific ingredients in the iso protein supplement.\n\nAllergies and Sensitivities: Individuals with allergies or sensitivities to specific ingredients, such as dairy or soy, should choose iso protein supplements that are free from these allergens. Always check the label and consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.\n\nProtein Overconsumption: While protein is essential for muscle growth and recovery, consuming excessive amounts of protein can lead to unintended consequences. It\u2019s important to determine your individual protein needs based on factors such as body weight, activity level, and goals. Consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to determine the appropriate protein intake for your specific needs.\n\nInteractions with Medications: Some medications may interact with protein supplements, including iso protein. If you are taking any medications, especially those related to kidney function, it\u2019s important to consult with a healthcare professional before adding iso protein or any other dietary supplement to your routine.\n\nAs with any dietary supplement, it\u2019s important to use iso protein in moderation and in conjunction with a balanced diet and exercise routine. If you have any concerns or pre-existing health conditions, it\u2019s always best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplementation.\n\nConclusion: The power of iso protein in achieving your fitness goals\n\nIn conclusion, iso protein is a powerful supplement that can aid in muscle growth and recovery.\n\nIts high protein content, amino acids, and low levels of fat and carbs make it an excellent choice to optimize protein intake.\n\nUnderstanding the science behind iso protein and its nutrition facts is crucial for making informed choices about your supplementation.\n\nRemember to consider individual needs, preferences, and dietary restrictions when selecting iso protein.",

    "content": "Please checkout the video summary below, if you\u2019d rather read, instead of watch.\n\nRemember, to maximize muscle growth, you MUST increase your testosterone levels. This is true at any age, male or female.\n\nOtherwise, you\u2019ll minimize your results and feel like you\u2019re wasting time with very little muscle growth and fat loss.\n\nDr Sam Robbins discusses how many times a week to train a muscle for maximum growth.\n\nIf you&#39;re new to it, you should shoot a muscle roughly three times a week, but if you&#39;re doing chest, back, shoulders, arms, lower about all this crap, three times a week is gonna be really long.\n\nArnold did a lot of volume and hit a muscle three times a week.\n\nIn the old days, people would do six sets per body part on a daily basis. Later on, everyone started hitting a muscle twice a week.\n\nIn the 80s, people would do chest, back, legs and arms, then chest, shoulders and triceps, back, biceps and traps, and then lower body. In the 90s, people would do everything once a week, but they would do it harder.\n\nIf you\u2019re a big guy, you should only hit a muscle twice a week. Keep in mind that you\u2019re hitting your shoulders, triceps, and back indirectly when you bench press.\n\nHit Muscle 2x Per Week\n\nYou should hit each body part twice a week, if you\u2019re doing it correctly.\n\nIf you have great genetics and are taking tons of roids, you can hit a muscle once a week. If you aren\u2019t, you can hit a muscle once a week but sometimes you gotta kill it.\n\nYou should hit a muscle between five total sets, working sets a week up to 15 for a three-way split, or two on one off, two on one off, two on one off.\n\nSome people say to do 20 sets a week, but if your cortisol levels are in check and your testosterone levels are in check, you can do 20 sets a week without blowing out your nervous system.\n\nGo five to 15 sets total a week, and most of those sets should be to failure. If you&#39;re going beyond failure, you&#39;re cheating the weight up, so stop grinding it and stop cheating the weight up. I saw pro bodybuilders squeezing it up on every rep and I saw that&#39;s how you&#39;re supposed to do the sets.\n\nMost of your reps should be one or two reps short of failure, and you should only do one or two sets total in each workout for a body part to complete failure. If you do that too much too often, your nervous system will burn out.\n\nThese guys are taking three to four grams of steroids a day and are doing heavy duty training hit training. This is why they get shoulder pain, knee pain, back pain, torn muscles, and don\u2019t feel like working out anymore.\n\nChest & Back Need More!\n\nYou should do 15 sets for chest, 10 for triceps, and so forth, and most sets should be one or two reps short of complete failure.\n\n1-2 Reps Short Of Failure\n\nYou could have probably done one or two extra sets in good form, but you went balls out to failure.\n\nAssuming you can grow and you\u2019re doing good sets, you should go by feel and optimize your hormones. Increase testosterone, decrease cortisol, and optimize your sleep to get the best results.\n\nOptimize Your Hormones!\n\nIf you don\u2019t recover properly after working out, it\u2019s pointless to go to the gym and push yourself, to get bigger and stronger.\n\nIf you can only do 10 good sets and recover and feel good, that\u2019s it. You should leave the gym feeling good, tired but good, and you can kick ass again the next time you come back.\n\nFour to five times a week is all you need in the gym. Hit every muscle group no more than twice a week, and once or twice a week go a little bit beyond failure.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Are you looking to boost your workout performance? The key lies in perfecting your pre-workout routine.\n\nIn this guide, I\u2019ll show you how to optimize your pre-workout timing for the best possible results.\n\nTiming is crucial when it comes to pre-workout nutrition. Consuming the right nutrients at the right time can significantly enhance your performance, strength, and endurance.\n\nWhether you prefer morning or evening workouts, knowing when and what to eat before hitting the gym is essential.\n\nBy incorporating the right nutrients into your pre-workout routine, you can fuel your body with the energy it needs to power through intense training sessions and optimize muscle recovery.\n\nFrom carbohydrates to protein and caffeine, I\u2019ll delve into the science behind pre-workout nutrition to help you achieve your fitness goals.\n\nDon\u2019t let your workouts fall short. Stick with me to discover the perfect pre-workout timing to unlock your full potential in the gym. Let\u2019s take your fitness journey to the next level!\n\nThe Importance of Pre-Workout Timing\n\nTiming plays a crucial role in pre-workout nutrition.\n\nThe food and nutrients you consume before your workout can have a significant impact on your energy levels and overall performance.\n\nWhen you eat, your body breaks down food into glucose, which fuels your muscles during exercise.\n\nBy timing your pre-workout nutrition effectively, you can ensure that your muscles have enough energy to perform at their best.\n\nAdditionally, proper pre-workout timing can help prevent digestive issues during your workout.\n\nEating too close to your training session can make you feel heavy and sluggish while eating too far in advance can lead to a drop in energy levels. Finding the right balance is key.\n\nTo determine the best timing for your pre-workout nutrition, consider factors such as the type of workout you\u2019re doing and your individual preferences.\n\nThe Science Behind Timing\n\nTo optimize your pre-workout nutrition, it\u2019s essential to understand how timing affects nutrient absorption and utilization.\n\nDifferent macronutrients are digested at different rates, influencing their impact on your workout performance.\n\nCarbohydrates provide quick energy, protein supports muscle repair and growth, and fat provides sustained energy.\n\nBy timing your pre-workout nutrition accordingly, you can ensure that your body has the fuel it needs to perform at its best.\n\nIn addition to providing energy, pre-workout nutrition can also affect hormone levels, such as insulin and cortisol.\n\nInsulin helps shuttle glucose into your muscle cells for energy, while cortisol levels can increase during exercise. By timing your pre-workout nutrition properly, you can optimize these hormone levels to enhance your performance and recovery.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss some practical strategies for optimizing your pre-workout nutrition.\n\nPractical Strategies for Pre-Workout Nutrition\n\nTo maximize your workout performance, consider the following tips for pre-workout nutrition:\n\nConsume a balanced meal or snack containing carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats about 1-2 hours before your workout. This will provide your body with the energy it needs to perform at its best.\n\nChoose complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for sustained energy. Pair them with lean protein sources like chicken, fish, or tofu to support muscle repair and growth.\n\nAvoid high-fat or high-fiber foods immediately before your workout, as they can cause digestive discomfort. Instead, opt for easily digestible foods that provide quick energy.\n\nStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after your workout. Dehydration can negatively impact your performance and recovery, so be sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day.\n\nDon\u2019t let your workouts go to waste. By mastering the timing of your pre-workout nutrition, you can optimize your performance, strength, and endurance.\n\nWhether you\u2019re aiming to build muscle, lose fat, or improve your overall fitness, strategic pre-workout timing can help you achieve your goals.\n\nRemember, consistency is key. Stick with your pre-workout routine and make adjustments as needed to find what works best for you. With dedication and effort, you can unlock your full potential in the gym and reach your fitness goals.

    "content": "Today, we\u2019ll dive into the world of protein powders. Are they a fitness game-changer, or should you stick to whole foods? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe Power of Convenience\n\nProtein shake simplifies nutrition. It\u2019s protein in a handy powdered form, perfect for the busy or time-strapped individual.\n\nJust mix it with water, shake it, and you\u2019re good to go. No need to cook.\n\nTypes of Protein Powder\n\nWhen it comes to protein, choices abound. My top picks are whey isolate and collagen protein.\n\nWhey isolate digests effortlessly, while collagen offers benefits beyond muscle growth, such as healthier skin and joints.\n\nWondering when to use protein powder? The answer is simple: before and after workouts.\n\nIt\u2019s quick to digest, making it an ideal pre-workout boost. After exercise, it aids in recovery.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s a lifesaver when you\u2019re in a rush or not in the mood for a full meal.\n\nCalculate Your Protein Needs\n\nDetermining your daily protein requirement is key. A rough guideline is aiming for at least one gram of protein per pound of body weight.\n\nIf you\u2019re on a muscle-building journey, consider exceeding this guideline slightly.\n\nWhy Opt for Protein Powder?\n\nProtein powder is a game-changer, especially for those with busy lives or smaller appetites.\n\nIt\u2019s a quick, hassle-free way to meet your protein goals, eliminating the need for multiple meals.\n\nFor easy digestion, I recommend whey isolate. It\u2019s gentle on the stomach.\n\nAvoid whey concentrate, which can be harder to digest. If dairy isn\u2019t your thing, rice protein is a solid alternative.\n\nIn summary, protein powder can be a valuable addition to your diet, whether you\u2019re a fitness enthusiast or simply looking for a convenient protein source.

    "content": "Today, let\u2019s talk about a simple fitness challenge \u2013 how to lose stubborn fat without high-intensity cardio (HIIT). While HIIT works well, there are other ways to see good results. Let\u2019s dive into these methods.\n\nTo lose weight, eat fewer calories and exercise more. But sometimes, we get the calorie count wrong or overestimate the exercise burn. So, it\u2019s good to track what you eat and make sure you\u2019re burning more calories than you eat.\n\nWeightlifting VS Cardio\n\nWeightlifting is a great alternative to high-intensity cardio. It helps in:\n\nBuilding Muscle: Muscles burn more calories than fat, even at rest. So, the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn.\n\nUsing Carbs Better: Lifting weights helps your body use carbs well, giving you energy and stopping carbs from turning into fat.\n\nAim to lift weights 3-5 times a week to see a change.\n\nApart from HIIT, simple cardio like brisk walking works well, especially after meals. A short 15-20 minute walk helps with digestion and blood sugar control, aiding in weight loss.\n\nPay attention to what you eat. Avoid extra calories from sugary drinks or sauces. Choose healthier options like water or herbal tea.\n\nHealthy fats are good but have them in moderation since they are high in calories. Include a little olive oil and fish oil in your diet daily.\n\nProtein helps in muscle building and keeps you full. Try to eat 1 gram of protein per pound of your body weight daily. If needed, add a good protein powder to your diet.\n\nHormones affect fat loss. Keep an eye on:\n\nTestosterone: Low levels can block fat loss. Try natural supplements, like AlphaViril.\n\nStress Hormones: Stress and bad sleep can stop fat loss. Manage stress and sleep well.\n\nEstrogen: For women, high estrogen can cause fat. Balance it with a good diet and lifestyle.\n\nGood sleep is crucial for fat loss. Make sure you get enough restful sleep.\n\nLosing stubborn fat without HIIT is possible. Weightlifting, tracking calories, choosing healthy foods, eating enough protein, balancing hormones, and sleeping well are keys to success.\n\nStay patient, and dedicated, and keep working towards your fat loss goals. Reach out if you have questions and stay healthy on your fitness journey!\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

I\u2019ll give you the direct link to that article in a minute.\n\nHowever, someone asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s the best time to take my whey protein?\u201d\n\nThe answer to this is simple: take it during and/or after your workout.\n\nThis is because whey protein digests quickly and also increases blood sugar levels. It\u2019s also very high in the \u201canabolic\u201d branch chain amino acids.\n\nYou want it to feed the muscle during and after your workout.\n\nWhat Should I Put In My Shake?\n\nSo what I do is I make a shake consisting of:\n\n50 grams of whey protein isolate (2 scoops = 200 calories)\n\n25 grams of highly branched Cyclic Dextrin (1 scoop = 100 calories)\n\n1 teaspoon of L-glutamine\n\n1 teaspoon of MCT oil (C8, Caprylic Acid only = 50 calories)\n\nI then drink maybe \u00bc of it 30 minutes before my workout. I\u2019ll drink another \u00bc of it halfway through my workout. Immediately after my workout, I drink the remaining \u00bd bottle.\n\nAbout an hour later, I\u2019ll have a solid meal. This would usually be white rice and some wild-caught salmon.\n\nThe reason I don\u2019t drink the shake all at once is that I want it to slowly just feed my muscle, without a huge spike in blood sugar. It\u2019ll keep me \u201canabolic\u201d and more importantly, anti-catabolic during my workout and post-workout.\n\nThus, helping to lower my cortisol levels and keeping my testosterone elevated.\n\nWhat Should I Take with My Shake?\n\nEarlier in the day, before breakfast usually, I\u2019ll have 2-4 pills of AlphaViril to increase my testosterone and improve blood flow. Post-workout, I take my cortisol-minimizing supplements.\n\nOf course, I take a lot more supplements during the day \u2013 but, as far as the workout related, muscle-building and fat-burning formula \u2013 these are the must-take supplements I take year-round.\n\nHere\u2019s the direct link to the original protein article on how to create your own, customized protein powder at a fraction of the price.\n\nAnd also, my favorite, 20+ year proven, testosterone boosting supplement I\u2019ve been taking for 2 decades.",

    "content": "I got a question from one of my readers asking if \u201clifting weights will make me short\u201d?\n\nThis is an interesting question because growing up, I was told to not lift weights because it would make me short. In fact, I was told to \u201cplay basketball\u201d if I want to grow up tall.\n\nAnd, not to play soccer either, since that\u2019ll also make me short.\n\nOf course, this is just idiotic and stupid.\n\nPlaying basketball doesn\u2019t make you tall \u2013 It just happens that TALL people play basketball.\n\nAnd playing soccer doesn\u2019t make you short either \u2014 it just happens that \u201cshorter\u201d people tend to play soccer.\n\nAnd similar to lifting weights, most \u201cmuscular\u201d people are shorter simply because they don\u2019t need to gain as much muscle to look big\u2026 Versus someone like me who is 6\u20193\u201d, I need to gain a lot of muscle to fill out my large frame.\n\nSo it\u2019s a lot more work for me.\n\nHowever, certain exercises can cause damage to your spine, not allowing you to get as tall as you could. Additionally, some exercises CAN actually improve your height, make your shoulders and rib cage bigger, if you do them during puberty and up to the age of maybe 21-23 or so.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll get to the exercises in a minute.\n\nThe Secret To Getting Taller\n\nHowever, genetics aside, the secret to getting taller is to lower your estrogen and increase your testosterone and GH/IGF levels at the same time.\n\nYou see, estrogen fuses the end of the bones and thus, prevents them from growing. This is why girls are actually taller than boys when everyone first starts puberty \u2026\n\nBut after about a year or two of puberty, once estrogen shoots up, the ends of the bones \u201cfuse\u201d and growth and height slows down dramatically.\n\nYet, the boys keep getting taller and taller, slowly\u2026 because they don\u2019t have as much estrogen and have higher testosterone.\n\nAnd when you have a lot more growth hormone and IGF, your bones will keep growing because the ends haven\u2019t \u201cfused\u201d yet because of the high estrogen.\n\nAnd this is why women who typically have naturally big breasts, are shorter. While taller women generally have smaller breasts \u2014 again, due to estrogen.\n\nAnd you\u2019ve probably heard the saying about guys who are \u201cshort, fat, bald, and hairy\u201d.\n\nWell, the \u201cshort and fat\u201d is due to higher estrogen, and the \u201cbald and hairy\u201d is due to higher DHT levels.\n\nAnd in both of these cases, these men also have LOWER testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, all of this only matters if you\u2019re under the age of 23 and are still going through puberty.\n\nAnd yes, genetics does play the biggest role here \u2013 however, if done correctly, you can \u201cnaturally\u201d grow an extra 2-4 inches or more.\n\nAnd yes, I\u2019ve seen this happen many times.\n\nWhich Exercises Make You Shorter?\n\nNow, regarding the exercises that can potentially keep you shorter \u2014 don\u2019t do anything that compresses the spine.\n\nThis means no squats, overhead presses, deadlifts, shrugs, and similar exercises.\n\nInstead, focus on doing pull-ups and \u201cchins\u201d. Not machine pull-downs. You want to pull yourself up and at the bottom, hang for 2 seconds.\n\nThis makes your shoulders wider by stretching out your scapula and decompressing your spine, which will help accelerate the growth of your nerves, CNS, and bone growth.\n\nOf course, there are diet factors as well, but that\u2019s for another article.\n\nJust do your best to eat as naturally as possible and eliminate any foods that can increase your estrogen and decrease your testosterone.\n\nIf you want more information on increasing testosterone and decreasing estrogen, watch a special video about this topic.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "It may seem somewhat strange at first that yoga or \u201cyogasana\u201d can help you lose weight. The moves in yoga are designed for precision and stretching, not for fast action or the typical weight burning exercises that traditional aerobics brings. Nor is yogasana akin to resistance exercises of lifting weights that helps build muscle tissue and burns the away the fat as well.\n\nYet it is true for many thousands of people around the world that yoga is a viable weight loss alternative that is helping people take away the excess pounds and keeping it off as well.\n\nHow does Yogasana Work?\n\nThe key to the exercises involved in yoga start with the fact that you are combining holding different poses and breathing properly at the same time. While seemingly slow in nature, the fact that you have to concentrate to hold the right pose causes the body to burn more calories as a result. Putting your muscles into the effort of just holding a particular pose takes energy which means that your body starts to tap what is available in order to achieve a particular pose correctly.\n\nBreathing properly helps oxygenate the blood so that it can then tap the resources needed to hold a pose for a particular length of time. This is why aerobics works well for many people because as long as the proper breathing is observed, the body can then tap more of its energy reserves to accomplish the task at hand.\n\nThe Advantages of Yogasana for the Body\n\nThere are certainly many benefits from doing this set of exercises when done properly. All it takes is a little focus and concentration that can be achieved either by attending yoga classes or alone in your residence.\n\nInexpensive: You do not need any special equipment, weights or even shoes to do yoga. All you really need is a mat to be comfortable, clothes that stretch with you and the space to do all the proper poses. As long as you follow the steps correctly, this is arguably one of the most inexpensive ways to help you lose weight.\n\nAccessible: Another great advantage is that yoga is accessible to all ages and fitness conditions. Even those who are limited in their movements can still benefit from undergoing this process. Proper yoga is slow, steady and will eventually bring more mobility and strength to the inner core of the body. So, age and financial limitation are no issue when it comes to enjoying the benefits of yoga.\n\nEffectiveness: While the main effect of yoga is to help make the body thinner, it also helps burn away the excess fat as well. Over time, yogasana makes for an effective way to help the body burn the fat, especially when combined with healthy eating practices.\n\nYogasana is a good first step towards losing excessive weight, but you will need to combine it with good, healthy eating in order to help your body burn away the fat. For those who practice yoga, it has been a remarkable tool in helping them slim down and maintain their mobility.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

There could be some advantages and disadvantages to adding ankle weights to your next run, so knowing the pros and cons is important.\n\nWhat Are the Pros of Ankle Weights?\n\n1. It Helps To Build Higher Levels of Bone Density When training with ankle weights, people are giving themselves the chance to not only increase muscle strength, but also increase their bone density. This will reduce the long-term chances of osteoporosis from developing and improvements of bone density are even seen in the senior citizen population.\n\n2. It Increases Calorie Burning Because workouts are stronger, people wearing ankle weights are able to burn more calories over the same period of time than those who don\u2019t wear any weights at all. This helps to make the circulatory more efficient and can ultimately result in weight loss goals being achieved.\n\n3. It Creates More Flexibility Muscles that are working harder are muscles that will be more flexible in the future to changing circumstances. This benefit increases over time because the muscles are getting a good workout and having oxygen pumped into their tissues. Over time, they will then lean out and allow for more movement and flexibility.\n\nWhat Are the Cons of Ankle Weights?\n\n1. It May Increase The Chances Of An Injury Because the joints and muscles are supporting more weight than they are used to supporting, the wearing of ankle weights could contribute to higher levels of muscle strains and joint injuries over the course of a workout.\n\n2. They Don\u2019t Work The Hamstrings Ankle weights might do a good job of giving the leg muscles a workout, but they don\u2019t strengthen the muscles at the back of the leg. With consistent exercise, the leg muscles could become unbalanced and overdeveloped in the front if hamstring exercises, separate from the ankle weight exercises, were not performed as well.\n\n3. They Can Irritate Pre-Existing Injuries For people who already have a knee or ankle injury, adding additional weights to the workout routine can actually increase the chances of having another injury on that joint. It can also add more stress to an already injured joint that would create ongoing pain during the workout that could eventually led to chronic joint issues.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that ankle weights are not for everyone. Anyone with an injury in the legs, either current or past, should avoid using these weights until proper healing is achieved. For everyone else, however, the pros and cons of using ankle weights should be considered to enhance any workout so that all of the benefits can be achieved.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Finding the right exercise device can make all the difference when it comes to getting into better shape. The issue with many traditional forms of exercise, particularly walking and jogging is that while the muscles and cardiovascular system are getting a good workout, the joints like the knees, ankles and hips are taking a pounding that may lead to injury.\n\nThe elliptical machine is arguably one of the most popular exercise devices precisely because it works the arms and legs with very little impact on the body. These machines are particularly popular in gyms and health clubs and many people have them in their home as well.\n\nWhat is an Elliptical?\n\nAn elliptical is an exercise machine that is designed to work the arms and legs. The device has pedals to place the feet and handles for the hands which then move in a back-and-forth manner that mimics in some ways the natural body movement when walking.\n\nThe overall design of this machine is to provide the same type of exercise that walking or jogging provides while working the arms and without the impact that occurs when the feet hit the pavement or ground.\n\nWhat Are the Pros of the Elliptical?\n\nThere are a number of advantages that the elliptical offers, especially when it comes to working the arms and the legs at the same time.\n\nVery Low Impact: The circular motion of the elliptical plus the fact that your feet are not pounding down on the surface of the ground or sidewalk means that your ankles, knees and hips are enduring very little in the way of shock. This means that your joints are far better protected while still getting the workout that you want.\n\nSafe: Injuries when jogging or running often occur when you step on something unexpected from a piece of trash to a dip in the ground. Since your feet never leave the pedals, there is no worry about misplacing a step which significantly reduces the chances of being injured.\n\nWhat Are the Cons of the Elliptical?\n\nAlthough it seems like the perfect exercise machine, there are some mild disadvantages to using the elliptical.\n\nToo Easy: Because there is so little impact on your joints, there have been complaints that it doesn\u2019t feel like you are getting in a good exercise program. Basically, it\u2019s too easy and there is not enough resistance to really make it feel like you are exercising and thus the heart rate and metabolism is not benefiting as a result.\n\nLess Control: Having to place the feet on the pedals actually takes away some from your natural form of movement. This is especially true for someone who is used to jogging or running as it will seem to be an unnatural motion. For those people, an elliptical might not be the best exercise device for their needs.\n\nOverall, the elliptical is a remarkable exercise device that offers millions of people a way to lose weight without the grinding impact on the joints like traditional walking or jogging. For those who are looking for a relatively simple, straightforward way to get into shape, the elliptical is one of the best exercise devices around.\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "Zinc Magnesium Aspartate (ZMA) which is combined with Vitamin B6, has been a favorite of body builders for years when it comes to improving muscle growth. Developed by Victor Conte, the founder of BALCO in the late 1980\u2019s, ZMA was designed to be a safe, natural product that would help bodybuilders boost muscle mass. The fact that BALCO was involve in a doping scandal that involved steroids starting in 2003 did not seem to affect the success of ZMA.\n\nOver the years, many bodybuilders and athletes have sworn by the effects that ZMA has had on their bodies while training. The two main effects sighted were improved testosterone levels and the ability to recover from exercise faster so that additional training could be performed.\n\nThe Theory Behind ZMA\n\nIn the 1980\u2019s there were numerous studies centered on the dropping testosterone production of men as they aged. One of the natural methods explored in boosting that production was the increased intake of zinc. The theory was that additional zinc would help correct the nutritional deficiencies that men experienced as they grew older.\n\nWhile the results of adding additional zinc were mixed, the inclusion of aspartate or aspartic acid did show that the production of testosterone could be increased in the body. Preliminary research indicated that aspartate was important to the synthesis of testosterone and that additional amounts had beneficial effects in older men.\n\nThere have been numerous studies on the effects of ZMA over the years, especially when it came to men who were already healthy and were training in resistance exercises. So far, all the studies have been inconclusive when it comes to the overall effect of increasing testosterone levels in the body. While some of the men did seem to feel better and improve their performance, there was no indication that additional testosterone was produced.\n\nAlthough the studies on ZMA have not provided any real evidence that the product does boost testosterone levels, it is safe to use when taken in normal amounts. However, it is advisable to keep the total amount of zinc consumed below 40mg as such levels can decrease the amount of copper absorption in the body which in turn may result in anemia which can happen over a long period of time. So, as long as the zinc levels in the product are below 40mg, it is safe to take and use in your resistance training.\n\nStill, despite the fact that there is no evidence to show that ZMA can actually boost the level of testosterone production there are still many athletes and body builders who swear by its use. Of course, the psychological impact of believing the product is working arguably has the biggest effect, but the additional zinc to bring the levels in the body up to normal is also good as well.\n\nIf you are considering ZMA as a supplement for the additional production of testosterone, the best advice would be to monitor your own intake of zinc to see if additional amounts are needed to bring the levels up to normal in your body.\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "At the time of this article, it\u2019s Ramadan. This is when Muslims fast for an entire month, from sunrise to sunset. Basically, it\u2019s intermittent fasting for 12 hours, which I just spoke about recently.\n\nAnd, I\u2019ve gotten a LOT of questions about when are the best time and best way to work out and exercise, during Ramadan.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll quickly discuss today.\n\nThis information is perfectly suited for anyone who is doing intermittent fasting, regardless of Ramadan, and also wants to know the best time and way to exercise when doing a 12-hour fast.\n\nShould I Fast Before Working Out?\n\nSo, let me make this quick.\n\nIf your goal is to gain muscle, you NEVER want to lift weights on an empty stomach. Your muscles need glycogen and amino acids for a good workout.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a fasted state, your glycogen stores will be low because you burned through your carbs when fasting and this means you won\u2019t be able to get as many reps, nor will you have as much stamina. So, your workout will be \u201chalf-assed\u201d.\n\nYour body will also be depleted of amino acids since you\u2019ve used up your protein during the fast. Protein needs to be constantly replenished. It\u2019s hard to store it, unlike carbs and fats. And if you lift weights without any amino acids, your body will BREAK DOWN muscle tissue, for the protein and amino acids to help repair your body.\n\nYou again, don\u2019t want this.\n\nRemember, your body\u2019s goal is to SURVIVE. The last thing it wants to do is build muscle. So, you better make sure everything is set up correctly to BUILD muscle, or else your body will focus on general repair FIRST, before building new muscle tissue.\n\nAlways remember, survival comes first, then new growth, and finally, adaptation. Rinse and repeat.\n\nYes, I\u2019ve simplified the process because all of this comes down to having optimal hormones.\n\nIf your body is under stress from fasting and thus, NOT eating and basically, \u201cstarving\u201d\u2026 then your stress and thus, \u201csurvival\u201d hormones are high. This is bad stuff, like cortisol.\n\nYour \u201crepair and growth\u201d hormones such as testosterone, growth hormones, and thyroid are now going to be LOW.\n\nThis is BAD for muscle growth.\n\nSo, in an ideal world, you would eat at least 1 solid meal and preferably 2, then go to the gym.\n\nAfterward your workout, you want to again, eat at least 1 solid meal, preferably 2, to fill up your body again.\n\nThe 2 most important meals are pre and post-workout.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re observing Ramadan or you\u2019re doing intermittent fasting, make sure you follow this simple rule \u2014 eat before and after your workout.\n\nThe rest of the time is up to you and not as important.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nRemember again, it\u2019s all about having optimal anabolic hormones while minimizing negative, catabolic hormones.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve got two important links.\n\nOne is about how you can optimize these hormones, quickly and naturally.\n\nThe second links to my other article about the \u201cBest secret for building muscle, while intermittent fasting\u201d.\n\nHappy Ramadan and wishing you a successful and healthy fast.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "People are always asking me what\u2019s the best way to lose weight. Which, really isn\u2019t your goal because what you really want to do is lose FAT.\n\nAnd most people who try to lose weight, end up losing more valuable muscle and water weight over time. This screws up their hormones and metabolism, resulting in eventual frustration and then they end up gaining all the weight back and usually more.\n\nSo they ask me if there\u2019s a special diet \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a ketogenic or low-carb diet or some sort of fasting. Or if they should be eating lots of protein or some other specialized diet.\n\nThen I have people asking me if exercise is the best way to lose fat. Is it cardio, weight lifting, high-intensity interval training, or some new, scientific protocol used by Olympic athletes?\n\nAnd of course, I also have people asking if there\u2019s a special pill, or a new drug, or maybe some cool herb from the Amazon jungle, or something else that will cause fast fat loss.\n\nNow, the truth is that each of these methods works at the beginning, but your body quickly adapts and the fat loss stops. Then there are negative changes to your hormones, slowing down your metabolism even more.\n\nThe end result is you start to gain weight again and this time, it\u2019s mostly fat \u2013 especially belly fat.\n\nBecause of this, I want you to read my other article on this topic, which reveals the problems with most weight loss plans \u2013 whether it\u2019s diet, exercise, or supplements.\n\nAnd more importantly, the BEST way to lose fat and keep it off, long-term.\n\nIt\u2019ll be easier, safer, and better for your hormones, and you won\u2019t feel deprived or have low energy.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients.

    "content": "I rarely get this question, but it\u2019s an important one \u2013 when is the best time to exercise if your goal is to build muscle? This usually is asked by men, but it also pertains to women.\n\nWell, my generic answer to \u201cbest time\u201d to do anything is always going to be, when YOU can get to it. Some of us can maybe only go to the gym before work or after work or we\u2019re so busy, it can only be on the weekends.\n\nSo, whenever YOU can get to it, then do it. Don\u2019t overthink it. Plan it, schedule it, and then DO IT consistently and you\u2019ll get results.\n\nHowever, in an ideal world, there IS the best time to exercise for building muscle.\n\nNow, the first rule for building muscle is to optimize your hormones. This is extremely important and I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\nThe second rule for building muscle is you need to FEED it and thus, you have to eat a good amount of extra food. There\u2019s NO way around it. Food is your most anabolic substance.\n\nYou can exercise all you want. You can sleep all day long. You can take lots of steroids. But if you don\u2019t eat enough food, gaining muscle is going to be very difficult.\n\nSo you want to make sure you eat at least ONE good meal and preferably, 2 or 3, BEFORE you go to the gym.\n\nYou need to fill up your muscles with enough fuel \u2013 protein, carbs, and fats \u2013 so you can have a good workout, be strong, and have the stamina to lift heavy weights, for enough sets and reps.\n\nThe more VOLUME (sets x reps) you can do and still RECOVER, the more muscle you\u2019ll grow.\n\nAnd recovery starts with food.\n\nSo, don\u2019t even think about going to the gym first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach. You\u2019ll just burn away your muscles. You\u2019ll have no fuel and your body will readily burn MUSCLE before fat for energy \u2013 especially because you\u2019re lifting weights, which uses muscle (protein).\n\nIt\u2019s different than doing cardiovascular exercise, which CAN be done on an empty stomach.\n\nAdditionally, you want to feed the muscle at least 2 good meals after your workout. This means, don\u2019t work out the last thing at night and then go to sleep on an empty stomach.\n\n#1 Best Case Scenario\n\nThus, in an ideal scenario, you\u2019d eat 3 meals, go to the gym, and then eat 3 more meals.\n\nOf course, not everyone can do this \u2013 especially if they have a job. Unless they work out during their lunch hour, which a lot of my clients do. Or you\u2019re in school and you can take off an hour and go to the gym.\n\nAnyway, IF you can do this, great. This is the best option. Three meals before and after your workout.\n\nThe second best option would be a morning workout. You\u2019d eat one good meal (breakfast) and then go to the gym and then eat the rest of your meals during the day. Mornings are better because you\u2019ll get energized and burn more calories for the rest of the day.\n\nThe third best option would be a night workout. You\u2019d come home after work, for example, go to the gym, eat a good solid meal and then go to sleep in an hour or two later.\n\nThis is the last option because exercise increases body temperature and cortisol levels, which stimulates the nervous system (CNS) and thus \u2013 makes sleeping more difficult. But, this is better than no workout.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: You need to get at least ONE meal before and after your workout.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing some kind of intermittent fasting, I would suggest the same thing. Break your fast with at least one meal, then go to the gym and eat again after.\n\nThis, of course, depends on how long you\u2019re fasting. But if you\u2019re going to eat for 8 hours, that gives you plenty of time to feed the muscle before and after the workout.\n\nIt\u2019s All About Your Hormones\n\nAs I stated earlier, (genetics aside) muscle growth is ALWAYS dependent on your hormones.\n\nThis is why women can never get as big as men. This is why a guy in his 50s and older, will never look as good as he did in his 20s \u2014 all having to do with your hormones.\n\nNow, the great part is you can always optimize and maximize your hormones naturally, at any age.\n\nBe Anabolic AND Anti-Catabolic\n\nAnd the reason I tell you to make sure you get at least ONE meal before and after your workout is to manage insulin levels \u2013 which is BOTH anabolic AND anti-catabolic.\n\nBy having some carbs before and after your workouts, as part of a meal (with proteins and a little bit of fat too), you\u2019ll have higher blood sugar and insulin levels.\n\nThis shuttles and moves the food you eat into the muscle for your workout and FEEDS your muscle. This is the \u201canabolic\u201d part (building).\n\nAnd the carbs after your workout (again, with some protein and a little bit of fat) keep blood sugar elevated, which continues to feed the muscle but also LOWERS cortisol \u2013 your \u201ccatabolic\u201d stress hormone. This means that you are now also \u201canti-catabolic\u201d.\n\nREMEMBER: It\u2019s one thing to build muscle \u2013 but you ALSO want to reduce the BREAKDOWN of muscle at the same time. Now you get double the growth, double the progress.\n\nOtherwise, you\u2019ll gain 5 lbs of muscle and lose 5 lbs and end up with no progress, which is what happens to most people.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that as cortisol (stress/catabolic hormone) goes up, your testosterone (anabolic) hormone comes down.\n\nAnd without testosterone, you\u2019ll NEVER gain any muscle.\n\nThus, it comes back to optimizing your hormones \u2014 increasing the \u201canabolic\u201d hormones, while minimizing the \u201ccatabolic\u201d hormones.\n\nAnd if you really want to increase muscle size, then you should consider using a clinically proven testosterone-boosting, hormone-optimizing supplement such as AlphaViril.\n\nNow you\u2019ll have optimal hormonal balance for building muscle, gaining strength, AND losing fat.\n\nPlus, you\u2019ll have a much higher sex drive and libido too, which is always nice.\n\nSo in closing, make sure you feed your muscle with at least one good meal, before and after your weight training workout. This will help build muscle and reduce muscle breakdown.\n\nFinally, add in testosterone boosting, a hormone-optimizing solution such as AlphaViril, to really increase the anabolic, anti-catabolic ratios needed for building more muscle, gaining strength and losing fat.\n\nThen, go rest, and you\u2019ll slowly build muscle over the next few weeks and months.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to talk about CoQ10. I\u2019ll discuss:\n\nWho should take it and why I personally started taking it 20 years ago:\n\nThe negative side-effects\n\nThe best form to take, so you don\u2019t get ripped off\n\nHow you should take it\n\nWhen are the correct times to take it\n\nCoQ10 stands for Coenzyme Q10, which is an antioxidant.\n\nYour body naturally produces it and it does so for generating energy in your cells.\n\nI personally started taking it about 20 years ago because after doing more research about it, I discovered that not only will I have more natural energy all day long, but my workouts would be better.\n\nI would be able to do more reps, more sets, improve recovery, and thus, build more muscle and strength.\n\nSounds pretty awesome and as usual, I doubled and tripled the dose.\n\nThe results were pretty amazing. I really did have a ton of energy.\n\nI was never jittery. I had better focus. It was great.\n\nHowever, I also had massive insomnia. It was like I had TOO much energy.\n\nYet, I never felt run down or tired, from the lack of sleep.\n\nHowever, after a few weeks, something just felt off and I decided to lower the dose so I can get more sleep.\n\nAnd this is a common side-effect if you take too much of the CORRECT form\u2026 which I\u2019ll get to in a minute.\n\nAs to WHO should take it:\n\nCoQ10 For Heart Health\n\nAnyone who wants to and needs to improve the health of their heart.\n\nThis means improving cholesterol levels, blood flow, and blood pressure.\n\nHowever, anyone who is taking statin cholesterol-lowering drugs MUST take additional CoQ10.\n\nIn fact, I got my parents off of these cholesterol-lowering drugs and I created CholesLo for them.\n\nThis naturally supports healthy cholesterol levels, improves HDL/LDL ratios, and fatty triglycerides, and has a lot more hearth-health benefits.\n\nAnd of course, it also contains the correct form and amount of CoQ10 as well.\n\nI highly recommend you utilize CholesLo if you\u2019re concerned about cholesterol levels, and:\n\nMuscle damage, especially to the heart\n\nBlood pressure problems\n\nYou can get more details about CholesLo below\u2026\n\nCoQ10 For More Energy\n\nThe second reason you\u2019d take CoQ10 is for the same reason I did \u2013 to have more energy physically and mentally.\n\nThis is also why I have CoQ10 and PQQ, both similar compounds in my Body-Brain Energy product.\n\nHowever, if you want to take CoQ10 by itself, no problem\u2026 just make sure you do it correctly, which is the next topic.\n\nHow & When To Take CoQ10\n\nThe best time to take CoQ10 is in the morning because of the increased energy levels. Do not take it late in the day or before bed because of the insomnia issue.\n\nSince CoQ10 is fat-soluble, take it with food.\n\nThere are two different forms of CoQ10\u2026 Ubiquinone and Ubiquinol, which is the more active form.\n\nGenerally speaking, older people tend to absorb the Ubiquinol version better.\n\nGranted, some studies don\u2019t confirm this.\n\nAnd other studies show there\u2019s a synergy between them.\n\nBecause of this, I personally take BOTH versions and CholesLo also contains both versions as well, for optimal performance.\n\nFinally, we need to speak about the dosage.\n\nThis really varies from person to person.\n\nThe older you are, the higher the dose one needs.\n\nFor example, when I was younger, in my 30s and even early 40s, 30 mgs daily is all I could take before I\u2019d get insomnia.\n\nThen in my late 40s I noticed I needed 50mgs and sometimes even 100 mgs.\n\nMy suggestion is to start low and build up \u2026 50 mgs is a good starting dose.\n\nIn CholesLo, the daily dose comes out to 80 mgs.\n\nI know people who take 300-500 mg or more daily and say they don\u2019t feel much. This is typical because it\u2019s an inferior form or just a bad product.\n\nIn summary, I highly recommend taking CoQ10 if you want more energy, especially if you\u2019re over the age of 40 and for sure if you want to have a healthy heart and are taking cholesterol-lowering medications.\n\nEnergy and heart health are the two biggest reasons, and whole-body, anti-aging benefits as well.\n\nI\u2019ve got links to both CholesLo and Body-Brain Energy for anyone who wants to support healthy cholesterol levels naturally and for anyone who wants more energy physically and mentally.\n\nBoth options do contain the correct form of CoQ10.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Cholesterol Levels\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy cholesterol levels is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (heart & brain health, sexual performance, arteries, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.) Plus, AGING is another major factor (not just lifestyle)...\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy cholesterol\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/weight-loss/best-time-to-exercise-for-losing-fat-shrinking-your-belly/",
    "content": "Today I\u2019m going to reveal the best time to exercise if your goal it to lose weight, especially that stubborn belly fat.\n\nAnd yes, this works for BOTH men and women, at any age.\n\nNow, gaining muscle is a very different metabolic goal than losing fat. In fact, they are on opposing sides.\n\nExcept for the small minority who have exceptional genetics and/or are taking steroids and other \u201cmetabolic enhancing drugs\u201d, you can\u2019t do BOTH at the same time \u2013 unless you JUST started exercising.\n\nHowever, today I\u2019m going to show you that you actually CAN gain muscle and lose fat \u2013 but today\u2019s topic is more specific about you losing FAT and more importantly, keeping it off.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started.\n\nHere\u2019s a very simple trick for losing fat \u2013 take a 10-15 min brisk walk, after you eat a meal. So, this would be preferably 3x daily \u2013 breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nYou can take a walk outside and just walk 5-7 min in one direction and then turn around and walk back. That\u2019s it.\n\nI\u2019m not asking you to walk 20-30 minutes. In fact, that\u2019s too much.\n\nJust 10-15 minutes and thus, about 30-45 minutes in total, daily.\n\nPersonally, I love this because, after 10-15 minutes, I\u2019m just bored anyway.\n\nNow, the benefits are that:\n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019ve walked 30-45 minutes and thus, 15-20 HOURS a month. And it can be done anywhere, anytime and it\u2019s free. So, NO excuses. That\u2019s a lot of extra calories burned.\n\nIt improves digestion, which means the nutrients are going to be utilized for energy, rather than fat storage.1\n\nIt lowers cortisol levels, the stress hormone. This means less belly fat, higher testosterone, growth and thyroid hormones \u2014 all burning more fat.\n\nLowers blood sugar levels by up to 50-60%. And high blood sugar stores the food in the fat cells.3,4\n\nIt also helps lower blood pressure \u2013 which may not do much for burning fat, but it is good for your heart.2\n\n#2 \u2013 First Thing In The Morning\n\nThe next best time to exercise is first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach \u2013 in the fastest state. Mind you, not with weights \u2013 but again, cardio. And, I would limit it to fast-paced walking.\n\nIn the morning, you have very little glycogen in your muscles and liver. By doing cardio \u2013 more specifically, fast walking \u2013 you\u2019ll burn much more fat since you have very little carbs in your body.\n\nHowever, if you lifted weights on an empty stomach, you will burn some fat \u2013 but you\u2019ll burn more muscle. This is because lifting weights requires glycogen (carbs) and amino acids (muscles). IF you have no carbs in your system, your body will now burn muscle.\n\nThis is why you always want some food in your body, before a weight-lifting session, which is what I explained in detail in a previous article.\n\nSo do your cardio, fast-pace walking, first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach.\n\nAnd if you take a fat-burning supplement, which increases your metabolism \u2013 such as Lean Optimizer, you\u2019ll easily burn 2-3x more fat and have more energy as well.\n\nBut, I\u2019ll tell you more about this in a minute.\n\n#3 \u2013 After A Weight Training Session\n\nFinally, the 3rd best time to do your cardio session is AFTER your weight-lifting session. Ironically, MOST people do it the opposite.\n\nThey\u2019ll do cardio for 30 minutes and THEN lift weights for 30 minutes. This is totally wrong.\n\nYou\u2019ll burn less fat and actually lose more muscle.\n\nBy lifting weights first, you\u2019ll use up all of your glycogen (carbs) in your muscles and liver. Now, all that\u2019s left is \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cfat\u201d. By doing cardio, such as a brisk walk, you\u2019ll go right into FAT BURNING mode.\n\nBUT, if you were to do strenuous cardio, such as running \u2013 you\u2019ll burn fat, but you\u2019ll ALSO burn more muscle because there are no more carbs to burn. You used it all up in your weight lifting session.\n\nSo now, the running will burn fat AND muscle \u2013 this is NOT what you want.\n\nDo a 5-minute warm-up in the bike or something, lift weights for 30-40 minutes, and then finish off with a brisk 20 min walk after your weight-lifting workout.\n\nIt\u2019s Proven \u2013 It\u2019s NOT A \u201cFad\u201d\n\nNow, what I\u2019ve revealed today is proven with hundreds of clients over the past 30 years. From professional athletes to just regular people. Young and old.\n\nIt works and it works EVERY TIME!\n\nThere\u2019s no \u201cfad\u201d method. No \u201cnew scientific research\u201d. This is time-tested and proven.\n\nAnd it\u2019s by far, the BEST long-term solution because it helps to optimize your fat-burning hormones, for continued and long-term success.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of people losing and gaining the weight back. It\u2019s just painful. It\u2019s not good for your body and certainly not emotionally.\n\nDo what I suggested today and if you want to burn even more fat, increase your metabolism, reduce your appetite and boost your energy levels\u2026 while optimizing your primary fat-burning hormones \u2013 then copy the proven formula that\u2019s worked for almost 20 years \u2014 backed by science and more importantly, REAL LIFE results by thousands of people.\n\nSo there you have it!\n\nWalk 10-15 min after each meal \u2013 best option\n\nWalk 20-30 min, first thing in the morning on an empty stomach\n\nWalk 20 min, after your weight-lifting workout\n\nAnd utilize a metabolic, fat burning, hormone optimizing solution such as Lean Optimizer to safely accelerate fat loss, while preserving muscle mass.\n\nImportant \"Fat Burning & Appetite Suppressing\" Shortcut\n\nThere are a few important ways for losing weight & \"erasing\" stubborn belly fat - diet and exercise are two important factors.\n\nUnfortunately, they take time and most people are either NOT patient or need faster results, with less effort...\n\nThis is the exact problem I ran into with myself and private clients. Because of this, I needed to find something that's easy & works quickly.\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"fat burning, weight loss\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18392240\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12166607\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19560716\n\nhttps://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2013/06/03/dc13-0084.abstract",

    "content": "Some men, especially as they get older or if they have hormonal imbalances, dribble some urine after they finish peeing.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s a medical term for this, called post-micturition dribbling (PMD) or post-void dribbling (PVD).\n\nIt tends to be more common as men age because the muscles surrounding the urethra \u2013 don\u2019t squeeze as hard as they once did. Basically, the muscle is getting weaker.\n\nThis leaves a small pool of urine at a dip in the urethra behind the base of the penis, which dribbles later.\n\nCause #1 \u2013 Weaker Muscles Thus, one of the causes is due to weaker muscles, I\u2019ll give you a simple exercise you can do anywhere you want, anytime you want that will help strengthen this area.\n\nCause #2 \u2013 PBH The other cause of this can be due to prostate problems or prostate growth \u2013 called BPH \u2013 which stands for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Due to aging and mainly hormonal imbalances \u2013 your prostate gland enlarges and can partially block the flow of urine out of the bladder, which will then cause excess dribbling.\n\nThe bad news is that if this isn\u2019t dealt with, it can lead to prostate problems.\n\nThe good news is that you can easily and naturally shrink the sizes of your prostate to healthy and youthful levels simply by optimizing your hormones.\n\nWeaker muscles and prostate growth are both due to hormonal imbalances. Mainly a decrease in testosterone, which is an increase in DHT, female, and stress hormones.\n\nSolution #1 The first one is to simply wait about a minute after you\u2019re done peeing and let the extra urine naturally come out. You can speed up the process by \u201cmilking out\u201d the last few drops by putting your fingers behind your scrotum and gently pressing or pushing forward, to get the remaining pee out.\n\nSolution #2 The next thing you want to do is strengthen the muscles around the pelvic area and to do this, you will do Kegels. Kegels will also help improve your erection strength, so it\u2019s a double bonus.\n\nSolution #3 The most effective and important solution is to improve your hormones. It\u2019ll improve this problem, prostate growth, erections, muscle mass, etc. The simplest and fastest way is to take specific vitamins, minerals, and herbs.\n\nUrine dribbling is a sign of a bigger problem down the road, just as is prostate growth.\n\nIf you don\u2019t do something about this NOW, it WILL only get worse and can lead to much bigger health problems. Including prostate problems and impotence.\n\nSpeak to your doctor, take action on the solutions I\u2019ve listed and then let me know how things have worked out for you.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

I cover this in my video if you\u2019d like more details about how to make quick improvements in how you feel.\n\nThe other 50% of your happiness is partly due to your genetics, which is controlled by the above mentioned hormones and neurotransmitters. The good news is that you CAN actually \u201cmanipulate\u201d and improve your hormones, as I cover in my free video.\n\n5 Tips For Improving Your Mood Instantly\n\nNow, there are also things you can do to make quick improvements in your hormones, which can make you feel better and happier almost instantly:\n\nGo outside and get some sun, all you need is 20-30 minutes daily.\n\nExercise daily, especially outside if you can (go for a fast walk). Again, you only need about 20-30 minutes. Try to combine both weights and cardio \u2013 either in the SAME workout or on alternate days.\n\nEat more natural foods and less processed foods. Definitely try to eliminate sugars or anything artificial. High insulin/blood sugar levels causes a negative change in your hormones and causes anxiety and depression.\n\nGet to bed earlier so you can improve deeper sleep because rest helps lower your stress hormone, cortisol.\n\nTake natural herbs, vitamins and minerals that are clinically proven to help naturally boost your mood.\n\nThe above can give almost instant results and it all starts with your physical body. As the saying goes, \u201cmotions creates emotions\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s All About Your Attitude\n\nNow, there are also things you can do that are controlled by your MIND, rather than your body:\n\nFocus on the SOLUTIONS in your life, rather than the \u201cproblems\u201d. I\u2019m not saying to not feel badly or have negative emotions, but it\u2019s much better to spend the majority of your time focused on a positive solution, rather than negative problems.\n\nHelp others\u2026 By focusing on GIVING and helping other people, your mind will NOT be focusing on your own personal problems.\n\nHave an \u201cattitude of gratitude\u201d. If you focus on what you HAVE, rather than what you don\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019ll be much happier because you\u2019ll realize that you already have abundance, hope and options \u2014 which means a lot more happiness!\n\nIt\u2019s natural to have \u201cbad\u201d days\u2026 and that\u2019s okay because without them, we can\u2019t appreciate the GOOD days.\n\nBy utilizing the above proven tactics, combined with the right hormonal balance \u2014 utilizing clinically proven solutions like ProVanax, you can quickly \u201cturn that frown, upside down\u201d",
