    "content": "It\u2019s 2025 and today I\u2019m going to reveal a super simple and easy form of exercise, that anyone can do, anywhere, at any age\u2026 which in some studies is more effective than Metformin for promoting healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nIn fact, it can be TWICE as effective.\n\nAgain \u2013 it\u2019s easy, at no cost, can be done anywhere, with no special equipment and even if you\u2019re somewhat disabled or are in a lot of pain, this exercise can still be done.\n\nVery Popular Drug For Blood Sugar\n\nUnhealthy blood sugar levels are a leading cause of\u2026 and are linked to\u2026 numerous health problems.\n\nSimply stated, it accelerates aging from head to toe, inside and out.\n\nA very popular drug, that has a fairly safe track record, that is prescribed to help control blood sugar, and is also used for longevity, is called Metformin or Glucophage\n\nIncidentally, I used this drug in the early \u201990s. Yes, almost 30 years ago.\n\nHowever, I did not use it for lowering blood sugar or diabetes or for anti-aging reasons.\n\nInstead, I used it in the hopes of building more muscle by improving glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity.\n\nUnfortunately, Metformin gave me a lot of stomach problems. Which is a very common side effect.\n\nI also was NOT digesting my carbohydrates better and ultimately, it led to me slowly losing muscle and strength \u2013 the exact opposite of my original goal.\n\nSo, I stopped using it and instead, used other natural ingredients.\n\nSimple Exercise For Blood Sugar\n\nSo, the exercise that has been shown to work better than Metformin at promoting healthy blood sugar levels is a brisk walk.\n\nYou only need to do it for 10-15 minutes.\n\nBut it needs to be after a meal, but even before is okay.\n\nIdeally, you would do a walk after each meal. For example, 10-15 minutes after breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nThis is how people do it in Europe. They eat a meal, then go for a nice walk.\n\nNot only have clinical studies shown that it works just as well or even TWICE better than metformin, but walking also has numerous other health benefits \u2013 for your heart, mind, blood pressure, and of course, blood sugar.\n\nAnd with NO side effects. NO costs. NO gym or special equipment.\n\nIf you can\u2019t go outside for a walk after a meal you can simply do a little bouncing on a rebounder \u2013 which is a mini-trampoline.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how old you are or if you have back or knee problems. Just walk outside or if that\u2019s not possible, use the rebounder \u2013 both are easy on your joints and great for your health.\n\nDon\u2019t forget, that there are also specific herbs that will also help promote healthy blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity with a normal range.\n\nThat\u2019s double the benefits.\n\nUse them in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle you\u2019ll have more energy, better mood and hopefully love a long and healthy life.\n\nImportant \"Healthy Blood Sugar\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that healthy blood sugar is very important for your health, fitness & longevity (brain & heart health, muscles, fat loss, sexual performance, energy, etc.).\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"healthy blood sugar\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",

    "url": "https://www.drsamrobbins.com/mens-health/doctor-reveals-the-4-primary-ways-to-build-muscle/",
    "content": "At the age of 6, when I first moved here to America from Italy \u2013 I saw my first muscle magazine and I was mesmerized by the idea of getting big, strong, muscular, and lean.\n\nSadly, I have some crappy genetics and gaining muscle and losing fat has always been an uphill battle for me. But I\u2019ve never given up and in the process, I\u2019ve learned everything there is to gaining muscle and losing fat, naturally.\n\nThis also probably explains why I became an anti-aging, endocrinology doctor \u2013 which is the study of hormones.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve coached professional and Olympic athletes, including lots of bodybuilders.\n\nLearn From My Mistakes\n\nAnd during the past 3+ decades, I\u2019ve made a million mistakes. I\u2019ve done everything wrong because I read all the stupid advice in the muscle magazines or from guys who had gotten genetics and were taking tons of drugs.\n\nBasically, it was all bullshit! Lies!\u2026\n\nSo today, I\u2019m here to pass on all of my wisdom, so you can learn from my mistakes.\n\nI\u2019ve updated this topic for 2025 and simplified the entire process of gaining muscle to 4 simple and clinically proven \u201cingredients\u201d.\n\nIt Works For Everyone!\n\nNo matter what you read or do, these \u201ctactics\u201d will produce 90% of all your muscle. You\u2019ll get the most \u201cbang for your time\u201d, so please pay attention and save yourself the hassle in the future.\n\nBy the way, what I\u2019ll reveal today works for EVERYONE, every single time \u2014 young and old, man or woman.\n\nIt works for guys who have crappy genetics and it\u2019ll work even better for guys who have \u201cgood\u201d genetics.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m going to keep today\u2019s article very short and just give you the main bullet points. Enough for you to absorb the information, take action today and start getting results.\n\n4 Primary Ingredients For Building Muscle\n\nBefore anything can be said and done, you must have the right hormones for building muscle. They need to be optimized and this primarily has to do with the increase in testosterone levels \u2013 both men and women, young and old..\n\nWe all have different genetics and please don\u2019t compare yourself to someone else who might have great genetics and then think there\u2019s something wrong with you.\n\nJust like someone who is a genius and has a high IQ, some people are just born with lots of muscle cells and the perfect hormones for building muscle and losing fat.\n\nIf you don\u2019t optimize your hormones, anything else you do will NOT work and it\u2019ll be a waste of effort, time, and money.\n\nIn fact, the right and optimal, youthful hormonal environment will make you grow muscle without doing anything \u2013 no exercise, diet, or supplements.\n\nAnd, this is exactly what happens when you hit puberty, and all of a sudden you start getting muscular, leaner, more aggressive, hornier, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s ALL about the hormones.\n\nAnd this is why women can do the same exercise, diet, and so forth as a man, and they will NEVER get anywhere near the muscle size \u2014 they don\u2019t have the right hormones.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll expand on this topic in about a minute, so don\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nBut let\u2019s move on to the second most important ingredient and that\u2019s EXERCISE\n\nIn order for muscle to grow, it FIRST needs to be \u201cstimulated\u201d and that requires exercise. The correct form of exercise ALSO produces important hormones and growth factors, that will build muscle.\n\nAnd in order to do this, you need to lift weights.\n\nNow, this can be with dumbbells, barbells, cables, machines, or your own body weight. It doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nYou should exercise 3-4x weekly, no more.\n\nKeep your workouts to about 45 minutes or less.\n\nWork quickly, with about 60-90 seconds of rest between sets.\n\nSqueeze the muscle, don\u2019t just lift it. FEEL it. Contract it. Be strict. Go for a good pump.\n\nYou should do about 6-15 repetitions for your upper body and 10-20 reps for your lower body.\n\nGo close to failure on your sets. Maybe 1 rep short.\n\nDo about 6-10 total sets per muscle.\n\nMix things up and try various different exercises and reps \u2013 see what works for YOUR body.\n\nEverything I\u2019ve stated has to do with optimizing your anabolic hormones (testosterone, growth peptides, etc.) and minimizing your catabolic hormones (cortisol, adrenal hormones, etc.)\n\nOkay, now that you\u2019ve stimulated the muscle, and have produced the right hormones, it\u2019s time to FEED your muscles.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feed your muscles, the workouts will cause you to LOSE muscle.\n\nIn fact, this is what happened to me when I first started. I thought I\u2019d lift weights to make my muscles grow and then eat less food to lose fat.\n\nBut all I did was get smaller and weaker. I was like an anorexic.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t need that much extra food. Increase your calories by about 250-500 days and see how you look and feel after a month. If you\u2019re not getting fat, then good. If you are, lower the calories a little.\n\nThis has to do with YOUR body, so listen to it, and pay attention. As far as WHAT to eat. Okay\u2026 this is where all the confusion comes. Most people eat way too much protein.\n\nThe people who tell you to eat more and more protein, are SELLING you protein supplements \u2026 or, they\u2019re idiots.\n\nListen \u2013 the time you\u2019re growing the FASTEST in life is when you\u2019re a baby \u2013 right?\n\nAnd mother\u2019s milk is only 5% protein. One cup has only 2.5 grams of protein \u2013 the rest is fat and carbs.\n\nWith that said, the MOST you\u2019ll ever need is 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. So if you weigh 150 lbs, you need 150 grams. NOTHING MORE got it!\n\nHell, this even includes guys who are taking a ton of steroids.\n\nYour protein should come from grass-fed bison, salmon, whole eggs, whey isolate, and collagen protein. These are my favorites. Whatever you do, NO processed meats.\n\nNext, you need fats. Most people don\u2019t eat enough good fats and/or are eating too much of the bad fats. Your diet should be about 25% fat, from healthy sources such as coconut, olive, macadamia nut oils\u2026 raw nuts and seeds (no peanuts and or cashews) \u2026 and avocados are good too.\n\nFinally, you need carbohydrates. Stay away from processed carbs and simple sugars.\n\nEat vegetables, white rice (NOT brown), yams, sweet potatoes, small amounts of fruits, legumes, and other whole grains.\n\nSimple, easy, and effective.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve stimulated and fed the muscle, you need to REST it. Just like a baby, you need your rest to grow.\n\nAs far as sleep, get as much as you need. Some need 6 hours and some need 9. Go to bed before midnight and wake up naturally.\n\nAlso, this means that you don\u2019t go and play sports every day, party all night, and burn out your resources \u2014 which are needed to build muscle.\n\nAgain, rest improves your anabolic hormones (testosterone, growth peptides etc.) and minimizes your catabolic hormones (cortisol, adrenal hormones, etc.)\n\nAnd we come back full circle again to your hormones.\n\nThere are lots of hormones in the body \u2014 but the main one that controls muscle size is testosterone. \u2026 And NO, it\u2019s not GH, MFG, IGF, etc., etc.\n\nYes, there are growth factors such as Myostatin inhibitors, but that\u2019s not something you can control \u2013 it\u2019s a \u201cgenetic\u201d thing, so let\u2019s not talk about it.\n\nTestosterone is the hormone that turns a \u201cboy\u201d into a MAN!\n\nIt\u2019s the main hormone that differs in quantity for men and women. Thus, why women can NEVER get as big as men \u2014 UNLESS they take lots of steroids, which are derived from testosterone.\n\nSome guys produce more testosterone than others. And ALL guys produce LESS testosterone as they hit their mid 20\u2019s.\n\nSadly, not only do we start to produce LESS testosterone, but we also produce MORE of the negative hormones such as estrogen, cortisol, etc.\n\nImportant \"Testosterone & Libido Boosting\" Shortcut\n\nI think we can all agree that boosting testosterone levels and having a healthy hormone profile is very important (muscles, sexual performance, fat loss, brain health, etc.)\n\nUnfortunately, most of us don't have the time, money or devotion to make big lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management, etc.)\n\nWell, the good news is that now you can quickly achieve your \"testosterone boosting\" goals with ONE simple solution that's easy, convenient & requires NO lifestyle changes...",
